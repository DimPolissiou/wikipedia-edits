Spanish swimmer, politician and motivational speaker who has won a total of 26 [[Spain at the Paralympics|Paralympic]] medals at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], [[2004 Summer Paralympics]], [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics]], with six of those medals earned at the 2012 London Games. She is the most decorated Spanish Paralympian in history.\n\nIn 1995, at the age of nineteen, Perales was diagnosed with [[neuropathy]] and lost the use of her legs within three months. Following the 2000 Games, she earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy and married [[Mariano Menor]]. She later had a child with him following the 2008 Games. In addition to swimming, Perales has been a politician, teacher, entrepreneur and motivational speaker. As an [[Aragonese Party]] (PAR) politician, she was in office from 2003 to 2007. Following her departure, she co-wrote an autobiography with her husband. Despite having no plans to return to politics, she was symbolically on the 2011 ballot for PAR as a member of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congreso de los Diputados]]. Perales has supported a number of causes including [[Doctors Without Borders]], Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Sanz and Fundaci\u00f3n Vicente Ferrer.\n\nTaking up swimming at the age of 19, she joined the Aragon-based disability sport club CAI CDM a year later. A year after that, in 1997, she competed in her first Spanish championships, in which she earned several medals. The following year, she made her national team debut at the [[IPC Swimming World Championships|IPC (International Paralympic Committee) Swimming World Championships]] in Christchurch, New Zealand, where she earned a bronze medal. She then went on to compete in the 1999 European Championship, 2000 Summer Paralympics, 2001 European Championships, 2002 IPC World Championship, 2004 Summer Paralympics, 2006 IPC World Swimming Championship, and 2008 Summer Paralympics. She took a break from swimming following the 2008 Games to give birth to her son. She returned to the pool in 2011 for the European Championship and then competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

(classification)|S5, SB4, SM5 classified]] Spanish swimmer, politician and motivational speaker who has won a total of 26 [[Spain at the Paralympics|Paralympic]] medals at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], [[2004 Summer Paralympics]], [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics]], with six of those medals earned at the 2012 London Games. She is the most decorated Spanish Paralympian in history.\n\nIn 1995, at the age of nineteen, Perales was diagnosed with [[neuropathy]] and lost the use of her legs within three months. Following the 2000 Games, she earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy and married [[Mariano Menor]]. She later had a child with him following the 2008 Games. In addition to swimming, Perales has been a politician, teacher, entrepreneur and motivational speaker. As an [[Aragonese Party]] (PAR) politician, she was in office from 2003 to 2007. Following her departure, she co-wrote an autobiography with her husband. Despite having no plans to return to politics, she was symbolically on the 2011 ballot for PAR as a member of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congreso de los Diputados]]. Perales has supported a number of causes including [[Doctors Without Borders]], Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Sanz and Fundaci\u00f3n Vicente Ferrer.\n\nTaking up swimming at the age of 19, she joined the Aragon-based disability sport club CAI CDM a year later. A year after that, in 1997, she competed in her first Spanish championships, in which she earned several medals. The following year, she made her national team debut at the [[IPC Swimming World Championships|IPC (International Paralympic Committee) Swimming World Championships]] in Christchurch, New Zealand, where she earned a bronze medal. She then went on to compete in the 1999 European Championship, 2000 Summer Paralympics, 2001 European Championships, 2002 IPC World Championship, 2004 Summer Paralympics, 2006 IPC World Swimming Championship, and 2008 Summer Paralympics. She took a break from swimming following the 2008 Games to give birth to her son. She returned to the pool in 2011 for the European Championship and then competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. She earned at least one medal in every Paralympics, European Championship, and World Championship in which she competed.\n\nBecause of her sporting achievements, Perales was awarded the [[Royal Order of Sports Merit|Gran Cruz del M\u00e9rito Deportivo]] and the Medalla de Oro de la Real Orden del M\u00e9rito Deportivo. She has earned several other honors including being named the Woman of the Year by the Spanish women's magazine ''[[Mujer hoy]]''.\n\n==Personal==\nPerales was born in [[Zaragoza]] on 29 December 1975.<ref name=ipc1 /> She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her.<ref name=hoymueres /> When she was 15 years old, her father died from [[leukemia]], and she was then raised by her single mother.<ref name=hoymueres /><ref name=lifejacket2 /> At the age of 19, she developed [[neuropathy]] and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period.<ref name=ipc1 /><ref name=hoymueres /> The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it.

London: Routledge, 1994.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Rocinha road 2010.JPG|thumb|300px|Funk carioca was born in the 1980s in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[favela]]s.]]\n\nFunk carioca was once a direct derivative of [[Samba]], [[Afrobeat]], [[Miami bass]], [[Latin music]], [[Traditional African religions|traditional African religious]] music, [[Candomble]], [[Hip-Hop]] and [[Freestyle music|freestyle]] (another Miami-based genre) music from the [[Music of the United States|United States]]. The reason why these genres, very localized in the US, became popular and influential in Rio de Janeiro is due to proximity. Miami was a popular plane stop for Rio DJs to buy the latest American records. Along with the Miami influence came the longtime influence of the [[slave trade]] in [[Colonial Brazil]]. Various African Religions like [[Vodun]], and [[Candomble]] were brought with the enslaved Africans to the [[Americas]]. The same beat is found in Afro-Religious music in the [[African Diaspora]] and many black Brazilians identify as being part of this religion. This genre of music was mainly started by those in [[black communities]] in Brazil, therefore a boiling pot of influences to derive the trademark.\n\nMany similar types of music genres can be found in [[Caribbean]] island nations such as; [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Barbados]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], among others. [[Bounce music]], which originates from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], also has a similar beat. New Orleans, originally a French territory, was a hub for [[Atlantic slave trade]] before it was sold to the [[United States]]. All of these areas with similar music genres retain the influence of American [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[African music]] and [[Latin music]].<ref name=\"Eyes On Brazil\">{{cite web|author=tudobeleza |url=http://eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/origins-of-funk-carioca/ |title=Origins of Funk Carioca &#124; Eyes On Brazil |publisher=Eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro played [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Raphael Berr\u00eado (August 09, 2012).

G1.</ref>\n\nFunk carioca was popularized in the 1980s in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[favela]]s, the city's predominantly [[Afro-Brazilian]] slums. From the mid-1990s on, it was a mainstream phenomenon in Brazil. Funk songs discuss topics as varied as poverty, [[human dignity]], [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]] of [[black people]], [[sex]], [[violence]], and [[social injustice]]. Social analysts believe that funk carioca is a genuine expression of the severe social issues that burden the poor and black people in Rio.\n\nAccording to DJ Marlboro, the main influence for the emergence of funk carioca was the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" by [[Afrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force]], released in 1982.<ref>Carlos Albuquerque (September 12, 2012).

[[O Globo]].</ref>\n\nCarioca in its early days were mostly loops of electronic drums from [[Miami bass]] or freestyle records and the 4-6 beat [[Afrobeat]] tempo, while a few artists composed them with actual drum machines. The most common drum beat was a loop of DJ Battery Brain's \"808 volt\", commonly referred to as \"Voltmix\", though Hassan's \"Pump Up the Party\" is also notable.<ref>[http://noisey.vice.com/pt_br/blog/a-historia-do-tamborzao-a-levada-que-deu-cara-ao-ritmo-do-funk-carioca A Hist\u00f3ria do 'Tamborz\u00e3o', a Levada Que Deu Cara ao funk carioca]</ref><ref>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0020-38742014000100009#nt105 A Era Lula/Tamborz\u00e3o pol\u00edtica e sonoridade]</ref><ref name=\"Tamborz\u00e3o\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZhwcFJ_aw |title=TAMBORZ\u00c3O baile funk beats (english version) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Nowadays, carioca funk rhythms are mostly based on tamborz\u00e3o rhythms instead of the older drum machine loops.\n\nMelodies are usually sampled. Older songs typically chopped up freestyle samples for the melody, or had none at all. Modern funk uses a set of samples from various sources, notably horn and accordion [[stab (music)|stabs]], as well as the horn intro to the \"[[Rocky]]\" theme. Funk carioca has always used a small catalog of rhythms and samples that almost all songs take from (commonly with several in the same song). Funk carioca songs can either be instrumental or include rapping, singing, or something in between the two. Popularized by Brazilians and other [[Afro-Latino]] people, the saying \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Bum Cha-Cha\" , \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Cha Cha\" or even \"Boom-Pop-Pop, Pop,Pop\" is a representation of the beat that comes along in most funk songs with the origin of this beat derived from Central and West African music.\n<ref name=\"pitchforkmedia.com\"/><ref name=\"riofunk.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908162256/http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-date=2006-09-08 |url-status=dead |title=RIOFUNK.org - INFORMATION ABOUT BAILE FUNK !!! |accessdate=2014-06-12 }}</ref>\n\nFunk Carioca is different from the funk originated in the United States. Starting in 1970, styles like ''bailes da pesada,'' ''black soul'', ''shaft'', and ''funk'' started to emerge in Rio de Janeiro. As time went on, DJ's started to look for other rhythms of black music, but the original name did not remain.  The term ''baile funk'' is used to refer to the parties in which Funk Carioca is played. Funk Carioca first emerged and is played throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, but not only in the city of Rio, like Rio natives like to believe. Funk Carioca is mostly appealing to the youth. In the decade of 1980, anthropologist Herman Vianna was the first social scientist to take Funk as an object to study in his Masters thesis, which gave origin to the book  ''O Mundo Funk Carioca'', which translates to ''The Carioca Funk World''(1988). During that decade, funk dances lost a bit of popularity due to the emergence of [[disco music]], a [[pop music|pop]] version of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]], especially after the release of the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) starring [[John Travolta]] and with soundtrack of the band [[Bee Gees]]. At the time, the then teenager, Fernando Lu\u00eds Mattos da Matta was interested in the discotheque when listening to the program Cidade Disco Club on Radio City of Rio de Janeiro (102.9 FM). Years later Fernando would adopt the nickname of [[DJ Marlboro]] and the radio would be known as the Rio \"[[rock music|rock]] radio\u201d.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nThere are a number of variants derived from funk carioca.\n\n=== Funk melody ===\n{{Main|Funk melody}}\nFunk Melody is based on Electro rhythms but with a romantic lyrical approach<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Medeiros | first1 = Jana\u00edna | title = Funk carioca: crime ou cultura? | publisher = Terceiro Nome | isbn = 9788587556745 | page = 19}} </ref>. It has been noted for being powered by female artists. The popular Funk melody singers are Perlla, Babi and Copacabana Beat.\n\n=== Proibid\u00e3o ===\n{{Main | Proibid\u00e3o}}\nProibid\u00e3o is a derivative of Rio de Janeiro funk related to prohibited practices. The content of the genre involves the sale of illegal drugs and the war against police agencies, as well as the glorification and praise of the drug cartels, similar to gangsta rap.\n\n=== Funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o ===\n{{Main|Funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o}}\nFunk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o is a sub-genre of Rio de Janeiro funk created in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 2008. The lyrical and thematic content of songs in this style focuses mainly on conspicuous consumption, as well as a focus on materialistic activities, glorification of style of urban life and ambitions to leave the favela. Since then, funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o has been strongly associated with the emerging '' nova classe m\u00e9dia '' (new [[middle class]]) in Brazil<ref> {{Cite news | url = http: //g1.globo.com /globo-news/noticia/2013/11/funk-ostentacao-simboliza-em-sp-emergencia-da-nova-classe-media.html|title=Funk Ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o symbolizes in SP emergeg\u00eancia da 'nova classe m\u00e9dia' | date = November 10, 2013 | work = Globo News | access-date = April 2, 2017 | language = pt-BR}} </ref>.\n\n=== Funk paulista ===\nFunk paulista, also known as '''funk ousadia''', is a style originating from funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o, in the early 2013's. The genre was mainly promoted by the Brazilian audiovisual content channel [[KondZilla]], which spelled names like MC Jo\u00e3o, MC Kevinho, MC Zaac, Jerry Smith and [[MC Fioti]]. The theme of the songs changes from ostentation to a more dancing approach.\n\n=== Pagofunk ===\nA sub-genre of funk paulista, pagofunk is known for the use of ''[[sampler (musical instrument)| samplers]]'' by [[cavaco]] (a typical instrument of [[Pagode]]), typical rhythms of [[hip hop]]/[[Trap music|Trap]] and controversial lyrics.

Then the [[Europe]]an media began to report its peculiar combination of music, social issues with a strong sexual appeal (often pornographic).\n\nIn 2001, for the first time, funk carioca tracks appeared on a non-Brazilian label. One example is the album ''[[Favela Chic]]'', released by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. It contained three old-school funk carioca hits, including the song \"[[Popozuda Rock n' Roll]]\" by De Falla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Favela-Chic-Funk-Favela/release/1352224 |title=Various - Favela Chic: Funk Favela |publisher=discogs |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:M.i.a.1.jpg|thumb|200px|Artist [[M.I.A.

Many funk carioca artists started to do shows abroad at that time. [[DJ Marlboro]] and [[Favela Chic Paris]] club were the pioneer travelers and producers. The funk carioca production was until then limited to playing in the [[ghetto]]s and the Brazilian pop market. DJ Marlboro,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.uol.com.br/bigmix/djmarlboro.html | title = \u00c9 BIG MIX O MAN\u00c9}}</ref> a major composer of funk carioca's tunes declared in 2006 in the Brazilian [[Istok (magazine)|Isto \u00c9 magazine]] how astonished he was with the sudden overseas interest in the genre. He would go on to travel in over 10 European countries.\n\nIn [[London]], duo [[Tetine]] assembled a compilation album called [[Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca]]'','' which was released by [[Mr Bongo Records]] in 2004. Tetine also ran the weekly radio show [[Slum Dunk]] on London's radio art station [[Resonance FM|Resonance Fm 104.4]]. Their radio show was entirely dedicated to funk carioca and worked as a platform for the duo to produce and organize a series of film programs as well as interviews and gigs involving funk carioca artists from Rio.

Apart from this, Tetine also produced two albums with experimental DIY [[queer]] funk carioca: ''[[Bonde do Tet\u00e3o]]'', released by Brazilian label [[Bizarre Records]] in 2004, and ''[[L.I.C.K My Favela]]'', released by [[Kute Bash Records]] in 2005. Tetine also recorded with [[Deize Tigrona]] on the track \"I Go to the Doctor\", included in the LP ''L.I.C.K My Favela'' in 2005 and later on their album ''[[Let Your X's Be Y's]]'', released by [[Soul Jazz Records]] in 2008.\n\nIn Italy, [[Irma Records]] released the 2005 compilation [[Colors Music#4: Rio Funk|Colors Music #4: Rio Funk]]. Many small labels (notably European label [[Arcade Mode]] and [[United States|American]] labels [[Flamin\u00b4Hotz]] and Nossa) labels released several compilations and EPs in bootleg formats.\n\nThe artist [[M.I.A.

She performed her baile funk productions for the contest ''Edison Change the Music'' in 2008. Sandra D'Angelo performed Baile Funk also in New York and produced tracks with [[EDU KA]] ([[Man Recordings]]) and DJ [[Amazing Clay]] from Rio.\n\nIn 2008, Berlin label Man Recordings released ''Gring\u00e3o'', the debut album by German [[MC Gringo]] \u2014 the only non-Brazilian MC performing in the bailes of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nEnglish indie pop band [[Everything Everything]] claim the drum patterns used on their Top 40 single [[Cough Cough]] were inspired by those used on [[Major Lazer]]'s [[Pon de Floor]], a funk carioca song.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn Brazil, funk carioca lyrics are often criticized due to their violent and sexually explicit lyrics, as well as [[misogynist]]ic content. The [[Sexism|degradation of women]] as objects for sex is a recurring theme in funk carioca. Girls are called \"cachorras\" (whores) and \"popozudas\" - large buttocks, and many songs revolve around casual and degrading sex practices with them. \"Novinhas\" (young/underaged girls) as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] are also a frequent theme in funk carioca songs.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-zq-sspQo |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Some of these songs, however, are sung by women.\n\nThe extreme banalization of sex and the incitement of [[promiscuity]] is viewed as a negative aspect of the funk carioca culture. Besides the moral considerations, in favelas, where sanitary conditions are poor and [[sex education]] low, this might lead to [[public health]] and social issues. In such communities, definitive [[Birth control|contraceptive methods]] are hardly available and due to lack of education and awareness, [[family planning]] is close to nonexistent. This environment results in unwanted pregnancies, population overgrowth, and eventually the growth of the communities ([[faveliza\u00e7\u00e3o]]).<ref name=\"www1.folha.uol.com.br\">{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u128489.shtml |title=Folha Online - Cotidiano - Atlas aponta natalidade maior que a m\u00e9dia em favelas da Grande SP - 22/11/2006 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref><ref name=\"rjtv.globo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://rjtv.globo.com/Jornalismo/RJTV/0,,MUL131124-9097,00.html |title=G1 \u2013 Rio de Janeiro: not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos da Globo |publisher=Rjtv.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Glamour (presentation)|glamor]]ization of [[criminality]] in the favelas is also frequently viewed as another negative consequence of funk carioca. Some funk songs, belonging to a style known as \"proibid\u00e3o\" (\"the forbidden\"), have very violent lyrics and are sometimes composed by drug-dealing gangs. Its themes include praising the murders of rival gang members and cops, intimidating opposers, claiming power over the favelas, robbery, drug use and the illicit life of drug dealers in general. Authorities view some of these lyrics as \"recruiting\" people to organized crime and inciting violence, and playing some of these songs are thus considered a crime.<ref name=\"osmelhoresvideos.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osmelhoresvideos.net/video/1614/proibidoes-nos-bailes-funks-das-favelas-do-rio-de-janeiro.html |title=V\u00eddeo \u00bb Proibid\u00f5es nos bailes funks das favelas do Rio de janeiro |publisher=OsMelhoresVideos.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of regulation and the locations where they usually take place, \"[[bailes funk]]\" are also very crime prone environments.

The first version is the one broadcast by local radio stations; the second is played in dance halls, parties, and in public by sound cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sansone, Livio. \"The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio.\" Brazilian Popular Music & Globalization, 139.

This is usually denounced in the lyrics and the hope for a better life is carried through many of their messages.<ref name=\"riofunk.org\"/>\n\nWith its recent success in Europe, it has also been criticized that Brazil is exporting music that is much inferior when compared to the [[bossa nova]] of the 1950s/60s and the [[Brazilian rock]] that had been made famous in the 1980s. It has been rumored that most of the funk projects in favelas are also financially backed by drug lords, so many song lyrics deal with challenging the police together with a subversive nature to the law currently established in Brazil.\n\n===Response===\nDefenders of funk carioca argue that the genre is an authentic expression of the culture of [[Afro-Brazilian]] communities, and the lyrics of a sexual nature reflect the sexual freedom found in Brazilian society.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Surra de Bunda]]\n* [[Miami bass]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1569728,00.html \"Ghetto Fabulous\" Observer Music Monthly article on Baile Funk by Alex Bellos 2005]\n* [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1166677,00.html \"Samba, That's So Last Year\" article by Alex Bellos at The Guardian 2004]\n* [http://www.thefreeradical.ca/in_the_fight_clubs_of_rio_monday.htm \"In The Fight Club Of Rio\" article on \"corridor balls\" at Free Radical by Canadian Nicole Veash 2000]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602043605/http://musibrasil.net/articolo.php?id=1915 Article with Baile Funk master Sany Pitbull by Sabrina Fidalgo at Musibrasil 2007]\n* [https://xlr8r.com/features/the-funk-phenomenon/ \"The Funk Phenomenon\" article by Bruno Natal at XLR8R magazine 2005]\n* [http://www.proibidao.org/funk-carioca-and-musica-soul/ ''Funk Carioca'' and ''M\u00fasica Soul'' by Carlos Palombini]\n{{Hip Hop}}\n{{Lusophonemusic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Funk Carioca}}\n[[Category:Brazilian styles of music]]\n[[Category:Funk carioca| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Primary sources|date=May 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox music genre\n|name=Funk carioca\n|stylistic_origins= {{hlist|[[Miami bass]]|[[electro-funk]]|[[gangsta rap]]|[[Freestyle music|freestyle]]}}\n|cultural_origins= Mid-1980s, [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil\n|instruments= {{hlist|[[Drum machine]]|[[turntabalism|turntable]]|[[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]|[[synthesizer]]|[[rapping]]}}\n|derivatives=\n|subgenres= {{hlist|[[Proibid\u00e3o]]|[[melodic funk]]|[[funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o|funk paulista]]}}\n|fusiongenres=\n|regional_scenes=\n|bgcolor=darkblue\n|color=white\n|popularity= Large mid-1990s and current in [[Brazil]], Moderate mid-2000s in [[Eastern Europe]].\n|subgenrelist=\n|other_topics}}\n\n'''Funk carioca''' {{IPA-pt|\u02c8f\u0250\u0303.ki \u02ccka.\u027ei.\u02c8\u0254.k\u0250|}}, also known as '''favela funk''' and, in other parts in the world, '''baile funk''', is from [[Rio de Janeiro]], derived from [[Miami bass]] and [[gangsta rap]] music.<ref name=\"pitchforkmedia.com\">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16784-rio-baile-funk-favela-booty-beats/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407001434/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16784-rio-baile-funk-favela-booty-beats/ |date=April 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Frere |first=Sasha |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/01/050801crmu_music?currentPage=1 |title=Brazilian Wax |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\n\"Baile funk\", in Brazil, refers not to the music, but to the actual [[Dance party|parties]] or [[discotheque]]s in which the music is played ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8baj.l\u026f}}, from ''baile'', meaning \"dance [event]\").<ref name=\"FavelaFunk\">[http://www.favelafunk.net/Batidao_do_Funk.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118195119/http://www.favelafunk.net/Batidao_do_Funk.htm |date=November 18, 2008 }}</ref> Although originated in Rio, funk [[carioca]] has become increasingly popular amongst working classes in other parts of Brazil.

The reason why these genres, very localized in the US, became popular and influential in Rio de Janeiro is due to proximity. Miami was a popular plane stop for Rio DJs to buy the latest American records. Along with the Miami influence came the longtime influence of the [[slave trade]] in [[Colonial Brazil]]. Various African Religions like [[Vodun]], and [[Candomble]] were brought with the enslaved Africans to the [[Americas]]. The same beat is found in Afro-Religious music in the [[African Diaspora]] and many black Brazilians identify as being part of this religion. This genre of music was mainly started by those in [[black communities]] in Brazil, therefore a boiling pot of influences to derive the trademark.\n\nMany similar types of music genres can be found in [[Caribbean]] island nations such as; [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Barbados]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], among others. [[Bounce music]], which originates from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], also has a similar beat. New Orleans, originally a French territory, was a hub for [[Atlantic slave trade]] before it was sold to the [[United States]]. All of these areas with similar music genres retain the influence of American [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[African music]] and [[Latin music]].<ref name=\"Eyes On Brazil\">{{cite web|author=tudobeleza |url=http://eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/origins-of-funk-carioca/ |title=Origins of Funk Carioca &#124; Eyes On Brazil |publisher=Eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro played [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Raphael Berr\u00eado (August 09, 2012).

G1.</ref>\n\nFunk carioca was popularized in the 1980s in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[favela]]s, the city's predominantly [[Afro-Brazilian]] slums. From the mid-1990s on, it was a mainstream phenomenon in Brazil. Funk songs discuss topics as varied as poverty, [[human dignity]], [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]] of [[black people]], [[sex]], [[violence]], and [[social injustice]]. Social analysts believe that funk carioca is a genuine expression of the severe social issues that burden the poor and black people in Rio.\n\nAccording to DJ Marlboro, the main influence for the emergence of funk carioca was the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" by [[Afrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force]], released in 1982.<ref>Carlos Albuquerque (September 12, 2012).

Older songs typically chopped up freestyle samples for the melody, or had none at all. Modern funk uses a set of samples from various sources, notably horn and accordion [[stab (music)|stabs]], as well as the horn intro to the \"[[Rocky]]\" theme. Funk carioca has always used a small catalog of rhythms and samples that almost all songs take from (commonly with several in the same song). Funk carioca songs can either be instrumental or include rapping, singing, or something in between the two. Popularized by Brazilians and other [[Afro-Latino]] people, the saying \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Bum Cha-Cha\" , \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Cha Cha\" or even \"Boom-Pop-Pop, Pop,Pop\" is a representation of the beat that comes along in most funk songs with the origin of this beat derived from Central and West African music.\n<ref name=\"pitchforkmedia.com\"/><ref name=\"riofunk.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908162256/http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-date=2006-09-08 |url-status=dead |title=RIOFUNK.org - INFORMATION ABOUT BAILE FUNK !!! |accessdate=2014-06-12 }}</ref>\n\nFunk Carioca is different from the funk originated in the United States. Starting in 1970, styles like ''bailes da pesada,'' ''black soul'', ''shaft'', and ''funk'' started to emerge in Rio de Janeiro. As time went on, DJ's started to look for other rhythms of black music, but the original name did not remain.  The term ''baile funk'' is used to refer to the parties in which Funk Carioca is played. Funk Carioca first emerged and is played throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, but not only in the city of Rio, like Rio natives like to believe. Funk Carioca is mostly appealing to the youth. In the decade of 1980, anthropologist Herman Vianna was the first social scientist to take Funk as an object to study in his Masters thesis, which gave origin to the book  ''O Mundo Funk Carioca'', which translates to ''The Carioca Funk World''(1988). During that decade, funk dances lost a bit of popularity due to the emergence of [[disco music]], a [[pop music|pop]] version of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]], especially after the release of the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) starring [[John Travolta]] and with soundtrack of the band [[Bee Gees]]. At the time, the then teenager, Fernando Lu\u00eds Mattos da Matta was interested in the discotheque when listening to the program Cidade Disco Club on Radio City of Rio de Janeiro (102.9 FM). Years later Fernando would adopt the nickname of [[DJ Marlboro]] and the radio would be known as the Rio \"[[rock music|rock]] radio\u201d.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nThere are a number of variants derived from funk carioca.\n\n=== Funk melody ===\n{{Main|Funk melody}}\nFunk Melody is based on Electro rhythms but with a romantic lyrical approach<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Medeiros | first1 = Jana\u00edna | title = Funk carioca: crime ou cultura? | publisher = Terceiro Nome | isbn = 9788587556745 | page = 19}} </ref>.

It contained three old-school funk carioca hits, including the song \"[[Popozuda Rock n' Roll]]\" by De Falla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Favela-Chic-Funk-Favela/release/1352224 |title=Various - Favela Chic: Funk Favela |publisher=discogs |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:M.i.a.1.jpg|thumb|200px|Artist [[M.I.A.

Berlin music journalist and DJ [[Daniel Haaksman]] released the seminal CD-compilations ''[[Rio Baile Funk Favela Booty Beats]]'' in 2004 and ''More Favela Booty Beats'' in 2006 through [[Essay Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.essayrecordings.com/cd_bailefunk.htm | title=Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty Beats | access-date=2008-12-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926140129/http://www.essayrecordings.com/cd_bailefunk.htm | archive-date=2008-09-26 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He launched the international career of [[Popozuda Rock n\u00b4Roll]] artist Edu K,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.manrecordings.com/man08.html | title = Edu K|publisher=Manrecordings.com|accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> whose baile funk anthem was used in a soft drink commercial in Germany. Haaksman continued to produce and distribute many new baile funk records, especially the [[Extended play|EP]] series \"Funk Mundial\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.manrecordings.com/man10.html | title = Funk Mundial}}</ref> and \"''Baile Funk Masters''\" on his label [[Man Recordings]].\n\nIn 2004, dance clubs from [[Eastern Europe]], mainly [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], increased the popularity of funk carioca due to the strong sexual appeal of the music and dance, also known as [[Bonde das Popozudas]]. Many funk carioca artists started to do shows abroad at that time. [[DJ Marlboro]] and [[Favela Chic Paris]] club were the pioneer travelers and producers. The funk carioca production was until then limited to playing in the [[ghetto]]s and the Brazilian pop market. DJ Marlboro,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.uol.com.br/bigmix/djmarlboro.html | title = \u00c9 BIG MIX O MAN\u00c9}}</ref> a major composer of funk carioca's tunes declared in 2006 in the Brazilian [[Istok (magazine)|Isto \u00c9 magazine]] how astonished he was with the sudden overseas interest in the genre. He would go on to travel in over 10 European countries.\n\nIn [[London]], duo [[Tetine]] assembled a compilation album called [[Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca]]'','' which was released by [[Mr Bongo Records]] in 2004. Tetine also ran the weekly radio show [[Slum Dunk]] on London's radio art station [[Resonance FM|Resonance Fm 104.4]]. Their radio show was entirely dedicated to funk carioca and worked as a platform for the duo to produce and organize a series of film programs as well as interviews and gigs involving funk carioca artists from Rio. Tetine were also responsible for the first screening of the [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] documentary [[Eu Sou Feia Mas T\u00f4 Na Moda]] by filmmaker [[Denise Garcia]] which was co-produced by Tetine in London and first shown in the city at the [[Slum Dunk Film Program]] at [[Brady Arts Centre]] in East London in March 2005. Apart from this, Tetine also produced two albums with experimental DIY [[queer]] funk carioca: ''[[Bonde do Tet\u00e3o]]'', released by Brazilian label [[Bizarre Records]] in 2004, and ''[[L.I.C.K My Favela]]'', released by [[Kute Bash Records]] in 2005. Tetine also recorded with [[Deize Tigrona]] on the track \"I Go to the Doctor\", included in the LP ''L.I.C.K My Favela'' in 2005 and later on their album ''[[Let Your X's Be Y's]]'', released by [[Soul Jazz Records]] in 2008.\n\nIn Italy, [[Irma Records]] released the 2005 compilation [[Colors Music#4: Rio Funk|Colors Music #4: Rio Funk]]. Many small labels (notably European label [[Arcade Mode]] and [[United States|American]] labels [[Flamin\u00b4Hotz]] and Nossa) labels released several compilations and EPs in bootleg formats.\n\nThe artist [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] brought mainstream international popularity to funk carioca with her single Bucky Done Gun released in 2005,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and brought attention to American DJ [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]], who had worked on M.I.A.'s 2004 mixtape [[Piracy Funds Terrorism]] on the tracks [[Baile Funk One]], [[Baile Funk Two]], and [[Baile Funk Three]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/MIA-Piracy-Funds-Terrorism-Volume-1/release/563747 |title=M.I.A. - Piracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1 |publisher=discogs |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref> [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]] made a bootleg mixtape, ''[[Favela on Blastin]]'', in 2004<ref name=\":0\" /> after [[Ivanna Bergese]] shared with him some compiled remix mixtapes of her performance act Yours Truly.

These generally focused on the social issues in the favelas. One of the most famous of these series of documentaries is [[Mr Catra the faithful]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rosforth.com/ |title=Andreas Rosforth Johnsen - Official website |publisher=Rosforth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103034018/http://rosforth.com/ |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (2005) by [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaker [[Andreas Rosforth Johnsen]], broadcast by many European open and cable television channels.\n\nLondon-based artist [[Sandra D'Angelo]] was the first Italian singer-producer to bring funk carioca to Italy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} She performed in London with [[Mc Gringo]] at [[Notting Hill Arts Club]] in 2008. She performed her baile funk productions for the contest ''Edison Change the Music'' in 2008. Sandra D'Angelo performed Baile Funk also in New York and produced tracks with [[EDU KA]] ([[Man Recordings]]) and DJ [[Amazing Clay]] from Rio.\n\nIn 2008, Berlin label Man Recordings released ''Gring\u00e3o'', the debut album by German [[MC Gringo]] \u2014 the only non-Brazilian MC performing in the bailes of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nEnglish indie pop band [[Everything Everything]] claim the drum patterns used on their Top 40 single [[Cough Cough]] were inspired by those used on [[Major Lazer]]'s [[Pon de Floor]], a funk carioca song.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn Brazil, funk carioca lyrics are often criticized due to their violent and sexually explicit lyrics, as well as [[misogynist]]ic content. The [[Sexism|degradation of women]] as objects for sex is a recurring theme in funk carioca. Girls are called \"cachorras\" (whores) and \"popozudas\" - large buttocks, and many songs revolve around casual and degrading sex practices with them. \"Novinhas\" (young/underaged girls) as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] are also a frequent theme in funk carioca songs.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-zq-sspQo |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Some of these songs, however, are sung by women.\n\nThe extreme banalization of sex and the incitement of [[promiscuity]] is viewed as a negative aspect of the funk carioca culture. Besides the moral considerations, in favelas, where sanitary conditions are poor and [[sex education]] low, this might lead to [[public health]] and social issues. In such communities, definitive [[Birth control|contraceptive methods]] are hardly available and due to lack of education and awareness, [[family planning]] is close to nonexistent. This environment results in unwanted pregnancies, population overgrowth, and eventually the growth of the communities ([[faveliza\u00e7\u00e3o]]).<ref name=\"www1.folha.uol.com.br\">{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u128489.shtml |title=Folha Online - Cotidiano - Atlas aponta natalidade maior que a m\u00e9dia em favelas da Grande SP - 22/11/2006 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref><ref name=\"rjtv.globo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://rjtv.globo.com/Jornalismo/RJTV/0,,MUL131124-9097,00.html |title=G1 \u2013 Rio de Janeiro: not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos da Globo |publisher=Rjtv.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Glamour (presentation)|glamor]]ization of [[criminality]] in the favelas is also frequently viewed as another negative consequence of funk carioca. Some funk songs, belonging to a style known as \"proibid\u00e3o\" (\"the forbidden\"), have very violent lyrics and are sometimes composed by drug-dealing gangs. Its themes include praising the murders of rival gang members and cops, intimidating opposers, claiming power over the favelas, robbery, drug use and the illicit life of drug dealers in general. Authorities view some of these lyrics as \"recruiting\" people to organized crime and inciting violence, and playing some of these songs are thus considered a crime.<ref name=\"osmelhoresvideos.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osmelhoresvideos.net/video/1614/proibidoes-nos-bailes-funks-das-favelas-do-rio-de-janeiro.html |title=V\u00eddeo \u00bb Proibid\u00f5es nos bailes funks das favelas do Rio de janeiro |publisher=OsMelhoresVideos.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of regulation and the locations where they usually take place, \"[[bailes funk]]\" are also very crime prone environments. They are popular hot spots for drug trade and consumption, dealers display power frequenting the parties heavily armed,<ref name=\"g1.globo.com\">{{cite web|author=Carolina Lauriano Do G1, no Rio |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1541216-5606,00-VAGNER+LOVE+NEGA+CONHECER+HOMENS+QUE+APARECEM+ARMADOS+EM+VIDEO.html |title=G1 > Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro - NOT\u00cdCIAS - Vagner Love nega conhecer homens que aparecem armados em v\u00eddeo |publisher=G1.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> and even murder rates are high.<ref name=\"busca2.globo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://busca2.globo.com/Busca/g1/?query=morte+baile+funk&ordenacao=&offset=1&xargs=&formato=&requisitor=g1&aba=todos&filtro=&on=false&formatos= |title=G1 - O Portal de Not\u00edcias da Globo - BUSCA |publisher=Busca2.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nMore popular funk carioca artists usually compose two different sets of similar lyrics for their songs: one gentler, more \"appropriate\" version, and another with a harsher, cruder set of lyrics (not unlike the concept of \"clean\" and \"explicit\" versions of songs). The first version is the one broadcast by local radio stations; the second is played in dance halls, parties, and in public by sound cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sansone, Livio. \"The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio.\" Brazilian Popular Music & Globalization, 139. London: Routledge, 2002</ref> Recurrent lyric topics in funk carioca are explicit sexual positions, the funk party, the police force, and the life of slum dwellers in the [[favela]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Artists |first=Various |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4765058 |title=The Sound of Brazil's Funk Carioca: NPR Music |publisher=Npr.org |date=2005-07-21 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref> Another large part of the lyrics is the use of the world around them - mainly the poverty that has enveloped the area. This is usually denounced in the lyrics and the hope for a better life is carried through many of their messages.<ref name=\"riofunk.org\"/>\n\nWith its recent success in Europe, it has also been criticized that Brazil is exporting music that is much inferior when compared to the [[bossa nova]] of the 1950s/60s and the [[Brazilian rock]] that had been made famous in the 1980s. It has been rumored that most of the funk projects in favelas are also financially backed by drug lords, so many song lyrics deal with challenging the police together with a subversive nature to the law currently established in Brazil.\n\n===Response===\nDefenders of funk carioca argue that the genre is an authentic expression of the culture of [[Afro-Brazilian]] communities, and the lyrics of a sexual nature reflect the sexual freedom found in Brazilian society.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Surra de Bunda]]\n* [[Miami bass]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1569728,00.html \"Ghetto Fabulous\" Observer Music Monthly article on Baile Funk by Alex Bellos 2005]\n* [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1166677,00.html \"Samba, That's So Last Year\" article by Alex Bellos at The Guardian 2004]\n* [http://www.thefreeradical.ca/in_the_fight_clubs_of_rio_monday.htm \"In The Fight Club Of Rio\" article on \"corridor balls\" at Free Radical by Canadian Nicole Veash 2000]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602043605/http://musibrasil.net/articolo.php?id=1915 Article with Baile Funk master Sany Pitbull by Sabrina Fidalgo at Musibrasil 2007]\n* [https://xlr8r.com/features/the-funk-phenomenon/ \"The Funk Phenomenon\" article by Bruno Natal at XLR8R magazine 2005]\n* [http://www.proibidao.org/funk-carioca-and-musica-soul/ ''Funk Carioca'' and ''M\u00fasica Soul'' by Carlos Palombini]\n{{Hip Hop}}\n{{Lusophonemusic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Funk Carioca}}\n[[Category:Brazilian styles of music]]\n[[Category:Funk carioca| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:sampler\u2192sampler (musical instrument),electronic\u2192electronic music", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_carioca"}

She and her best friend Maimouna hustle for money, shoplifting from supermarkets and then reselling their wares on the streets to their classmates. The two girls have a secret hiding place in the catwalk of a local theatre where they observe dance auditions. Djigui, an untrained dancer, catches Dounia's eye. One day, Maimouna dares Dounia to spit on him and she does, resulting in him trying to chase her down. He ends up slipping and Dounia rescues him by pulling him up from the catwalk.\n\nAt school, Dounia is expected to be trained as a receptionist. She rebels against her teacher, ridiculing her for her lack of money and vowing to earn more money than her teacher could ever dream of. Rebecca, a local drug dealer, shows the kids video from a trip to [[Thailand]] and plans to move there for the growing sex tourism. Determined to be part of Rebecca's gang, Dounia observes her giving drugs to a dealer, Samir. She steals the drugs from a hiding spot and brings them to Rebecca, telling her that she would do a better job as a dealer. Impressed, Rebecca agrees to let Dounia start working for her.\n\nRebecca gives Dounia and Maimouna a series of odd jobs which they successfully complete, working up the ranks from chores to dealing drugs. Rebecca confides in the two that a rich man, Reda, keeps 100,000 [[euro]]s in his apartment, and plans for Dounia to steal it. Dounia continues to hide her money in the theatre but when it is gone she confronts Djigui, who refuses to give it back.\n\nSamir drives Dounia and Maimouna go to a nightclub and succeed in getting the mark to notice Dounia. When they leave, they find that Samir has left; when she gets home, Dounia finds Samir having sex with her mother. She scolds her mother, then burns Samir's mother's car. When the firefighters show up Dounia throws glass bottles at them and starts a riot, leading her to be arrested. At the station, Maimouna and Dounia are loudly berated by Maimouna's devout [[Islam|Muslim]] parents and an angry Rebecca scolds Dounia for getting in trouble with the police.\n\nDounia goes to Djigui to get her money back in order to gain back Rebecca's favor. Djigui tells her he has been hired as the principal dancer in the show and gives her tickets to watch him perform, along with the money. Instead of going to see him, Dounia goes with Reda to a club. He takes her to his apartment and when he leaves to take a shower Dounia begins searching for his secret cache of money. She is discovered by Reda, who savagely beats her before attempting to rape her. Dounia fights back, knocking out Reda and then manages to locate the money. She leaves some of the money with her mother and hides some for Maimouna, intending to leave on a dance tour with Djigui.\n\nBefore she can go she receives a message from Rebecca who is holding Maimouna hostage until Dounia returns. Dounia brings the money to Rebecca, but she notices that some of it is missing and douses Dounia with gasoline, threatening to burn her. Before she can Samir realizes that the money is at her mother's home and leaves to go get it. Enraged, Dounia attacks Rebecca before she throws a lighter and the room they are in catches fire with them locked inside. Maimouna is able to open a vent but is unable to go through. Rebecca escapes and Maimouna urges Dounia to leave as her face is covered in gasoline. The money they were fighting over burns behind them. The firemen arrive in time, but wait outside as they are not allowed to fight fires in the neighbourhood anymore without the presence of riot police. Dounia begs them to save her friend, but they are unmoved, and the building explodes, killing Maimouna. An inconsolable Dounia watches a riot unfold as the police arrive.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Divines 2017 5.jpg|200px|thumb|Left to right: actress [[D\u00e9borah Lukumuena]], director [[Houda Benyamina]], and actress [[Oulaya Amamra]] attend the luncheon for the [[42nd C\u00e9sar Awards]].]]\n\n* [[Oulaya Amamra]] as Dounia\n* [[D\u00e9borah Lukumuena]] as Maimouna\n* K\u00e9vin Mischel as Djigui\n* Jisca Kalvanda as Rebecca\n* Yasin Houicha as Samir\n* Majdouline Idrissi as Myriam\n* Mounir Margoum as Cassandra\n* Farid Larbi as Reda\n\n==Awards and accolades== \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=6 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | List of accolades\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Award / Film Festival\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Date of Ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Result\n|-\n| [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-i-daniel-blake-wins-895315 |quote=The Camera d\u2019Or, which honors the best first feature film, was awarded to ''Divines'', a movie by Houda Benyamina that premiered in Directors\u2019 Fortnight.

France|Romani]] [[banlieue]] on the outskirts of [[Paris]] with her mother and aunt. She and her best friend Maimouna hustle for money, shoplifting from supermarkets and then reselling their wares on the streets to their classmates. The two girls have a secret hiding place in the catwalk of a local theatre where they observe dance auditions. Djigui, an untrained dancer, catches Dounia's eye. One day, Maimouna dares Dounia to spit on him and she does, resulting in him trying to chase her down. He ends up slipping and Dounia rescues him by pulling him up from the catwalk.\n\nAt school, Dounia is expected to be trained as a receptionist. She rebels against her teacher, ridiculing her for her lack of money and vowing to earn more money than her teacher could ever dream of. Rebecca, a local drug dealer, shows the kids video from a trip to [[Thailand]] and plans to move there for the growing sex tourism. Determined to be part of Rebecca's gang, Dounia observes her giving drugs to a dealer, Samir. She steals the drugs from a hiding spot and brings them to Rebecca, telling her that she would do a better job as a dealer. Impressed, Rebecca agrees to let Dounia start working for her.\n\nRebecca gives Dounia and Maimouna a series of odd jobs which they successfully complete, working up the ranks from chores to dealing drugs. Rebecca confides in the two that a rich man, Reda, keeps 100,000 [[euro]]s in his apartment, and plans for Dounia to steal it. Dounia continues to hide her money in the theatre but when it is gone she confronts Djigui, who refuses to give it back.\n\nSamir drives Dounia and Maimouna go to a nightclub and succeed in getting the mark to notice Dounia. When they leave, they find that Samir has left; when she gets home, Dounia finds Samir having sex with her mother. She scolds her mother, then burns Samir's mother's car. When the firefighters show up Dounia throws glass bottles at them and starts a riot, leading her to be arrested. At the station, Maimouna and Dounia are loudly berated by Maimouna's devout [[Islam|Muslim]] parents and an angry Rebecca scolds Dounia for getting in trouble with the police.\n\nDounia goes to Djigui to get her money back in order to gain back Rebecca's favor. Djigui tells her he has been hired as the principal dancer in the show and gives her tickets to watch him perform, along with the money. Instead of going to see him, Dounia goes with Reda to a club. He takes her to his apartment and when he leaves to take a shower Dounia begins searching for his secret cache of money. She is discovered by Reda, who savagely beats her before attempting to rape her. Dounia fights back, knocking out Reda and then manages to locate the money. She leaves some of the money with her mother and hides some for Maimouna, intending to leave on a dance tour with Djigui.\n\nBefore she can go she receives a message from Rebecca who is holding Maimouna hostage until Dounia returns. Dounia brings the money to Rebecca, but she notices that some of it is missing and douses Dounia with gasoline, threatening to burn her. Before she can Samir realizes that the money is at her mother's home and leaves to go get it. Enraged, Dounia attacks Rebecca before she throws a lighter and the room they are in catches fire with them locked inside. Maimouna is able to open a vent but is unable to go through. Rebecca escapes and Maimouna urges Dounia to leave as her face is covered in gasoline. The money they were fighting over burns behind them. The firemen arrive in time, but wait outside as they are not allowed to fight fires in the neighbourhood anymore without the presence of riot police. Dounia begs them to save her friend, but they are unmoved, and the building explodes, killing Maimouna. An inconsolable Dounia watches a riot unfold as the police arrive.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Divines 2017 5.jpg|200px|thumb|Left to right: actress [[D\u00e9borah Lukumuena]], director [[Houda Benyamina]], and actress [[Oulaya Amamra]] attend the luncheon for the [[42nd C\u00e9sar Awards]].]]\n\n* [[Oulaya Amamra]] as Dounia\n* [[D\u00e9borah Lukumuena]] as Maimouna\n* K\u00e9vin Mischel as Djigui\n* Jisca Kalvanda as Rebecca\n* Yasin Houicha as Samir\n* Majdouline Idrissi as Myriam\n* Mounir Margoum as Cassandra\n* Farid Larbi as Reda\n\n==Awards and accolades== \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=6 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | List of accolades\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Award / Film Festival\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Date of Ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Result\n|-\n| [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-i-daniel-blake-wins-895315 |quote=The Camera d\u2019Or, which honors the best first feature film, was awarded to ''Divines'', a movie by Houda Benyamina that premiered in Directors\u2019 Fortnight.

It is the oldest honourable Diploma (Degree) authorized from the European Faculties of Pharmacy as it takes four years to complete. It is based on a credit system higher than the normal Bachelor of Pharmacy degree (BPharm). It is different from the American Pharmaceutical Diploma, Doctor of Pharmacy,(PharmD), that takes six years to complete. The Faculty is a member of the Association of European Faculties of Pharmacy and its graduates meet all the requirements for the profession as defined by the European Union. In the initial three years students revise and broaden their knowledge of elementary natural and medical subjects to the level required for understanding specific subjects from the field of Pharmacy. Students attend lectures and seminars and take part in practical pharmacy placements. During the last year of study they work on their thesis. The programme is concluded by defending the thesis and taking the final state examination. Then the students are awarded the master's degree (abbreviated Mgr.). The study programme is compliant with EU directive 2005/36/EC.\nGraduates awarded the master's degree can later sit for a thorough state exam including an advanced thesis defence. After passing they are awarded the \"Testing Board\" degree (abbreviated EPhB).\nGraduates can apply for postgraduate after studying several branches of Pharmacy in the five accredited years. After defending their dissertation, submit their researches in their selected branches of Pharmacy and passing the final state examination they are awarded the degree.\nThe master's program is offered in different specialized areas, one major being Clinical Pharmacy. Clinical pharmacy specialization enables pharmacists to deliver higher levels of clinical services. In some countries these specializations are happening with residency programs.<ref name=\"Thomas_2019\">{{cite book| vauthors = Thomas D | url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=9Jp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Clinical+Pharmacy+Education,+Practice+and+Research&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXtvmywp7fAhWITBUIHXQaCcQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Clinical%20Pharmacy%20Education%2C%20Practice%20and%20Research&f=false |title=Clinical Pharmacy Education, Practice and Research | date = November 2018 | ISBN = 9780128142769}}</ref>\n\n== Finland ==\n\nIn [[Finland]], ''proviisori'' is an [[academic degree]] awarded after completing the post graduate programme in pharmacy.

The degree is awarded by all of the schools of pharmacy in the UK and superseded the BSc (Pharmacy) or [[BPharm]] degree when the length of the undergraduate pharmacy course was increased from three to four years in 1997\u2014partly due to EU harmonization of pharmacy training and partly to extend the scope of the undergraduate degree.\n\nThe MPharm is the only qualification in the UK which leads to professional registration as a pharmacist. MPharm programs are accredited by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] (GPhC) in England, Scotland and Wales, and [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) in Northern Ireland.\nAspiring pharmacists in the UK qualify by first completing this degree, then undertaking a year of pre-registration training. On successful completion of this training, and after passing the pre-registration exam, they become registered pharmacists. In [[Great Britain]] it used to be the case, until September 2010, that with registration they became members of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], able to use the postnominal letters ''MRPharmS'' (Member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain). However, the RPS split off its regulatory role in September 2010 and the new regulatory body, the GPhC, does not grant postnominals to its registrants.  MRPharmS is still granted by the RPS to its member but no longer has an automatic link to current registration as a pharmacist.  In Northern Ireland regulation has not been removed from the PSNI and therefore registration as a pharmacist and membership of the PSNI are still simultaneous, granting use of the postnominals ''MPSNI'' (Member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland).\n\n===Universities===\n<ref name=\"Gerens Curnow\">{{cite web|title=Accredited MPharm degrees|url=https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/education/pharmacist/accredited-mpharm-degrees|website=General Pharmaceutical Council|accessdate=21 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== India / Australia ==\nMaster of Pharmacy (MPharma) in India is offered as post graduate (graduate) course after completion of [[BPharma]] degree. The MPharma course is normally of two years duration. In some universities it is one-year research and one year theory examination, while some offers M Pharm by research completely leading to doctorate degree. The course focuses on specialisation in the field of pharmacy. The MPharma courses are offered by pharmacy colleges affiliated to unite leading to entry into the pharmacy profession. In 2004, the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] introduced a two-year postgraduate MPharm coursework program, to provide an alternative means to gain qualification for registration to practice as a pharmacist for graduates with a bachelor's degree in any science or medical science that includes the required prerequisites. The MPharm degree is not an advanced follow-up degree for pharmacists. Following the commencement of the MPharm program at the University of Newcastle, other universities across Australia also began offering MPharm coursework programs. At present, either the BPharm or MPharm degree is accepted for registration as a practicing pharmacist.\n\nSee [[List of pharmacy schools#Australia|list of pharmacy schools: Australia]] for a listing of institutions offering the MPharm degree.\n\n===MPharm (Clinical)/MClinPharm===\n\nWith the success and popularity of the MPharm coursework degrees, research MPharm degrees have now been redesignated '''Master of Pharmacy (Clinical)''' (abbreviated '''MPharm (Clinical)''') or  '''Master of Clinical Pharmacy''' (abbreviated '''MClinPharm''').

In the initial three years students revise and broaden their knowledge of elementary natural and medical subjects to the level required for understanding specific subjects from the field of Pharmacy. Students attend lectures and seminars and take part in practical pharmacy placements. During the last year of study they work on their thesis. The programme is concluded by defending the thesis and taking the final state examination. Then the students are awarded the master's degree (abbreviated Mgr.). The study programme is compliant with EU directive 2005/36/EC.\nGraduates awarded the master's degree can later sit for a thorough state exam including an advanced thesis defence. After passing they are awarded the \"Testing Board\" degree (abbreviated EPhB).\nGraduates can apply for postgraduate after studying several branches of Pharmacy in the five accredited years. After defending their dissertation, submit their researches in their selected branches of Pharmacy and passing the final state examination they are awarded the degree.\nThe master's program is offered in different specialized areas, one major being Clinical Pharmacy. Clinical pharmacy specialization enables pharmacists to deliver higher levels of clinical services. In some countries these specializations are happening with residency programs.<ref name=\"Thomas_2019\">{{cite book| vauthors = Thomas D | url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=9Jp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Clinical+Pharmacy+Education,+Practice+and+Research&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXtvmywp7fAhWITBUIHXQaCcQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Clinical%20Pharmacy%20Education%2C%20Practice%20and%20Research&f=false |title=Clinical Pharmacy Education, Practice and Research | date = November 2018 | ISBN = 9780128142769}}</ref>\n\n== Finland ==\n\nIn [[Finland]], ''proviisori'' is an [[academic degree]] awarded after completing the post graduate programme in pharmacy. The degree is equivalent to English term ''Master of Pharmacy''. Proviisori degree is required in order to be a druggist in Finland. Pharmacy is taught in [[University of Helsinki]] and [[University of Eastern Finland]].\n\n==Israel==\nStarting in 2017, the [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]] has begun offering a 2-year Master's program in Community Clinical Pharmacy and Regulatory Management.

The degree is awarded by all of the schools of pharmacy in the UK and superseded the BSc (Pharmacy) or [[BPharm]] degree when the length of the undergraduate pharmacy course was increased from three to four years in 1997\u2014partly due to EU harmonization of pharmacy training and partly to extend the scope of the undergraduate degree.\n\nThe MPharm is the only qualification in the UK which leads to professional registration as a pharmacist. MPharm programs are accredited by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] (GPhC) in England, Scotland and Wales, and [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) in Northern Ireland.\nAspiring pharmacists in the UK qualify by first completing this degree, then undertaking a year of pre-registration training. On successful completion of this training, and after passing the pre-registration exam, they become registered pharmacists. In [[Great Britain]] it used to be the case, until September 2010, that with registration they became members of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], able to use the postnominal letters ''MRPharmS'' (Member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain). However, the RPS split off its regulatory role in September 2010 and the new regulatory body, the GPhC, does not grant postnominals to its registrants.  MRPharmS is still granted by the RPS to its member but no longer has an automatic link to current registration as a pharmacist.  In Northern Ireland regulation has not been removed from the PSNI and therefore registration as a pharmacist and membership of the PSNI are still simultaneous, granting use of the postnominals ''MPSNI'' (Member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland).\n\n===Universities===\n<ref name=\"Gerens Curnow\">{{cite web|title=Accredited MPharm degrees|url=https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/education/pharmacist/accredited-mpharm-degrees|website=General Pharmaceutical Council|accessdate=21 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== India / Australia ==\nMaster of Pharmacy (MPharma) in India is offered as post graduate (graduate) course after completion of [[BPharma]] degree. The MPharma course is normally of two years duration. In some universities it is one-year research and one year theory examination, while some offers M Pharm by research completely leading to doctorate degree. The course focuses on specialisation in the field of pharmacy. The MPharma courses are offered by pharmacy colleges affiliated to unite leading to entry into the pharmacy profession. In 2004, the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] introduced a two-year postgraduate MPharm coursework program, to provide an alternative means to gain qualification for registration to practice as a pharmacist for graduates with a bachelor's degree in any science or medical science that includes the required prerequisites. The MPharm degree is not an advanced follow-up degree for pharmacists. Following the commencement of the MPharm program at the University of Newcastle, other universities across Australia also began offering MPharm coursework programs. At present, either the BPharm or MPharm degree is accepted for registration as a practicing pharmacist.\n\nSee [[List of pharmacy schools#Australia|list of pharmacy schools: Australia]] for a listing of institutions offering the MPharm degree.\n\n===MPharm (Clinical)/MClinPharm===\n\nWith the success and popularity of the MPharm coursework degrees, research MPharm degrees have now been redesignated '''Master of Pharmacy (Clinical)''' (abbreviated '''MPharm (Clinical)''') or  '''Master of Clinical Pharmacy''' (abbreviated '''MClinPharm'''). This degree offers advanced training to graduates of a Bachelor of Pharmacy, and does not by itself meet the requirements for registration as a pharmacist.\nThese are the following colleges imparting M Pharma in India in various specialties like Industrial Pharmacy, Bulk Drugs, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutics, Pharmacognosy, Pharmaceutical Biotechnology etc.:\n* Nalanda college of Pharmacy, [[Nalgonda]]\n* Gyani Inder Singh Institute of Professional Studies, [[Dehradun]]\n* J.S.S College of Pharmacy, Mysore/ Ootty\n* Pad.
