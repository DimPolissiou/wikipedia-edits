From a 13th-century manuscript of the ''[[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis]]'']]\n\nThe '''House of Godwin''' was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] (in later generations [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]] or Anglo-Norse) family, one of the leading noble families in England during the last 50 years before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].  Its most famous member was [[Harold Godwinson]], king of England for nine months in 1066.\n\nThe founder of the family's greatness, [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]], was raised from comparative obscurity by [[Cnut the Great|king Cnut]] and given the [[Earl of Wessex|earldom of Wessex]] around the year 1020.  He retained his position during the reigns of Cnut's sons [[Harold Harefoot]] and [[Harthacnut]], and consolidated it when king [[Edward the Confessor]] conferred earldoms on [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]] and Harold, Godwin's two eldest sons by his Danish wife, [[Gytha Thorkelsd\u00f3ttir|Gytha]].  The family survived a short-lived attempt by the king to exile them.  After Godwin's death his sons held the earldoms of Wessex, [[Earl of East Anglia|East Anglia]], and later [[Earl of Northumbria|Northumbria]]; Harold in particular became the most powerful man in England, eclipsing the power of the king.  When Edward the Confessor died childless in 1066 he was succeeded by Harold Godwinson.  Harold gained a great victory over the Norwegian invader [[Harald Hardrada]] and his own estranged brother [[Tostig Godwinson]] at the [[battle of Stamford Bridge]].  Three weeks later, with his defeat and death at the [[battle of Hastings]], Anglo-Saxon self-rule came to an end.  Later generations of the family were scattered around [[northern Europe]], one branch prospering in Norway and furnishing that country with one of its kings, [[Inge II of Norway|Inge II]], and a pretender to the throne, [[Skule B\u00e5rdsson]].  Through female lines the Godwin family are ancestors of most of the royal houses of modern Europe.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Main|Ancestry of the Godwins}}\n\n[[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], after whom the family is named, was the son of one Wulfnoth, probably to be identified with [[Wulfnoth Cild]],{{sfn|Williams|2004}}{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=417}} a [[Sussex]] [[thegn]] who in 1009, having been accused of unspecified crimes, deserted the service of the English king [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] along with a fleet of twenty ships.  Wulfnoth Cild may also have been father of [[\u00c6lfwig (abbot)|\u00c6lfwig]], abbot of [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]], who died at the [[battle of Hastings]], and of a daughter called \u00c6thelflaed; he is known to have died by 1014.{{sfn|Williams|2004}}{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p= 24}}  The writer Alfred Anscombe claimed a lineage for this Wulfnoth stretching back through [[\u00c6thelm\u00e6r the Stout]] and the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]] to king [[\u00c6thelred I, King of Wessex|\u00c6thelred I]] of [[Wessex]], which would make the house of Godwin a branch of the [[House of Wessex|house of Cerdic]], but most historians are sceptical of this theory and treat Wulfnoth's ancestry as unknown.{{sfn|Mason|2004|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=417}}{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=25}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rex |first1=Peter |title=Harold II: The Doomed Saxon King |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AgnENwAACAAJ |year=2005 |isbn=0752435299 |page=21 |access-date=9 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Godwin under the Danish kings ==\n{{Main|Godwin, Earl of Wessex}}\n\nThe date of Godwin's birth is estimated to have been around the year 993.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=27}}  He first appears in history as an adherent of [[\u00c6thelstan \u00c6theling]], the eldest son of \u00c6thelred the Unready, and when that prince died in 1014 he left Godwin an estate.  Godwin is surmised to have then given his allegiance to Athelstan's brother [[Edmund Ironside]] during the short remainder of \u00c6thelred's life and Edmund's own brief reign, and to have supported him in his campaigns against the invading Danish king [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]].{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=4\u20137}}  With Edmund's death in 1016 and Cnut's acquisition of the English crown Godwin seems to have made his peace with the new king.  He survived Cnut's purge of English nobles, and indeed prospered, being made earl first of the eastern part of Wessex and then, perhaps in 1020, of the whole province.  He also about 1022 married [[Gytha Thorkelsd\u00f3ttir|Gytha]], sister of the Danish earl [[Ulf the Earl|Ulf]], who was himself Cnut's brother-in-law.{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Williams|2004}}  He was, by 1023, considered the leading magnate in Cnut's English kingdom, loyally supporting Cnut and implicitly trusted by him.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp=38\u201339}}  When Cnut died in 1035 the succession was disputed between Cnut's two sons [[Harthacnut]] and [[Harold Harefoot]]; Godwin was one of Harthacnut's most influential supporters, but Harold ultimately prevailed.  In 1036 another of \u00c6thelred's sons, [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]], made an expedition to England, where he fell into the hands first of Godwin and then of Harold Harefoot, who had him blinded.  Alfred did not survive this operation, but it is unclear whether this was a deliberate execution on Harold's part, and still more unclear how much responsibility, if any, attaches to Godwin.  Nevertheless, a cloud of suspicion hung over him for the rest of his life, and when, in 1040, Harold died, the new king, Harthacnut, exacted an oath from Godwin that he had been innocent of everything except obeying Harold's orders.{{sfn|Williams|2004}}\n\n== Godwin's rivalry with Edward the Confessor ==\n[[File:Edithof Wessex.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwin]]'s daughter [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]], from a 13th-century manuscript of the ''[[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis]]'']]\n\nIn 1042 Harthacnut died, and was succeeded, with Godwin's hefty support, by [[Edward the Confessor]], brother of the unfortunate Alfred.  Godwin by now had a large family, six sons and three daughters, and the elder sons were becoming old enough to take on responsibilities of their own, while Edward needed to reward the man who had, more than any other, secured him the crown.  [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]] is usually accounted Godwin's eldest son, though the monk [[Hemming (monk)|Hemming]] reported him as believing his real father had been Cnut; in 1043 he was given an earldom consisting of [[Somerset]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Berkshire]].  Godwin's second son, [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]], was made [[earl of East Anglia]] the following year.  In 1045 [[Beorn Estrithson]], Godwin's wife's nephew, was given an earldom in the east Midlands, and the same year the seal was set on the family's grasp of power when Godwin's eldest daughter, [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]], married king Edward.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp=22, 33, 43\u201345, 47\u201349}}{{sfn|Williams|2004}}  The Godwin family now held four English earldoms, only [[Earl of Mercia|Mercia]] and [[Earl of Northumbria|Northumbria]] remaining in other hands, and had their representative even in the king's bedchamber.{{sfn|Barlow|1997|pp=89\u201390}}  By contrast, Edward's personal estate, though very large, was probably smaller than that held by his ancestors, and was scattered between various earldoms, meaning that he had no local power base; moreover he had only recently returned to England as a half-Norman stranger with no experience of English politics or of any kind of leadership.  A struggle for power between king and earl now began.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\nThe first setback for the Godwin family stemmed from Sweyn's wild and irresponsible conduct.  He first allied himself with [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], who might be considered a natural enemy of the English, and launched with him a joint expedition into south Wales.  On his return he either seduced or abducted the [[Leominster Abbey|abbess of Leominster]] and kept her as his wife for a year, a scandal which resulted in his being outlawed by the king.  Sweyn's lands were divided between his brother Harold and cousin Beorn, while he himself moved on first to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and then to Denmark.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp=52\u201353}}  Two years later, in 1049, he returned intending to regain his lands, but instead murdered Beorn.  He was again outlawed and returned to Flanders, but the king allowed him to return in 1050.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=26831 |title=Swein [Sweyn], earl |last=Williams |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Williams (historian) |date=23 September 2004}}</ref>  Despite his leniency in this matter, Edward was beginning to move against the Godwin family.  He gave the murdered Beorn's earldom to his own nephew [[Ralph the Timid]] rather than to anyone allied to Godwin; he countermanded the election to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishopric of Canterbury]] of Godwin's kinsman [[\u00c6lric (Archbishop-elect of Canterbury)|\u00c6lric]], substituting instead [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]], an enemy of the Godwin clan; and he allowed a small number of castles to be built, or at least planned, by various of his foreign favourites in the earldoms held by Godwin and his sons.{{sfn|Williams|2004}}  \n\nMatters came to a head in 1051 when the men of [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace, Count of Boulogne]], who was passing through [[Dover]], got involved in a fight with the townspeople.  King Edward decided that Dover should be harried as a punishment, and ordered Godwin, within whose earldom Dover lay, to carry out the sentence.  Godwin refused, and prepared for the king's displeasure.  He and his sons gathered an army, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria assembled their men in defence of the king, and the result was a stalemate in which neither side wanted to attack the other.  It was agreed that a meeting of the ''[[Witenagemot|witan]]'' would resolve the dispute, but when the king called up the English [[Fyrd|militia]] Godwin's side found themselves outnumbered there.  The result was that the whole family was banished.  Godwin, his wife, and their sons Sweyn, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] and [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]] fled to [[Bruges]] in Flanders, and Harold and his brother [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] to Ireland, while their sister queen Edith was sent to a nunnery.  The following year, 1052, Godwin and Harold both launched small fleets, joined up off the south-west coast of England, then recruited support from the ports of Sussex and [[Kent]].  This combined and augmented fleet sailed to London, where Godwin forced a new settlement of his differences with the king, entirely in his own favour.  His and his family's earldoms were restored to them, the queen was recalled, and most of the king's numerous French favourites were outlawed.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=562\u2013568}}  So firmly had the family regained its grip on power that Edward never again tried his strength against them.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}  But Godwin did not enjoy his triumph long.  In 1053, while celebrating Easter at [[Winchester]] along with some of his sons and the king, he suddenly collapsed and after a few days died.  In the following century chroniclers embroidered the story with details suggesting that this was divine retribution; in the fullest form of the legend he takes a mouthful of bread, praying that he may not be allowed to swallow it if he was guilty of murdering the king's brother Alfred, then chokes and dies.{{sfn|Mason|2004|pp=79\u201381}}\n\n== Godwin's sons ==\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry (Harold).jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Harold Godwinson]], from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nGodwin's second son, Harold, succeeded him in the earldom of Wessex, while Harold's old earldom of East Anglia was taken by [[\u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia|\u00c6lfgar]], son of the earl of Mercia.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}  Godwin's eldest son, Sweyn, could not be considered for any title since he had gone on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and indeed was to die in September 1052 on the return journey.{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=50}}  Over the next few years one earldom after another fell vacant and was granted to Harold's various younger brothers.  First [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Siward, earl of Northumbria]], died in 1055 and was succeeded by Tostig.{{sfn|Aird|2004}}  Then in 1057 the earl of Mercia died and was succeeded by his son \u00c6lfgar, freeing up East Anglia; a reduced form of this earldom was bestowed on Gyrth, while the counties of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Middlesex]], [[Surrey]] and Kent were formed into a new earldom for Leofwine.  The same year king Edward's nephew Ralph the Timid died, and his earldom of Hereford was added to Harold's Wessex.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=574}}  The Godwin family thus held the whole of England apart from Mercia under the kingship of Edward the Confessor, who was by now largely content to leave effective rule to his earls.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}  \n\nIn 1063 Harold launched a cavalry raid intended to kill Gruffydd ap Llewelyn, who since 1055 had been ruling the whole of Wales, but it failed in its objective.  He returned to the attack the same year along with his brother Tostig in a joint invasion of Wales, using both land and naval forces, which wreaked such destruction that Gruffydd's own men killed him and sent his head to Harold.{{sfn|Barlow|1997|pp=205\u2013211}}  \n\nNot long afterwards, probably in 1064, Harold is thought to have set out on a voyage in the [[English Channel]] and been blown by a storm onto the coast of [[Ponthieu]], whose count delivered him into the hands of [[William the Conqueror|William the Bastard]], [[Duke of Normandy]].  It is not known what the purpose of Harold's journey was.  Norman writers later alleged that he had been sent by king Edward to confirm William as heir to the English throne and to swear fealty to him, but his biographer Ian W. Walker considers the most likely possibilities to be, firstly, that he was seeking a marriage alliance between his family and William's; secondly, that he wanted to negotiate the release of his youngest brother [[Wulfnoth Godwinson|Wulfnoth]] and Sweyn's son [[Hakon Sweynson|Hakon]], who had long been held hostage in Normandy; and thirdly, that he was bound elsewhere for reasons unknown.  Harold accompanied William on a campaign against [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], and then was coerced into swearing an oath that he would support William's claim to be Edward's heir.  Finally, he was allowed to return home.{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=103\u2013116}}\n\nTostig's record as earl of Northumbria was a mixed one.  In external affairs he was rather successful, forming a friendship with the king of Scotland which largely prevented trouble on his northern border, and leading a legation to Rome on Edward's behalf.  But inside his earldom his over-harsh measures to keep the king's peace made him unpopular with his own nobles.{{sfn|Barlow|2003|pp=87\u201390}}  In 1065, while Tostig was at king Edward's court in the south of England, they revolted against him, murdered his men, and demanded his banishment.  Harold, unwilling to provoke a civil war, refused to invade Northumbria to reinstate him, and king Edward reluctantly acceded to the rebels' demands and exiled Tostig.  Furious at his brother's failure to support him, Tostig left for Flanders, and there is evidence that he visited William of Normandy, king [[Sweyn II of Denmark]], and king [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway, in an attempt to find allies who could return him to power.{{sfn|Aird|2004}}  The earldom of Northumbria was given to [[Morcar]], brother of the Mercian earl [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]], and Harold allied himself to the brothers by marrying their sister [[Ealdgyth (daughter of \u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia)|Ealdgyth]].  At the beginning of 1066 Edward the Confessor died childless, after having apparently named Harold as his heir.  The ''witan'', preferring the claims of Harold to those of the late king's great-nephew, the boy [[Edgar \u00c6theling]], elected him as king, and he was crowned the day after Edward's death.  His reign was to last just nine months, and, as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' says, \"he met little quiet in it as long as he ruled the realm\".{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}\n\n== Harold II ==\n{{Main|Harold Godwinson}}\n[[File:Penny of Harold Godwinson.png|thumb|A penny of king [[Harold Godwinson]]]]\n\nHarold faced threats from the duke of Normandy, from the king of Norway, and from possible Welsh raiders, but the first to act was his own brother Tostig, who in the spring of 1066 launched raids on the [[Isle of Wight]] and various points on the east coast of England before suffering a severe defeat in [[Lincolnshire]] and taking refuge in Scotland.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}{{sfn|Douglas|1999|p=190}}  Harold, expecting an invasion by William of Normandy, moved to the south coast to prepare his defences, but on 8 September, unable to provision his forces any longer, he was compelled to disband them.{{sfn|Douglas|1999|pp=191\u2013192}}  The same month, Harald Hardrada set out from Norway on his attempt to take the English crown, sailing via [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]] and joining up with Tostig at the [[river Tyne]], where the latter took service under him as one of his earls.<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=49272 |title=Harald Hardrada [Haraldr inn Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i, Haraldr Sigur\u00f0arson] |last=Krag |first=Claus |date=25 May 2006}}</ref>  Together they engaged a Northumbrian army at [[Fulford, North Yorkshire|Fulford]] in [[Yorkshire]], gained a complete victory, and took the city of [[York]].  Harold Godwinson hurriedly recalled his army and by forced marches was able to surprise Harald and Tostig's army at [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]] on 25 September, only five days after the [[battle of Fulford]], and inflicted a crushing defeat on them.{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=177\u2013186}}  He allowed the few survivors, including Tostig's sons Skule and Ketel, to return in peace to Norway.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=138}}  Three days later duke William landed his invasion fleet at [[Pevensey]] in Sussex, then moved on to [[Hastings]] and began to ravage the Sussex countryside, part of Harold's old earldom of Wessex.  This achieved its intended effect of provoking Harold to march south with all speed.  On 14 October the two armies met seven miles north of Hastings, where the town of [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] now stands.  Harold, accompanied by his brothers Gyrth and Leofwine, commanded an army that was now badly overtired and proved unable to withstand the [[Battle of Hastings|repeated Norman attacks]].  By the end of the day Harold's army was comprehensively defeated, all three brothers were dead, and the ruin of Anglo-Saxon England was accomplished.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=29448 |title=William I [known as William the Conqueror] |last=Bates |first=David |date=19 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n== The family disperses ==\n\nOnly two members of the family were allowed to live undisturbed in England under Norman rule.  Edward the Confessor's widow Edith, daughter of Godwin, lived in retirement, remaining in possession of all her private lands, until her death in 1075.  She was buried near her husband in [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp. 160\u2013161}}  Her niece [[Gunhild of Wessex|Gunhild]], daughter of Harold Godwinson, was an inmate of [[Wilton Abbey|the nunnery]] in [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] until 1093, when she was abducted by [[Alan Rufus|Alan the Red]], a Breton who held the lordship of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]].

Two of the sons, probably Godwin and Edmund, survived to join their relatives in Saint-Omer.  From there the whole party seems to have proceeded to Denmark in the hope that its king, Sweyn II, would help them regain their position in England.  Sweyn failed them in this, but after a few years he arranged an advantageous marriage for the younger Gytha with [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]], [[Prince of Smolensk]] and later [[Grand Prince of Kiev]].

Olaf, who became king of Norway, gave land to Ketel and arranged a good marriage for him; according to the 13th-century saga-writer [[Snorri Sturluson]], \"from him are descended many great people\".  Skule became known as Skule Kongsfostre (king's foster-son), and was remembered as a remarkably intelligent and handsome man who commanded the king's [[hird]].  He married a relative of the king, Gudrun Nevsteinsdotter, and their son was \u00c5solv of Rein (in [[Rissa, Norway|Rissa]]), father of the [[lendmann]] Guttorm of Rein.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=168}}{{sfn|Snorri Sturluson|1951|pp=237\u2013238}}{{sfn|Bj\u00f8rgo|2009a}}  Guttorm's son, B\u00e5rd Guttormsson of Rein, was a close friend and supporter of king [[Sverre of Norway|Sverre Sigurdsson]], fought alongside him in several battles, and was rewarded by being given the king's half-sister, [[Cecilia Sigurdsdotter]], in marriage.{{sfn|Bj\u00f8rgo|2009a}}  B\u00e5rd and Cecilia's son [[Inge II of Norway|Inge B\u00e5rdsson]] was born about the year 1185.

After a struggle for power Inge was recognized as king, while Haakon retained his former command of the army.  This did not produce peace, for a faction known as the ''[[Bagler]]'' succeeded in splitting the kingdom, with Inge ruling the western half and their own candidate, [[Philip Simonsson]], the eastern half.  Moreover, earl Haakon renewed his own claim to the crown, a claim which only lapsed with his death in 1214.  King Inge himself died in 1217.{{sfn|Helte|2009}}  Since 1213 the leader of the army and the hird had been Inge's half-brother [[Skule B\u00e5rdsson|Skule]], a son of B\u00e5rd Guttormsson by another wife, Ragnfrid Erlingsdotter, and therefore, like king Inge, fifth in descent in the male line from Tostig Godwinson.

In 1225 Skule married his young daughter, [[Margrete Skulesdatter|Margrete]], to the king, but this did not succeed in establishing perfect amity between the two men, and in 1239 Skule went into open rebellion, claiming the title of king for himself.

From a 13th-century manuscript of the ''[[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis]]'']]\n\nThe '''House of Godwin''' was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] (in later generations [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]] or Anglo-Norse) family, one of the leading noble families in England during the last 50 years before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].  Its most famous member was [[Harold Godwinson]], king of England for nine months in 1066.\n\nThe founder of the family's greatness, [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]], was raised from comparative obscurity by [[Cnut the Great|king Cnut]] and given the [[Earl of Wessex|earldom of Wessex]] around the year 1020.  He retained his position during the reigns of Cnut's sons [[Harold Harefoot]] and [[Harthacnut]], and consolidated it when king [[Edward the Confessor]] conferred earldoms on [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]] and Harold, Godwin's two eldest sons by his Danish wife, [[Gytha Thorkelsd\u00f3ttir|Gytha]].  The family survived a short-lived attempt by the king to exile them.  After Godwin's death his sons held the earldoms of Wessex, [[Earl of East Anglia|East Anglia]], and later [[Earl of Northumbria|Northumbria]]; Harold in particular became the most powerful man in England, eclipsing the power of the king.  When Edward the Confessor died childless in 1066 he was succeeded by Harold Godwinson.  Harold gained a great victory over the Norwegian invader [[Harald Hardrada]] and his own estranged brother [[Tostig Godwinson]] at the [[battle of Stamford Bridge]].  Three weeks later, with his defeat and death at the [[battle of Hastings]], Anglo-Saxon self-rule came to an end.  Later generations of the family were scattered around [[northern Europe]], one branch prospering in Norway and furnishing that country with one of its kings, [[Inge II of Norway|Inge II]], and a pretender to the throne, [[Skule B\u00e5rdsson]].  Through female lines the Godwin family are ancestors of most of the royal houses of modern Europe.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Main|Ancestry of the Godwins}}\n\n[[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], after whom the family is named, was the son of one Wulfnoth, probably to be identified with [[Wulfnoth Cild]],{{sfn|Williams|2004}}{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=417}} a [[Sussex]] [[thegn]] who in 1009, having been accused of unspecified crimes, deserted the service of the English king [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] along with a fleet of twenty ships.  Wulfnoth Cild may also have been father of [[\u00c6lfwig (abbot)|\u00c6lfwig]], abbot of [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]], who died at the [[battle of Hastings]], and of a daughter called \u00c6thelflaed; he is known to have died by 1014.{{sfn|Williams|2004}}{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p= 24}}  The writer Alfred Anscombe claimed a lineage for this Wulfnoth stretching back through [[\u00c6thelm\u00e6r the Stout]] and the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]] to king [[\u00c6thelred I, King of Wessex|\u00c6thelred I]] of [[Wessex]], which would make the house of Godwin a branch of the [[House of Wessex|house of Cerdic]], but most historians are sceptical of this theory and treat Wulfnoth's ancestry as unknown.{{sfn|Mason|2004|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=417}}{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=25}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rex |first1=Peter |title=Harold II: The Doomed Saxon King |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AgnENwAACAAJ |year=2005 |isbn=0752435299 |page=21 |access-date=9 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Godwin under the Danish kings ==\n{{Main|Godwin, Earl of Wessex}}\n\nThe date of Godwin's birth is estimated to have been around the year 993.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=27}}  He first appears in history as an adherent of [[\u00c6thelstan \u00c6theling]], the eldest son of \u00c6thelred the Unready, and when that prince died in 1014 he left Godwin an estate.  Godwin is surmised to have then given his allegiance to Athelstan's brother [[Edmund Ironside]] during the short remainder of \u00c6thelred's life and Edmund's own brief reign, and to have supported him in his campaigns against the invading Danish king [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]].{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=4\u20137}}  With Edmund's death in 1016 and Cnut's acquisition of the English crown Godwin seems to have made his peace with the new king.  He survived Cnut's purge of English nobles, and indeed prospered, being made earl first of the eastern part of Wessex and then, perhaps in 1020, of the whole province.  He also about 1022 married [[Gytha Thorkelsd\u00f3ttir|Gytha]], sister of the Danish earl [[Ulf the Earl|Ulf]], who was himself Cnut's brother-in-law.{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Williams|2004}}  He was, by 1023, considered the leading magnate in Cnut's English kingdom, loyally supporting Cnut and implicitly trusted by him.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp=38\u201339}}  When Cnut died in 1035 the succession was disputed between Cnut's two sons [[Harthacnut]] and [[Harold Harefoot]]; Godwin was one of Harthacnut's most influential supporters, but Harold ultimately prevailed.  In 1036 another of \u00c6thelred's sons, [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]], made an expedition to England, where he fell into the hands first of Godwin and then of Harold Harefoot, who had him blinded.  Alfred did not survive this operation, but it is unclear whether this was a deliberate execution on Harold's part, and still more unclear how much responsibility, if any, attaches to Godwin.  Nevertheless, a cloud of suspicion hung over him for the rest of his life, and when, in 1040, Harold died, the new king, Harthacnut, exacted an oath from Godwin that he had been innocent of everything except obeying Harold's orders.{{sfn|Williams|2004}}\n\n== Godwin's rivalry with Edward the Confessor ==\n[[File:Edithof Wessex.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwin]]'s daughter [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]], from a 13th-century manuscript of the ''[[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis]]'']]\n\nIn 1042 Harthacnut died, and was succeeded, with Godwin's hefty support, by [[Edward the Confessor]], brother of the unfortunate Alfred.  Godwin by now had a large family, six sons and three daughters, and the elder sons were becoming old enough to take on responsibilities of their own, while Edward needed to reward the man who had, more than any other, secured him the crown.  [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]] is usually accounted Godwin's eldest son, though the monk [[Hemming (monk)|Hemming]] reported him as believing his real father had been Cnut; in 1043 he was given an earldom consisting of [[Somerset]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Berkshire]].  Godwin's second son, [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]], was made [[earl of East Anglia]] the following year.  In 1045 [[Beorn Estrithson]], Godwin's wife's nephew, was given an earldom in the east Midlands, and the same year the seal was set on the family's grasp of power when Godwin's eldest daughter, [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]], married king Edward.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp=22, 33, 43\u201345, 47\u201349}}{{sfn|Williams|2004}}  The Godwin family now held four English earldoms, only [[Earl of Mercia|Mercia]] and [[Earl of Northumbria|Northumbria]] remaining in other hands, and had their representative even in the king's bedchamber.{{sfn|Barlow|1997|pp=89\u201390}}  By contrast, Edward's personal estate, though very large, was probably smaller than that held by his ancestors, and was scattered between various earldoms, meaning that he had no local power base; moreover he had only recently returned to England as a half-Norman stranger with no experience of English politics or of any kind of leadership.  A struggle for power between king and earl now began.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\nThe first setback for the Godwin family stemmed from Sweyn's wild and irresponsible conduct.  He first allied himself with [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], who might be considered a natural enemy of the English, and launched with him a joint expedition into south Wales.  On his return he either seduced or abducted the [[Leominster Abbey|abbess of Leominster]] and kept her as his wife for a year, a scandal which resulted in his being outlawed by the king.  Sweyn's lands were divided between his brother Harold and cousin Beorn, while he himself moved on first to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and then to Denmark.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp=52\u201353}}  Two years later, in 1049, he returned intending to regain his lands, but instead murdered Beorn.  He was again outlawed and returned to Flanders, but the king allowed him to return in 1050.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=26831 |title=Swein [Sweyn], earl |last=Williams |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Williams (historian) |date=23 September 2004}}</ref>  Despite his leniency in this matter, Edward was beginning to move against the Godwin family.  He gave the murdered Beorn's earldom to his own nephew [[Ralph the Timid]] rather than to anyone allied to Godwin; he countermanded the election to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishopric of Canterbury]] of Godwin's kinsman [[\u00c6lric (Archbishop-elect of Canterbury)|\u00c6lric]], substituting instead [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]], an enemy of the Godwin clan; and he allowed a small number of castles to be built, or at least planned, by various of his foreign favourites in the earldoms held by Godwin and his sons.{{sfn|Williams|2004}}  \n\nMatters came to a head in 1051 when the men of [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace, Count of Boulogne]], who was passing through [[Dover]], got involved in a fight with the townspeople.  King Edward decided that Dover should be harried as a punishment, and ordered Godwin, within whose earldom Dover lay, to carry out the sentence.  Godwin refused, and prepared for the king's displeasure.  He and his sons gathered an army, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria assembled their men in defence of the king, and the result was a stalemate in which neither side wanted to attack the other.  It was agreed that a meeting of the ''[[Witenagemot|witan]]'' would resolve the dispute, but when the king called up the English [[Fyrd|militia]] Godwin's side found themselves outnumbered there.  The result was that the whole family was banished.  Godwin, his wife, and their sons Sweyn, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] and [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]] fled to [[Bruges]] in Flanders, and Harold and his brother [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] to Ireland, while their sister queen Edith was sent to a nunnery.  The following year, 1052, Godwin and Harold both launched small fleets, joined up off the south-west coast of England, then recruited support from the ports of Sussex and [[Kent]].  This combined and augmented fleet sailed to London, where Godwin forced a new settlement of his differences with the king, entirely in his own favour.  His and his family's earldoms were restored to them, the queen was recalled, and most of the king's numerous French favourites were outlawed.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=562\u2013568}}  So firmly had the family regained its grip on power that Edward never again tried his strength against them.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}  But Godwin did not enjoy his triumph long.  In 1053, while celebrating Easter at [[Winchester]] along with some of his sons and the king, he suddenly collapsed and after a few days died.  In the following century chroniclers embroidered the story with details suggesting that this was divine retribution; in the fullest form of the legend he takes a mouthful of bread, praying that he may not be allowed to swallow it if he was guilty of murdering the king's brother Alfred, then chokes and dies.{{sfn|Mason|2004|pp=79\u201381}}\n\n== Godwin's sons ==\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry (Harold).jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Harold Godwinson]], from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nGodwin's second son, Harold, succeeded him in the earldom of Wessex, while Harold's old earldom of East Anglia was taken by [[\u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia|\u00c6lfgar]], son of the earl of Mercia.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}  Godwin's eldest son, Sweyn, could not be considered for any title since he had gone on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and indeed was to die in September 1052 on the return journey.{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=50}}  Over the next few years one earldom after another fell vacant and was granted to Harold's various younger brothers.  First [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Siward, earl of Northumbria]], died in 1055 and was succeeded by Tostig.{{sfn|Aird|2004}}  Then in 1057 the earl of Mercia died and was succeeded by his son \u00c6lfgar, freeing up East Anglia; a reduced form of this earldom was bestowed on Gyrth, while the counties of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Middlesex]], [[Surrey]] and Kent were formed into a new earldom for Leofwine.  The same year king Edward's nephew Ralph the Timid died, and his earldom of Hereford was added to Harold's Wessex.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=574}}  The Godwin family thus held the whole of England apart from Mercia under the kingship of Edward the Confessor, who was by now largely content to leave effective rule to his earls.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}  \n\nIn 1063 Harold launched a cavalry raid intended to kill Gruffydd ap Llewelyn, who since 1055 had been ruling the whole of Wales, but it failed in its objective.  He returned to the attack the same year along with his brother Tostig in a joint invasion of Wales, using both land and naval forces, which wreaked such destruction that Gruffydd's own men killed him and sent his head to Harold.{{sfn|Barlow|1997|pp=205\u2013211}}  \n\nNot long afterwards, probably in 1064, Harold is thought to have set out on a voyage in the [[English Channel]] and been blown by a storm onto the coast of [[Ponthieu]], whose count delivered him into the hands of [[William the Conqueror|William the Bastard]], [[Duke of Normandy]].  It is not known what the purpose of Harold's journey was.  Norman writers later alleged that he had been sent by king Edward to confirm William as heir to the English throne and to swear fealty to him, but his biographer Ian W. Walker considers the most likely possibilities to be, firstly, that he was seeking a marriage alliance between his family and William's; secondly, that he wanted to negotiate the release of his youngest brother [[Wulfnoth Godwinson|Wulfnoth]] and Sweyn's son [[Hakon Sweynson|Hakon]], who had long been held hostage in Normandy; and thirdly, that he was bound elsewhere for reasons unknown.  Harold accompanied William on a campaign against [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], and then was coerced into swearing an oath that he would support William's claim to be Edward's heir.  Finally, he was allowed to return home.{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=103\u2013116}}\n\nTostig's record as earl of Northumbria was a mixed one.  In external affairs he was rather successful, forming a friendship with the king of Scotland which largely prevented trouble on his northern border, and leading a legation to Rome on Edward's behalf.  But inside his earldom his over-harsh measures to keep the king's peace made him unpopular with his own nobles.{{sfn|Barlow|2003|pp=87\u201390}}  In 1065, while Tostig was at king Edward's court in the south of England, they revolted against him, murdered his men, and demanded his banishment.  Harold, unwilling to provoke a civil war, refused to invade Northumbria to reinstate him, and king Edward reluctantly acceded to the rebels' demands and exiled Tostig.  Furious at his brother's failure to support him, Tostig left for Flanders, and there is evidence that he visited William of Normandy, king [[Sweyn II of Denmark]], and king [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway, in an attempt to find allies who could return him to power.{{sfn|Aird|2004}}  The earldom of Northumbria was given to [[Morcar]], brother of the Mercian earl [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]], and Harold allied himself to the brothers by marrying their sister [[Ealdgyth (daughter of \u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia)|Ealdgyth]].  At the beginning of 1066 Edward the Confessor died childless, after having apparently named Harold as his heir.  The ''witan'', preferring the claims of Harold to those of the late king's great-nephew, the boy [[Edgar \u00c6theling]], elected him as king, and he was crowned the day after Edward's death.  His reign was to last just nine months, and, as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' says, \"he met little quiet in it as long as he ruled the realm\".{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}\n\n== Harold II ==\n{{Main|Harold Godwinson}}\n[[File:Penny of Harold Godwinson.png|thumb|A penny of king [[Harold Godwinson]]]]\n\nHarold faced threats from the duke of Normandy, from the king of Norway, and from possible Welsh raiders, but the first to act was his own brother Tostig, who in the spring of 1066 launched raids on the [[Isle of Wight]] and various points on the east coast of England before suffering a severe defeat in [[Lincolnshire]] and taking refuge in Scotland.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}{{sfn|Douglas|1999|p=190}}  Harold, expecting an invasion by William of Normandy, moved to the south coast to prepare his defences, but on 8 September, unable to provision his forces any longer, he was compelled to disband them.{{sfn|Douglas|1999|pp=191\u2013192}}  The same month, Harald Hardrada set out from Norway on his attempt to take the English crown, sailing via [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]] and joining up with Tostig at the [[river Tyne]], where the latter took service under him as one of his earls.<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=49272 |title=Harald Hardrada [Haraldr inn Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i, Haraldr Sigur\u00f0arson] |last=Krag |first=Claus |date=25 May 2006}}</ref>  Together they engaged a Northumbrian army at [[Fulford, North Yorkshire|Fulford]] in [[Yorkshire]], gained a complete victory, and took the city of [[York]].  Harold Godwinson hurriedly recalled his army and by forced marches was able to surprise Harald and Tostig's army at [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]] on 25 September, only five days after the [[battle of Fulford]], and inflicted a crushing defeat on them.{{sfn|Walker|2010|pp=177\u2013186}}  He allowed the few survivors, including Tostig's sons Skule and Ketel, to return in peace to Norway.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=138}}  Three days later duke William landed his invasion fleet at [[Pevensey]] in Sussex, then moved on to [[Hastings]] and began to ravage the Sussex countryside, part of Harold's old earldom of Wessex.  This achieved its intended effect of provoking Harold to march south with all speed.  On 14 October the two armies met seven miles north of Hastings, where the town of [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] now stands.  Harold, accompanied by his brothers Gyrth and Leofwine, commanded an army that was now badly overtired and proved unable to withstand the [[Battle of Hastings|repeated Norman attacks]].  By the end of the day Harold's army was comprehensively defeated, all three brothers were dead, and the ruin of Anglo-Saxon England was accomplished.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=29448 |title=William I [known as William the Conqueror] |last=Bates |first=David |date=19 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n== The family disperses ==\n\nOnly two members of the family were allowed to live undisturbed in England under Norman rule.  Edward the Confessor's widow Edith, daughter of Godwin, lived in retirement, remaining in possession of all her private lands, until her death in 1075.  She was buried near her husband in [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Barlow|2013|pp. 160\u2013161}}  Her niece [[Gunhild of Wessex|Gunhild]], daughter of Harold Godwinson, was an inmate of [[Wilton Abbey|the nunnery]] in [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] until 1093, when she was abducted by [[Alan Rufus|Alan the Red]], a Breton who held the lordship of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]].  She lived with him, and then with his successor [[Alan the Black]], after which she disappears from history.{{sfn|Mason|2004|pp. 198\u2013199}}\n\nGodwin's youngest son, Wulfnoth (b. ''c''. 1036), was kept as a hostage in Normandy from 1051 until William the Conqueror's death in 1087, and was then transferred to Winchester by [[William II of England|William Rufus]], where he may have become a monk.

No further mention of Harold appears in any source.{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=220}}\n\nAfter the battle of Stamford Bridge and the death of Harald Hardrada, Skule and Ketel, the two sons of Tostig Godwinson, were taken to Norway under the wing of Hardrada's son [[Olaf III of Norway|Olaf]].  Olaf, who became king of Norway, gave land to Ketel and arranged a good marriage for him; according to the 13th-century saga-writer [[Snorri Sturluson]], \"from him are descended many great people\".  Skule became known as Skule Kongsfostre (king's foster-son), and was remembered as a remarkably intelligent and handsome man who commanded the king's [[hird]].  He married a relative of the king, Gudrun Nevsteinsdotter, and their son was \u00c5solv of Rein (in [[Rissa, Norway|Rissa]]), father of the [[lendmann]] Guttorm of Rein.{{sfn|Barlow|2013|p=168}}{{sfn|Snorri Sturluson|1951|pp=237\u2013238}}{{sfn|Bj\u00f8rgo|2009a}}  Guttorm's son, B\u00e5rd Guttormsson of Rein, was a close friend and supporter of king [[Sverre of Norway|Sverre Sigurdsson]], fought alongside him in several battles, and was rewarded by being given the king's half-sister, [[Cecilia Sigurdsdotter]], in marriage.{{sfn|Bj\u00f8rgo|2009a}}  B\u00e5rd and Cecilia's son [[Inge II of Norway|Inge B\u00e5rdsson]] was born about the year 1185.  In 1204, when the child-king [[Guttorm of Norway|Guttorm Sigurdsson]] died, the two obvious candidates for the crown were Inge and his half-brother [[Haakon the Crazy|Haakon Galen]], Cecilia's son by another husband.  After a struggle for power Inge was recognized as king, while Haakon retained his former command of the army.  This did not produce peace, for a faction known as the ''[[Bagler]]'' succeeded in splitting the kingdom, with Inge ruling the western half and their own candidate, [[Philip Simonsson]], the eastern half.  Moreover, earl Haakon renewed his own claim to the crown, a claim which only lapsed with his death in 1214.  King Inge himself died in 1217.{{sfn|Helte|2009}}  Since 1213 the leader of the army and the hird had been Inge's half-brother [[Skule B\u00e5rdsson|Skule]], a son of B\u00e5rd Guttormsson by another wife, Ragnfrid Erlingsdotter, and therefore, like king Inge, fifth in descent in the male line from Tostig Godwinson.  The new king, [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon IV]], was no more than a boy, with Skule acting as his regent.  In 1225 Skule married his young daughter, [[Margrete Skulesdatter|Margrete]], to the king, but this did not succeed in establishing perfect amity between the two men, and in 1239 Skule went into open rebellion, claiming the title of king for himself.  The subsequent war went against him, and he was killed in 1240.{{sfn|Bj\u00f8rgo|2009b}}  From Haakon IV and Margrete Skulesdotter descend subsequent kings of Norway down to the present day.<ref>{{cite book |last1=K\u00f8nigsfeldt |first1=J.

This can occasionally result in gaps when maintaining records that incorrectly make that assumption, such as the \"missing\" entries for USA-163 (which are, symmetrically, contemporary with confusion over \"splitting\" spacecraft tracks).<ref name=\"USA-163\">{{cite web |url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Jan-2002/0169.html |title=SeeSat-L - Milstar 5 on OIG |publisher=[[SeeSat-L]] |date=16 January 2002 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==List==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
