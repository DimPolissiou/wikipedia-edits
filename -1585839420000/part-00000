But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid \u00a36&nbsp;million for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Andy Cole]], in a deal which also saw \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]] move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994\u201395 season included: [[Vinny Samways]] (Tottenham to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[David Rocastle]] ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to Chelsea, \u00a31.25&nbsp;million), [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] ([[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[John Scales]] ([[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], \u00a33&nbsp;million) and [[Paul Kitson]] ([[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] to Newcastle United, \u00a32.2&nbsp;million).\n\n===Summary===\nThe title race was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (last [[1927\u201328 FA Cup]]).<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/blackburn-rovers/11607118/Blackburn-Rovers-winning-the-Premier-League-might-never-be-surpassed.html |title=Blackburn Rovers winning the Premier League might never be surpassed|date=|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\n[[Kenny Dalglish]]'s side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2\u20131 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/2015 |title=Liverpool 2 Blackburn 1|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\nThis meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a [[UEFA Cup]] place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season.\n\nAlso qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in the club's first full season following the appointment of [[Roy Evans]]) and fifth placed [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nThe number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two.\n\n===Controversial incidents===\nIn January 1995, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s 28-year-old French [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Eric Cantona]] (then holder of the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan in his team's 1\u20131 draw at [[Selhurst Park]]. Cantona was banned from [[association football|football]] for eight months, fined \u00a320,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.\n\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] [[midfielder]] [[Dennis Wise]] was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.\n\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Paul Merson]] admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to [[cocaine]] and gambling. He underwent a three-month [[drug rehabilitation]] programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.\n\nCrystal Palace striker [[Chris Armstrong (footballer, born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] just one season after winning promotion.\n\nArsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of \u00a3425,000 from Norwegian agent [[Rune Hauge]] relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players [[P\u00e5l Lydersen]] and [[John Jensen]] three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the [[The Football Association|FA]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1993\u201394 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1994\u201395 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

sponsorship reasons) was the third season of the [[Premier League]], the top division of professional [[association football|football]] in England.\n\n==Overview==\n===Transfers===\nJust before the start of the 1994\u201395 season, the English transfer record was broken when [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] paid \u00a35&nbsp;million for 21-year-old [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] striker [[Chris Sutton]]. But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid \u00a36&nbsp;million for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Andy Cole]], in a deal which also saw \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]] move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994\u201395 season included: [[Vinny Samways]] (Tottenham to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[David Rocastle]] ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to Chelsea, \u00a31.25&nbsp;million), [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] ([[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[John Scales]] ([[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], \u00a33&nbsp;million) and [[Paul Kitson]] ([[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] to Newcastle United, \u00a32.2&nbsp;million).\n\n===Summary===\nThe title race was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (last [[1927\u201328 FA Cup]]).<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/blackburn-rovers/11607118/Blackburn-Rovers-winning-the-Premier-League-might-never-be-surpassed.html |title=Blackburn Rovers winning the Premier League might never be surpassed|date=|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\n[[Kenny Dalglish]]'s side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2\u20131 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/2015 |title=Liverpool 2 Blackburn 1|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\nThis meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a [[UEFA Cup]] place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season.\n\nAlso qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in the club's first full season following the appointment of [[Roy Evans]]) and fifth placed [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nThe number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two.\n\n===Controversial incidents===\nIn January 1995, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s 28-year-old French [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Eric Cantona]] (then holder of the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan in his team's 1\u20131 draw at [[Selhurst Park]]. Cantona was banned from [[association football|football]] for eight months, fined \u00a320,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.\n\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] [[midfielder]] [[Dennis Wise]] was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.\n\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Paul Merson]] admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to [[cocaine]] and gambling. He underwent a three-month [[drug rehabilitation]] programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.\n\nCrystal Palace striker [[Chris Armstrong (footballer, born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] just one season after winning promotion.\n\nArsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of \u00a3425,000 from Norwegian agent [[Rune Hauge]] relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players [[P\u00e5l Lydersen]] and [[John Jensen]] three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the [[The Football Association|FA]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1993\u201394 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1994\u201395 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the [[dura mater]], [[arachnoid mater]], and [[pia mater]]. The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the ''leptomeninges''. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the [[subarachnoid space]] which contains [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). This fluid circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through the cavities in the brain called [[Ventricular system|ventricles]], to support and protect the brain tissue. [[Blood vessels]] enter the [[central nervous system]] through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] which protects the brain from [[toxins]] that might enter through the blood.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Clinically oriented anatomy|last=Moore, Keith L.|others=Agur, A.

Living brain tissue has a pink tint in color on the outside ([[grey matter|gray matter]]), and nearly complete white on the inside ([[white matter]]), with subtle variations in color. The three largest divisions of the brain are: \n*[[Cerebrum|Cerebral cortex]]\n*[[Brainstem]]\n*[[Cerebellum]]<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThese areas are composed of two broad classes of cells: [[neurons]] and [[glia]]. These two types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although [[glial cells]] outnumber [[neurons]] roughly 4 to 1 in the [[cerebral cortex]]. Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://training.seer.cancer.gov/brain/tumors/anatomy/neurons.html|title=Neurons & Glial Cells {{!}} SEER Training|website=training.seer.cancer.gov|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Primary tumors of the glial cells are called [[glioma]]s and often are malignant by the time they are diagnosed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostrom QT, Gittleman H, Farah P, Ondracek A, Chen Y, Wolinsky Y, Stroup NE, Kruchko C, Barnholtz-Sloan JS | display-authors = 6 | title = CBTRUS statistical report: Primary brain and central nervous system tumors diagnosed in the United States in 2006-2010 | journal = Neuro-Oncology | volume = 15 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = ii1-56 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24137015 | pmc = 3798196 | doi = 10.1093/neuonc/not151 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[thalamus]] and [[hypothalamus]] are major divisions of the [[diencephalon]], with the [[pituitary gland]] and [[pineal gland]] attached at the bottom; tumors of the [[pituitary]] and [[pineal gland]] are often benign.\n\nThe [[brainstem]] lies between the large cerebral cortex and the spinal cord.

Brain tumors have similar characteristics and obstacles when it comes to diagnosis and therapy with tumors located elsewhere in the body. However, they create specific issues that follow closely to the properties of the organ they are in.<ref name=\"Herholz\" />\n\nThe diagnosis will often start by taking a [[medical history]] noting medical antecedents, and current symptoms. Clinical and laboratory investigations will serve to exclude infections as the cause of the symptoms. Examinations in this stage may include the eyes, [[otolaryngology|otolaryngological]] (or ENT) and electrophysiological exams. The use of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) often plays a role in the diagnosis of brain tumors.\n\nBrain tumors, when compared to tumors in other areas of the body, pose a challenge for diagnosis. Commonly, [[radioactive tracer]]s are uptaken in large volumes in tumors due to the high activity of tumor cells, allowing for radioactive imaging of the tumor. However, most of the brain is separated from the blood by the [[blood-brain barrier]] (BBB), a membrane which exerts a strict control over what substances are allowed to pass into the brain. Therefore, many tracers that may reach tumors in other areas of the body easily would be unable to reach brain tumors until there was a disruption of the BBB by the tumor. Disruption of the BBB is well imaged via MRI or CT scan, and is therefore regarded as the main diagnostic indicator for malignant gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases.<ref name=\"Herholz\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Herholz K, Langen KJ, Schiepers C, Mountz JM | title = Brain tumors | journal = Seminars in Nuclear Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 356\u201370 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23026359 | pmc = 3925448 | doi = 10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2012.06.001 }}</ref>\n\nSwelling or obstruction of the passage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) from the brain may cause (early) signs of increased [[intracranial pressure]] which translates clinically into [[headaches]], [[vomiting]], or an altered state of [[consciousness]], and in children changes to the diameter of the [[human skull|skull]] and bulging of the [[fontanelle]]s.

Swelling around the tumor known as ''peritumoral edema'' can also show a similar result.\n\nThis is because these tumors disrupt the normal functioning of the BBB and lead to an increase in its permeability.

The histological examination is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and the correct [[prognosis]]. This examination, performed by a [[pathologist]], typically has three stages: interoperative examination of fresh tissue, preliminary microscopic examination of prepared tissues, and follow-up examination of prepared tissues after immunohistochemical staining or genetic analysis.\n\n===Pathology===\n[[Image:Oligodendroglioma1 high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of an [[oligodendroglioma]], a type of brain cancer. Brain [[biopsy]]. [[H&E stain]]]]\nTumors have characteristics that allow determination of malignancy and how they will evolve, and determining these characteristics will allow the medical team to determine the management plan.\n\n[[Anaplasia]] or dedifferentiation: loss of differentiation of cells and of their orientation to one another and blood vessels, a characteristic of anaplastic tumor tissue. Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nucleus of anaplastic cells are usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the dedifferentiation causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).\n\n[[Atypia]]: an indication of abnormality of a cell (which may be indicative for malignancy). Significance of the abnormality is highly dependent on context.\n\n[[Neoplasia]]: the (uncontrolled) division of cells. As such, neoplasia is not problematic but its consequences are: the uncontrolled division of cells means that the mass of a neoplasm increases in size, and in a confined space such as the intracranial cavity this quickly becomes problematic because the mass invades the space of the brain pushing it aside, leading to compression of the brain tissue and increased intracranial pressure and destruction of [[Parenchyma|brain parenchyma]]. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be attributable to the direct mass effect of the tumor, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, which may, in turn, have secondary symptoms.\n\n[[Necrosis]]: the (premature) death of cells, caused by external factors such as infection, toxin or trauma. Necrotic cells send the wrong chemical signals which prevent [[phagocyte]]s from disposing of the dead cells, leading to a buildup of dead tissue, cell debris and toxins at or near the site of the necrotic cells<ref name=necrs>{{MedlinePlus|002266|Necrosis}}</ref>\n\nArterial and venous [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or the deprivation of adequate oxygen supply to certain areas of the brain, occurs when a tumor makes use of nearby blood vessels for its supply of blood and the neoplasm enters into competition for nutrients with the surrounding brain tissue.\n\nMore generally a neoplasm may cause release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function.\n\n===Classification===\nTumors can be [[benign]] or [[malignant]], can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be classified as primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a [[metastasis|metastatic]] tumor, which is one that has spread to the brain from another area of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/brain/page1|title=What you need to know about brain tumors|publisher=National Cancer Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127124137/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/brain/page1|archive-date=27 January 2012|url-status=live|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref> The incidence of metastatic tumors is approximately four times greater than primary tumors.<ref name=Mer2012/> Tumors may or may not be [[symptomatic]]: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.\n\n[[Grading of the tumors of the central nervous system]] commonly occurs on a 4-point scale (I-IV) created by the World Health Organization in 1993. Grade I tumors are the least severe and commonly associated with long term survival, with severity and prognosis worsening as the grade increases.

This means that a cancerous neoplasm has developed in another organ elsewhere in the body and that cancer cells have leaked from that primary tumor and then entered the [[lymphatic system]] and [[blood vessels]].  They then circulate through the bloodstream, and are deposited in the brain. There, these cells continue growing and dividing, becoming another invasive neoplasm of the primary cancer's tissue. Secondary tumors of the brain are very common in the terminal phases of patients with an incurable metastasized cancer; the most common types of cancers that bring about secondary tumors of the brain are [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], malignant [[melanoma]], [[kidney cancer]], and [[colon cancer]] (in decreasing order of frequency).\n\nSecondary brain tumors are more common than primary ones; in the United States there are about 170,000 new cases every year. Secondary brain tumors are the most common cause of tumors in the intracranial cavity. The [[human skull|skull]] bone structure can also be subject to a neoplasm that by its very nature reduces the volume of the intracranial cavity, and can damage the brain.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000769|Metastatic brain tumor}}</ref>\n\n=====By behavior=====\nBrain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be [[cancerous]] (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). However, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differ from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body.\nIn cancers elsewhere in the body, three malignant properties differentiate benign tumors from malignant forms of cancer: benign tumors are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Characteristics of malignant tumors include:\n\n* uncontrolled mitosis (growth by division beyond the normal limits)\n* [[anaplasia]]: the cells in the neoplasm have an obviously different form (in size and shape). Anaplastic cells display marked [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]]. The [[cell nuclei]] are characteristically extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and enlarged; the nucleus might have the same size as the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell (nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1, instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6 ratio). [[Giant cells]] \u2013 considerably larger than their neighbors \u2013 may form and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei ([[syncytium|syncytia]]). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape.\n* invasion or infiltration (medical literature uses these terms as synonymous equivalents. However, for clarity, the articles that follow adhere to a convention that they mean slightly different things; this convention is not followed outside these articles):\n** Invasion or invasiveness is the spatial expansion of the tumor through uncontrolled mitosis, in the sense that the neoplasm invades the space occupied by adjacent tissue, thereby pushing the other tissue aside and eventually compressing the tissue. Often these tumors are associated with clearly outlined tumors in imaging.\n** Infiltration is the behavior of the tumor either to grow (microscopic) tentacles that push into the surrounding tissue (often making the outline of the tumor undefined or diffuse) or to have tumor cells \"seeded\" into the tissue beyond the circumference of the tumorous mass; this does not mean that an infiltrative tumor does not take up space or does not compress the surrounding tissue as it grows, but an infiltrating neoplasm makes it difficult to say where the tumor ends and the healthy tissue starts.\n* [[metastasis]] (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood).\n\nOf the above malignant characteristics, some elements do not apply to primary neoplasms of the brain:\n* Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize to other organs; some forms of primary brain tumors can metastasize but will not spread outside the intracranial cavity or the central spinal canal. Due to the BBB, cancerous cells of a primary neoplasm cannot enter the bloodstream and get carried to another location in the body. (Occasional isolated case reports suggest spread of certain brain tumors outside the central nervous system, e.g. bone metastasis of [[glioblastoma multiforme]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frappaz D, Mornex F, Saint-Pierre G, Ranchere-Vince D, Jouvet A, Chassagne-Clement C, Thiesse P, Mere P, Deruty R | display-authors = 6 | title = Bone metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme confirmed by fine needle biopsy | journal = Acta Neurochirurgica | volume = 141 | issue = 5 | pages = 551\u20132 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10392217 | doi = 10.1007/s007010050342 }}</ref>)\n* Primary brain tumors generally are invasive (i.e. they will expand spatially and intrude into the space occupied by other brain tissue and compress those brain tissues); however, some of the more malignant primary brain tumors will infiltrate the surrounding tissue.\n\n==== By genetics ====\nIn 2016, the WHO restructured their classifications of some categories of [[glioma]]s to include distinct [[genetic mutations]] that have been useful in differentiating tumor types, prognoses, and treatment responses.

Large [[pituitary adenoma]]s require a [[craniotomy]] (opening of the skull) for their removal.

Radiotherapy may also be administered in cases of \"low-grade\" gliomas when a significant tumor reduction could not be achieved surgically.\n\nMultiple metastatic tumors are generally treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy rather than surgery and the prognosis in such cases is determined by the primary tumor, and is generally poor.\n\n===Radiation therapy===\nThe goal of radiation therapy is to kill tumor cells while leaving normal brain tissue unharmed. In standard [[external beam radiation therapy]], multiple treatments of standard-dose \"fractions\" of radiation are applied to the brain. This process is repeated for a total of 10 to 30 treatments, depending on the type of tumor. This additional treatment provides some patients with improved outcomes and longer survival rates.\n\n[[Radiosurgery]] is a treatment method that uses computerized calculations to focus radiation at the site of the tumor while minimizing the radiation dose to the surrounding brain. Radiosurgery may be an adjunct to other treatments, or it may represent the primary treatment technique for some tumors. Forms used include [[stereotactic]] radiosurgery, such as [[Gamma knife]], [[Cyberknife]] or [[Novalis radiosurgery|Novalis Tx]] [[radiosurgery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcyberknife.com/comparison.htm |title=Radiosurgery treatment comparisons \u2013 Cyberknife, Gamma knife, Novalis Tx |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520230154/http://www.sdcyberknife.com/comparison.htm |archive-date=20 May 2007  }}</ref>{{medrs|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] is the most common treatment for secondary brain tumors.

Although chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients with the most malignant primary brain tumors, it does so in only about 20 percent of patients. [[Chemotherapy]] is often used in young children instead of radiation, as radiation may have negative effects on the developing brain. The decision to prescribe this treatment is based on a patient's overall health, type of tumor, and extent of the cancer. The toxicity and many side effects of the drugs, and the uncertain outcome of chemotherapy in brain tumors puts this treatment further down the line of treatment options with surgery and radiation therapy preferred.\n\nUCLA Neuro-Oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.

Brainstem gliomas have the poorest prognosis of any form of brain cancer, with most patients dying within one year, even with therapy that typically consists of radiation to the tumor along with [[corticosteroid]]s.

Tumors originating from the meninges are meningiomas.]]\nHuman brains are surrounded by a system of [[connective tissue]] membranes called [[meninges]] that separate the [[Human brain|brain]] from the [[Human skull|skull]]. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the [[dura mater]], [[arachnoid mater]], and [[pia mater]]. The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the ''leptomeninges''. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the [[subarachnoid space]] which contains [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). This fluid circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through the cavities in the brain called [[Ventricular system|ventricles]], to support and protect the brain tissue. [[Blood vessels]] enter the [[central nervous system]] through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] which protects the brain from [[toxins]] that might enter through the blood.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Clinically oriented anatomy|last=Moore, Keith L.|others=Agur, A.

Though not technically a tumor of brain tissue, they are often considered brain tumors since they protrude into the space where the brain is, causing symptoms. Since they are usually slow-growing tumors, meningiomas can be quite large by the time symptoms appear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neurosurgery.ucla.edu/meningioma-brain-tumor|title=Meningioma Brain Tumor|website=neurosurgery.ucla.edu|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brain matter===\nThe brains of humans and other [[vertebrates]] are composed of very soft tissue and have a gelatin-like texture. Living brain tissue has a pink tint in color on the outside ([[grey matter|gray matter]]), and nearly complete white on the inside ([[white matter]]), with subtle variations in color. The three largest divisions of the brain are: \n*[[Cerebrum|Cerebral cortex]]\n*[[Brainstem]]\n*[[Cerebellum]]<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThese areas are composed of two broad classes of cells: [[neurons]] and [[glia]]. These two types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although [[glial cells]] outnumber [[neurons]] roughly 4 to 1 in the [[cerebral cortex]]. Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://training.seer.cancer.gov/brain/tumors/anatomy/neurons.html|title=Neurons & Glial Cells {{!}} SEER Training|website=training.seer.cancer.gov|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Primary tumors of the glial cells are called [[glioma]]s and often are malignant by the time they are diagnosed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostrom QT, Gittleman H, Farah P, Ondracek A, Chen Y, Wolinsky Y, Stroup NE, Kruchko C, Barnholtz-Sloan JS | display-authors = 6 | title = CBTRUS statistical report: Primary brain and central nervous system tumors diagnosed in the United States in 2006-2010 | journal = Neuro-Oncology | volume = 15 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = ii1-56 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24137015 | pmc = 3798196 | doi = 10.1093/neuonc/not151 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[thalamus]] and [[hypothalamus]] are major divisions of the [[diencephalon]], with the [[pituitary gland]] and [[pineal gland]] attached at the bottom; tumors of the [[pituitary]] and [[pineal gland]] are often benign.\n\nThe [[brainstem]] lies between the large cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. It is divided into the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Spinal cord ===\nThe [[spinal cord]] is considered a part of the [[central nervous system]]. It is made up of the same cells as the brain: neurons and glial cells.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Postermass.png|thumb|A posterior fossa tumor leading to mass effect and midline shift]]\n\nAlthough there is no specific or singular symptom or sign, the presence of a combination of symptoms and the lack of corresponding indications of other causes can be an indicator for investigation towards the possibility of a brain tumor. Brain tumors have similar characteristics and obstacles when it comes to diagnosis and therapy with tumors located elsewhere in the body. However, they create specific issues that follow closely to the properties of the organ they are in.<ref name=\"Herholz\" />\n\nThe diagnosis will often start by taking a [[medical history]] noting medical antecedents, and current symptoms. Clinical and laboratory investigations will serve to exclude infections as the cause of the symptoms. Examinations in this stage may include the eyes, [[otolaryngology|otolaryngological]] (or ENT) and electrophysiological exams. The use of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) often plays a role in the diagnosis of brain tumors.\n\nBrain tumors, when compared to tumors in other areas of the body, pose a challenge for diagnosis. Commonly, [[radioactive tracer]]s are uptaken in large volumes in tumors due to the high activity of tumor cells, allowing for radioactive imaging of the tumor. However, most of the brain is separated from the blood by the [[blood-brain barrier]] (BBB), a membrane which exerts a strict control over what substances are allowed to pass into the brain. Therefore, many tracers that may reach tumors in other areas of the body easily would be unable to reach brain tumors until there was a disruption of the BBB by the tumor. Disruption of the BBB is well imaged via MRI or CT scan, and is therefore regarded as the main diagnostic indicator for malignant gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases.<ref name=\"Herholz\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Herholz K, Langen KJ, Schiepers C, Mountz JM | title = Brain tumors | journal = Seminars in Nuclear Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 356\u201370 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23026359 | pmc = 3925448 | doi = 10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2012.06.001 }}</ref>\n\nSwelling or obstruction of the passage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) from the brain may cause (early) signs of increased [[intracranial pressure]] which translates clinically into [[headaches]], [[vomiting]], or an altered state of [[consciousness]], and in children changes to the diameter of the [[human skull|skull]] and bulging of the [[fontanelle]]s. More complex symptoms such as endocrine dysfunctions should alarm doctors not to exclude brain tumors.\n\nA bilateral temporal [[visual field]] defect (due to compression of the [[optic chiasm]]) or dilation of the pupil, and the occurrence of either slowly evolving or the sudden onset of [[focal neurologic symptom]]s, such as [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] impairment (including impaired judgment, memory loss, lack of recognition, spatial orientation disorders), [[Wiktionary:personality|personality]] or emotional changes, [[hemiparesis]], [[hypoesthesia]], [[aphasia]], [[ataxia]], [[visual field]] impairment, impaired sense of smell, impaired hearing, [[facial paralysis]], [[diplopia|double vision]], or more severe symptoms such as [[tremor]]s, paralysis on one side of the body [[hemiplegia]], or (epileptic) seizures in a patient with a negative history for epilepsy, should raise the possibility of a brain tumor.\n\n===Imaging===\n[[File:CT brain tumor.jpg|thumb|[[CT scan]] of a brain tumor, with its diameters marked as an X.

Early imaging methods&nbsp;\u2013 invasive and sometimes dangerous&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[pneumoencephalography]] and cerebral [[angiography]] have been abandoned in favor of non-invasive, high-resolution techniques, especially [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans, though MRI is typically the reference standard used.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Iv M, Yoon BC, Heit JJ, Fischbein N, Wintermark M | title = Current Clinical State of Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Brain Tumor Diagnosis and Follow Up | journal = Seminars in Roentgenology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 45\u201361 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29405955 | doi = 10.1053/j.ro.2017.11.005 }}</ref> Neoplasms will often show as differently colored masses (also referred to as processes) in CT or MRI results.\n\n* Benign brain tumors often show up as hypodense (darker than brain tissue) mass lesions on CT scans.

Swelling around the tumor known as ''peritumoral edema'' can also show a similar result.\n\nThis is because these tumors disrupt the normal functioning of the BBB and lead to an increase in its permeability. More recently, advancements have been made to increase the utility of MRI in providing physiological data that can help to inform diagnosis and prognosis.

The histological examination is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and the correct [[prognosis]]. This examination, performed by a [[pathologist]], typically has three stages: interoperative examination of fresh tissue, preliminary microscopic examination of prepared tissues, and follow-up examination of prepared tissues after immunohistochemical staining or genetic analysis.\n\n===Pathology===\n[[Image:Oligodendroglioma1 high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of an [[oligodendroglioma]], a type of brain cancer. Brain [[biopsy]]. [[H&E stain]]]]\nTumors have characteristics that allow determination of malignancy and how they will evolve, and determining these characteristics will allow the medical team to determine the management plan.\n\n[[Anaplasia]] or dedifferentiation: loss of differentiation of cells and of their orientation to one another and blood vessels, a characteristic of anaplastic tumor tissue. Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nucleus of anaplastic cells are usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the dedifferentiation causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).\n\n[[Atypia]]: an indication of abnormality of a cell (which may be indicative for malignancy). Significance of the abnormality is highly dependent on context.\n\n[[Neoplasia]]: the (uncontrolled) division of cells. As such, neoplasia is not problematic but its consequences are: the uncontrolled division of cells means that the mass of a neoplasm increases in size, and in a confined space such as the intracranial cavity this quickly becomes problematic because the mass invades the space of the brain pushing it aside, leading to compression of the brain tissue and increased intracranial pressure and destruction of [[Parenchyma|brain parenchyma]]. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be attributable to the direct mass effect of the tumor, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, which may, in turn, have secondary symptoms.\n\n[[Necrosis]]: the (premature) death of cells, caused by external factors such as infection, toxin or trauma. Necrotic cells send the wrong chemical signals which prevent [[phagocyte]]s from disposing of the dead cells, leading to a buildup of dead tissue, cell debris and toxins at or near the site of the necrotic cells<ref name=necrs>{{MedlinePlus|002266|Necrosis}}</ref>\n\nArterial and venous [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or the deprivation of adequate oxygen supply to certain areas of the brain, occurs when a tumor makes use of nearby blood vessels for its supply of blood and the neoplasm enters into competition for nutrients with the surrounding brain tissue.\n\nMore generally a neoplasm may cause release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function.\n\n===Classification===\nTumors can be [[benign]] or [[malignant]], can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be classified as primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a [[metastasis|metastatic]] tumor, which is one that has spread to the brain from another area of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/brain/page1|title=What you need to know about brain tumors|publisher=National Cancer Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127124137/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/brain/page1|archive-date=27 January 2012|url-status=live|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref> The incidence of metastatic tumors is approximately four times greater than primary tumors.<ref name=Mer2012/> Tumors may or may not be [[symptomatic]]: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.\n\n[[Grading of the tumors of the central nervous system]] commonly occurs on a 4-point scale (I-IV) created by the World Health Organization in 1993. Grade I tumors are the least severe and commonly associated with long term survival, with severity and prognosis worsening as the grade increases. Low grade tumors are often benign, while higher grades are aggressively malignant and/or metastatic. Other grading scales do exist, many based upon the same criteria as the WHO scale and graded from I-IV.\n\n==== Primary ====\nThe most common primary brain tumors are:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Meningiomas: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Outcome| last1 = Park | first1 = Bong Jin | last2 = Kim | first2 = Han Kyu | last3 = Sade | first3 = Burak | last4 = Lee | first4 = Joung H. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84882-910-7| veditors = Lee JH |page=11|chapter=Epidemiology}}\n</ref>\n\n*[[Gliomas]] (50.4%)\n*[[Meningiomas]] (20.8%)\n*[[Pituitary adenomas]] (15%)\n*[[Nerve sheath tumors]] (8%)\n\nThese common tumors can also be organized according to tissue of origin as shown below:<ref name=\"AANS 41723ct\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aans.org/en/Media/Classifications-of-Brain-Tumors|title=Classifications of Brain Tumors|website=AANS|publisher=American Association of Neurological Surgeons|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085734/http://www.aans.org/en/Media/Classifications-of-Brain-Tumors|archive-date=24 April 2017|url-status=live|access-date=23 April 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \nTissue of origin\n!

This means that a cancerous neoplasm has developed in another organ elsewhere in the body and that cancer cells have leaked from that primary tumor and then entered the [[lymphatic system]] and [[blood vessels]].  They then circulate through the bloodstream, and are deposited in the brain. There, these cells continue growing and dividing, becoming another invasive neoplasm of the primary cancer's tissue. Secondary tumors of the brain are very common in the terminal phases of patients with an incurable metastasized cancer; the most common types of cancers that bring about secondary tumors of the brain are [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], malignant [[melanoma]], [[kidney cancer]], and [[colon cancer]] (in decreasing order of frequency).\n\nSecondary brain tumors are more common than primary ones; in the United States there are about 170,000 new cases every year. Secondary brain tumors are the most common cause of tumors in the intracranial cavity. The [[human skull|skull]] bone structure can also be subject to a neoplasm that by its very nature reduces the volume of the intracranial cavity, and can damage the brain.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000769|Metastatic brain tumor}}</ref>\n\n=====By behavior=====\nBrain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be [[cancerous]] (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). However, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differ from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body.\nIn cancers elsewhere in the body, three malignant properties differentiate benign tumors from malignant forms of cancer: benign tumors are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Characteristics of malignant tumors include:\n\n* uncontrolled mitosis (growth by division beyond the normal limits)\n* [[anaplasia]]: the cells in the neoplasm have an obviously different form (in size and shape). Anaplastic cells display marked [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]]. The [[cell nuclei]] are characteristically extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and enlarged; the nucleus might have the same size as the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell (nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1, instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6 ratio). [[Giant cells]] \u2013 considerably larger than their neighbors \u2013 may form and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei ([[syncytium|syncytia]]). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape.\n* invasion or infiltration (medical literature uses these terms as synonymous equivalents. However, for clarity, the articles that follow adhere to a convention that they mean slightly different things; this convention is not followed outside these articles):\n** Invasion or invasiveness is the spatial expansion of the tumor through uncontrolled mitosis, in the sense that the neoplasm invades the space occupied by adjacent tissue, thereby pushing the other tissue aside and eventually compressing the tissue. Often these tumors are associated with clearly outlined tumors in imaging.\n** Infiltration is the behavior of the tumor either to grow (microscopic) tentacles that push into the surrounding tissue (often making the outline of the tumor undefined or diffuse) or to have tumor cells \"seeded\" into the tissue beyond the circumference of the tumorous mass; this does not mean that an infiltrative tumor does not take up space or does not compress the surrounding tissue as it grows, but an infiltrating neoplasm makes it difficult to say where the tumor ends and the healthy tissue starts.\n* [[metastasis]] (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood).\n\nOf the above malignant characteristics, some elements do not apply to primary neoplasms of the brain:\n* Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize to other organs; some forms of primary brain tumors can metastasize but will not spread outside the intracranial cavity or the central spinal canal. Due to the BBB, cancerous cells of a primary neoplasm cannot enter the bloodstream and get carried to another location in the body. (Occasional isolated case reports suggest spread of certain brain tumors outside the central nervous system, e.g. bone metastasis of [[glioblastoma multiforme]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frappaz D, Mornex F, Saint-Pierre G, Ranchere-Vince D, Jouvet A, Chassagne-Clement C, Thiesse P, Mere P, Deruty R | display-authors = 6 | title = Bone metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme confirmed by fine needle biopsy | journal = Acta Neurochirurgica | volume = 141 | issue = 5 | pages = 551\u20132 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10392217 | doi = 10.1007/s007010050342 }}</ref>)\n* Primary brain tumors generally are invasive (i.e. they will expand spatially and intrude into the space occupied by other brain tissue and compress those brain tissues); however, some of the more malignant primary brain tumors will infiltrate the surrounding tissue.\n\n==== By genetics ====\nIn 2016, the WHO restructured their classifications of some categories of [[glioma]]s to include distinct [[genetic mutations]] that have been useful in differentiating tumor types, prognoses, and treatment responses.

Radiotherapy may also be administered in cases of \"low-grade\" gliomas when a significant tumor reduction could not be achieved surgically.\n\nMultiple metastatic tumors are generally treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy rather than surgery and the prognosis in such cases is determined by the primary tumor, and is generally poor.\n\n===Radiation therapy===\nThe goal of radiation therapy is to kill tumor cells while leaving normal brain tissue unharmed. In standard [[external beam radiation therapy]], multiple treatments of standard-dose \"fractions\" of radiation are applied to the brain. This process is repeated for a total of 10 to 30 treatments, depending on the type of tumor. This additional treatment provides some patients with improved outcomes and longer survival rates.\n\n[[Radiosurgery]] is a treatment method that uses computerized calculations to focus radiation at the site of the tumor while minimizing the radiation dose to the surrounding brain. Radiosurgery may be an adjunct to other treatments, or it may represent the primary treatment technique for some tumors. Forms used include [[stereotactic]] radiosurgery, such as [[Gamma knife]], [[Cyberknife]] or [[Novalis radiosurgery|Novalis Tx]] [[radiosurgery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcyberknife.com/comparison.htm |title=Radiosurgery treatment comparisons \u2013 Cyberknife, Gamma knife, Novalis Tx |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520230154/http://www.sdcyberknife.com/comparison.htm |archive-date=20 May 2007  }}</ref>{{medrs|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] is the most common treatment for secondary brain tumors.

Although chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients with the most malignant primary brain tumors, it does so in only about 20 percent of patients. [[Chemotherapy]] is often used in young children instead of radiation, as radiation may have negative effects on the developing brain. The decision to prescribe this treatment is based on a patient's overall health, type of tumor, and extent of the cancer. The toxicity and many side effects of the drugs, and the uncertain outcome of chemotherapy in brain tumors puts this treatment further down the line of treatment options with surgery and radiation therapy preferred.\n\nUCLA Neuro-Oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.

Brainstem gliomas have the poorest prognosis of any form of brain cancer, with most patients dying within one year, even with therapy that typically consists of radiation to the tumor along with [[corticosteroid]]s.

His military exploits over his five-decade career earned him a reputation as one of the greatest generals in [[Early modern period|modern history]].\n\nBorn to a [[Huguenot]] family, the son of a [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Marshal of France]], he was introduced to the art of war at a young age. He first served as a volunteer in the [[Dutch States Army]] under the orders of his maternal uncles [[Maurice of Nassau]] and [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]] but his regular stints in the french royal court eventually earned him the patronage of [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. He thus chose to continue his military career in the service of France, where his noble origins and proven qualities soon saw him rise to the top of the military hierarchy. He rose to prominence during the [[Thirty Years' War]] by [[Battle of Breisach|capturing the fortress of Breisach]] in 1638. Promoted [[Marshal of France]] in 1643, he invaded [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] the following year, defeating the Bavarian army in three years of campaigning and forcing the [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] to make peace. The Elector soon broke the treaty and in 1648 Turenne invaded again with [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] support, subduing the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army at [[Battle of Zusmarshausen|Zusmarshausen]] and pacifying Bavaria.\n\nTurenne initially supported the [[Fronde]] but returned to Royal service in 1651, emerging as France's foremost general by defeating the rebellious army of the [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]] on the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine|outskirts]] of Paris and re-occupying the city. \nHis triumphs against [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] armies at [[Battle of Arras (1654)|Arras]] (1654) and at [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Dunkirk]] (1658) led to the overrunning of much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and brought the war against Spain to a victorious conclusion. Two years later, [[Louis XIV]] appointed him Marshal General of France. A supporter of [[absolute monarchy]], he converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1668.\n\nDuring the [[War of Devolution]] in 1667 Turenne captured the Spanish Netherlands practically without resistance. In [[Rampjaar|1672]] the French [[Franco-Dutch War|invaded]] the [[Dutch Republic]] and the Marshal General conquered the country up to [[Amsterdam]]. Checked by the Dutch flooding of the land, he invaded the Holy Roman Empire the next year, reaching the [[Elbe]] and compelling [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to abandon the anti-French coalition. Faced with the loss of [[Alsace]] to superior Allied forces, he crowned his career with a series of battlefield victories, most notably at [[Battle of Turckheim|Turckheim]] (1675) and a masterful strategic [[Turenne's Winter Campaign|turning movement]] around the [[Vosges]] in mid-winter that drove the Imperials from Alsace. He was killed by an Imperial cannonball at the battle of [[Battle of Salzbach|Salzbach]] in 1675.\n\n==Background and early career==\n[[File:Armoiries Turenne Chantilly.jpg|thumb|left|Turenne's coat of arms in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly]]]]\nThe second son of [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon]], sovereign [[Prince of Sedan]], by his second wife [[Elisabeth of Nassau|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[William the Silent]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-de-La-Tour-dAuvergne-vicomte-de-Turenne|title=Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne {{!}} French military leader|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Turenne,_Henri_de_la_Tour_d%27Auvergne,_Vicomte_de|title=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Turenne, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de - Wikisource, the free online library|website=en.m.wikisource.org|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/historyhenridel00mousgoog|title=The history of Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, viscount de Turenne, marshal-general of France ..|last=Ramsey|first=Andrew Michael|last2=James II|first2=King of England|last3=La Moussaye|first3=Fran\u00e7ois de Goyon de Matignon|last4=Pre-1801 Imprint Collection (Library of Congress) DLC|date=1735|publisher=London, Printed by J.

Turenne displayed the personal bravery of a young soldier at [[Jargeau]] (28 March 1652), the skill and wariness of a veteran general at [[Gien]] (7 April), and he practically crushed the civil war in the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine]] (2 July) and in the re-occupation of Paris (21 October).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n== Against Spain ==\n[[File:James II by John Riley.png|thumb|left|The duke of York and future [[James II of England|king James of England]]]]\nTurenne still needed to deal with Cond\u00e9, who was fighting alongside the Spaniards,<ref name=\":5\" /> however, and the long drawn-out campaigns of the \"Spanish Fronde\" gave ample scope for the display of scientific generalship on the part of both the famous captains.

He had offered to revive the office of [[Constable of France]] (suppressed in 1627) in Turenne's favour if the marshal would become a Roman Catholic. Turenne declined. Born of [[Calvinist]] parents and educated a Protestant, he had refused to marry one of Richelieu's nieces in 1639 and subsequently rejected a similar proposal from Mazarin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n[[File:LeBrun Louis XIV at Douai in the War of Devolution 1667.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV]] visiting a trench during the [[War of Devolution]]]]\n\nTurenne married in 1652 Charlotte de Caumont, a daughter of the Protestant Marshal [[Armand-Nompar de Caumont, duc de la Force|de la Force]], to whom he remained deeply attached. But he sincerely deplored the division of Christianity into two hostile camps. He had always distrusted the influence of many dissident and uncontrolled [[sect]]s; the history of independence in the English army and people made a deep impression on his mind, and the same fear of indiscipline which drove the English [[Presbyterians]] into royalism drew Turenne more and more towards the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The letters between him and his wife show how closely both studied available evidence on the matter, and in the end, two years after her death, the eloquence of [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] and the persuasions of his nephew, the [[Cardinal de Bouillon]] prevailed upon him to give his adhesion to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith (October 1668). In 1667 he had returned to the more congenial air of the \"Camps and Armies of the King\", directing (nominally under Louis XIV) the famous ''Promenade militaire'' in which the French overran the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Soon afterwards Cond\u00e9, now reconciled with the king, rivaled Turenne's success by the rapid conquest of the [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]], shortly before the end the [[War of Devolution]] in February 1668.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n==The Dutch War==\n[[File:HGM Grie\u00dfler Montecuccoli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Raimondo Montecuccoli]]]]\nIn Louis XIV's [[Franco-Dutch War|Dutch War]] of 1672 Turenne accompanied the army commanded by the king which overran the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] up to the gates of [[Amsterdam]]. The terms offered by Louis to the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] only aroused a more bitter resistance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\nThe Dutch opened the [[dike (construction)|dike]]s and flooded the countryside around Amsterdam. This measure completely checked Turenne, whom the king had left in command. News of this event roused Europe to action, and the conflict spread to Germany. Turenne fought a successful war of manoeuvre on the middle Rhine while Cond\u00e9 covered Alsace.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\nIn January 1673 Turenne assumed the offensive, penetrated far into Germany, and forced the [[Great Elector]] of [[Brandenburg]] to make peace; later in the year, however, the famous imperial general [[Raimondo Montecuccoli|Montecuccoli]] completely outmanoeuvred Turenne: Montecuccoli evaded his opponent, joined the Dutch and took the important place of [[Bonn]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n[[File:BatallaTurckheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Turenne at the [[battle of Turckheim]]]]\n\nIn June 1674, Turenne won the [[battle of Sinzheim]], which made him master of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. Under orders from Paris the French wasted the country far and wide, and this devastation with the sack of T\u00fcrckheim usually counts as the gravest blot on Turenne's fame. In the autumn the anti-French allies again advanced, and though they again outmanoeuvred Turenne, the action of the neutral city of [[Strasbourg]] occasioned his failure by permitting the enemy to cross the Rhine by the bridge at that place. The [[battle of Enzheim]] followed; this proved a tactical victory, but hardly affected the situation, and, at the beginning of December, the allies remained in Alsace. The old marshal now made the most daring campaign of his career. A [[Turenne's Winter Campaign|swift and secret march]] in mid-winter from one end of the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] to the other took the allies by surprise. Sharply following up his first successes, Turenne drove the enemy to [[Battle of Turckeim|Turkheim]], and there inflicted upon them a heavy defeat (5 January 1675). As revenge for the active resistance the inhabitants of the city had shown, Turenne let his troops loot it and massacre the remaining population during two weeks. In a few weeks he had completely recovered Alsace.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n[[File:Muerte-de-turena.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Turenne's death at the [[battle of Salzbach]]]]\n\nIn the summer campaign he once more faced Montecuccoli, and after the highest display of \"strategic chess-moves\" by both commanders, Turenne finally compelled his opponent to offer battle at a disadvantage at [[Battle of Salzbach|Salzbach]]. There, on 27 July 1675, one of the first shots fired killed him. The news of his death produced universal sorrow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210043542/http://www.hdgbw.de/ausstellungen/dezentrale-ausstellungen/turenne-museum/|title=Turenne-Museum\u00a0{{!}}\u00a0Haus der Geschichte Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|date=2009-02-10|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n==Legacy==\nTurenne's most eloquent countrymen wrote his ''\u00e9loges'', and Montecucculi himself exclaimed, \"''II est mort aujourd'hui un homme qui faisait honneur \u00e0 l'homme''\" (A man is dead today who did honour to Man). His body, taken to [[Saint Denis Basilica|St Denis]], was buried with the Kings of France. Even the extreme revolutionists of 1793 respected it, and, while they ignominiously reburied the bodies of the monarchs in a mass grave, they preserved the remains of Turenne at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] until 22 September 1800, when Napoleon had them removed to the church of the [[Invalides]] at Paris, where they still rest.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\nNapoleon recommended all soldiers to \"read and re-read\" the campaigns of Turenne as one of the great captains.  His fame as a general rivalled that of any other in Europe at a period when the populace studied war more critically than ever before, for his military character epitomized the art of war of his time (Prince de Ligne). Strategic caution and logistic accuracy, combined with brilliant dash in small combats and constancy under all circumstances\u2014of success or failure\u2014perhaps emerge as the salient points of Turenne's genius for war. Great battles he avoided. \"Few sieges and many combats\" he used as his own maxim. And, unlike his great rival [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], who appeared as brilliant in his first battle as in his last, Turenne improved day by day. Napoleon said of him that, his genius grew bolder as it grew older, and a later author, the Duke of Aumale (''Histoire des princes de la maison de Cond\u00e9''), took the same view when he wrote: \"To know him, you must follow him up to Salzbach. In his case, every day signaled some progress\u201d.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=414}}\n\nIn his personal character Turenne showed little more than the nature of a simple and honourable soldier, endowed with much tact; but in the world of politics and intellect he seemed almost helpless in the hands of a skilful intriguer or casuist. His morals, if not beyond reproach, were at least more austere than those prevalent in the age in which he lived. He operated essentially as a commander of regular armies. He spent his life with the troops; he knew how to win their affection; he tempered a severe discipline with rare generosity, and his men loved him as a comrade no less than they admired him as a commander. Thus, though Cond\u00e9's genius appeared far more versatile, Turenne's genius best represents the art of war in the 17th century. For the small, costly, and highly trained regular armies, and for the dynastic warfare of the age of Louis XIV, Turenne functioned as the ideal army leader.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=414}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris - Les Invalides - Tombeau de Turenne - 001.jpg|Turennes's tomb in [[Les Invalides]]\nFile:Pajou Turenne statue Versailles.JPG|Statue of Turenne in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]\n</gallery>\n\n==In fiction==\nMarshal of France Turenne is depicted in several alternative history novels written by [[Eric Flint]] and [[David Weber]].

His military exploits over his five-decade career earned him a reputation as one of the greatest generals in [[Early modern period|modern history]].\n\nBorn to a [[Huguenot]] family, the son of a [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Marshal of France]], he was introduced to the art of war at a young age. He first served as a volunteer in the [[Dutch States Army]] under the orders of his maternal uncles [[Maurice of Nassau]] and [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]]. He thus chose to continue his military career in the service of France, where his noble origins and proven qualities soon saw him rise to the top of the military hierarchy. He rose to prominence during the [[Thirty Years' War]] by [[Battle of Breisach|capturing the fortress of Breisach]] in 1638. Promoted [[Marshal of France]] in 1643, he invaded [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] the following year, defeating the Bavarian army in three years of campaigning and forcing the [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] to make peace. The Elector soon broke the treaty and in 1648 Turenne invaded again with [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] support, subduing the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army at [[Battle of Zusmarshausen|Zusmarshausen]] and pacifying Bavaria.\n\nTurenne initially supported the [[Fronde]] but returned to Royal service in 1651, emerging as France's foremost general by defeating the rebellious army of the [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]] on the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine|outskirts]] of Paris and re-occupying the city. \nHis triumphs against [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] armies at [[Battle of Arras (1654)|Arras]] (1654) and at [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Dunkirk]] (1658) led to the overrunning of much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and brought the war against Spain to a victorious conclusion. Two years later, [[Louis XIV]] appointed him Marshal General of France. A supporter of [[absolute monarchy]], he converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1668.\n\nDuring the [[War of Devolution]] in 1667 Turenne captured the Spanish Netherlands practically without resistance. In [[Rampjaar|1672]] the French [[Franco-Dutch War|invaded]] the [[Dutch Republic]] and the Marshal General conquered the country up to [[Amsterdam]]. Checked by the Dutch flooding of the land, he invaded the Holy Roman Empire the next year, reaching the [[Elbe]] and compelling [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to abandon the anti-French coalition. Faced with the loss of [[Alsace]] to superior Allied forces, he crowned his career with a series of battlefield victories, most notably at [[Battle of Turckheim|Turckheim]] (1675) and a masterful strategic [[Turenne's Winter Campaign|turning movement]] around the [[Vosges]] in mid-winter that drove the Imperials from Alsace. He was killed by an Imperial cannonball at the battle of [[Battle of Salzbach|Salzbach]] in 1675.\n\n==Background and early career==\n[[File:Armoiries Turenne Chantilly.jpg|thumb|left|Turenne's coat of arms in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly]]]]\nThe second son of [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon]], sovereign [[Prince of Sedan]], by his second wife [[Elisabeth of Nassau|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[William the Silent]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-de-La-Tour-dAuvergne-vicomte-de-Turenne|title=Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne {{!}} French military leader|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Turenne,_Henri_de_la_Tour_d%27Auvergne,_Vicomte_de|title=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Turenne, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de - Wikisource, the free online library|website=en.m.wikisource.org|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/historyhenridel00mousgoog|title=The history of Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, viscount de Turenne, marshal-general of France ..|last=Ramsey|first=Andrew Michael|last2=James II|first2=King of England|last3=La Moussaye|first3=Fran\u00e7ois de Goyon de Matignon|last4=Pre-1801 Imprint Collection (Library of Congress) DLC|date=1735|publisher=London, Printed by J.

Turenne displayed the personal bravery of a young soldier at [[Jargeau]] (28 March 1652), the skill and wariness of a veteran general at [[Gien]] (7 April), and he practically crushed the civil war in the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine]] (2 July) and in the re-occupation of Paris (21 October).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n== Against Spain ==\n[[File:James II by John Riley.png|thumb|left|The duke of York and future [[James II of England|king James of England]]]]\nTurenne still needed to deal with Cond\u00e9, who was fighting alongside the Spaniards,<ref name=\":5\" /> however, and the long drawn-out campaigns of the \"Spanish Fronde\" gave ample scope for the display of scientific generalship on the part of both the famous captains.

He had offered to revive the office of [[Constable of France]] (suppressed in 1627) in Turenne's favour if the marshal would become a Roman Catholic. Turenne declined. Born of [[Calvinist]] parents and educated a Protestant, he had refused to marry one of Richelieu's nieces in 1639 and subsequently rejected a similar proposal from Mazarin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n[[File:LeBrun Louis XIV at Douai in the War of Devolution 1667.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV]] visiting a trench during the [[War of Devolution]]]]\n\nTurenne married in 1652 Charlotte de Caumont, a daughter of the Protestant Marshal [[Armand-Nompar de Caumont, duc de la Force|de la Force]], to whom he remained deeply attached. But he sincerely deplored the division of Christianity into two hostile camps. He had always distrusted the influence of many dissident and uncontrolled [[sect]]s; the history of independence in the English army and people made a deep impression on his mind, and the same fear of indiscipline which drove the English [[Presbyterians]] into royalism drew Turenne more and more towards the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The letters between him and his wife show how closely both studied available evidence on the matter, and in the end, two years after her death, the eloquence of [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] and the persuasions of his nephew, the [[Cardinal de Bouillon]] prevailed upon him to give his adhesion to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith (October 1668). In 1667 he had returned to the more congenial air of the \"Camps and Armies of the King\", directing (nominally under Louis XIV) the famous ''Promenade militaire'' in which the French overran the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Soon afterwards Cond\u00e9, now reconciled with the king, rivaled Turenne's success by the rapid conquest of the [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]], shortly before the end the [[War of Devolution]] in February 1668.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n==The Dutch War==\n[[File:HGM Grie\u00dfler Montecuccoli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Raimondo Montecuccoli]]]]\nIn Louis XIV's [[Franco-Dutch War|Dutch War]] of 1672 Turenne accompanied the army commanded by the king which overran the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] up to the gates of [[Amsterdam]]. The terms offered by Louis to the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] only aroused a more bitter resistance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\nThe Dutch opened the [[dike (construction)|dike]]s and flooded the countryside around Amsterdam. This measure completely checked Turenne, whom the king had left in command. News of this event roused Europe to action, and the conflict spread to Germany. Turenne fought a successful war of manoeuvre on the middle Rhine while Cond\u00e9 covered Alsace.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\nIn January 1673 Turenne assumed the offensive, penetrated far into Germany, and forced the [[Great Elector]] of [[Brandenburg]] to make peace; later in the year, however, the famous imperial general [[Raimondo Montecuccoli|Montecuccoli]] completely outmanoeuvred Turenne: Montecuccoli evaded his opponent, joined the Dutch and took the important place of [[Bonn]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n[[File:BatallaTurckheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Turenne at the [[battle of Turckheim]]]]\n\nIn June 1674, Turenne won the [[battle of Sinzheim]], which made him master of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. Under orders from Paris the French wasted the country far and wide, and this devastation with the sack of T\u00fcrckheim usually counts as the gravest blot on Turenne's fame. In the autumn the anti-French allies again advanced, and though they again outmanoeuvred Turenne, the action of the neutral city of [[Strasbourg]] occasioned his failure by permitting the enemy to cross the Rhine by the bridge at that place. The [[battle of Enzheim]] followed; this proved a tactical victory, but hardly affected the situation, and, at the beginning of December, the allies remained in Alsace. The old marshal now made the most daring campaign of his career. A [[Turenne's Winter Campaign|swift and secret march]] in mid-winter from one end of the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] to the other took the allies by surprise. Sharply following up his first successes, Turenne drove the enemy to [[Battle of Turckeim|Turkheim]], and there inflicted upon them a heavy defeat (5 January 1675). As revenge for the active resistance the inhabitants of the city had shown, Turenne let his troops loot it and massacre the remaining population during two weeks. In a few weeks he had completely recovered Alsace.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n[[File:Muerte-de-turena.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Turenne's death at the [[battle of Salzbach]]]]\n\nIn the summer campaign he once more faced Montecuccoli, and after the highest display of \"strategic chess-moves\" by both commanders, Turenne finally compelled his opponent to offer battle at a disadvantage at [[Battle of Salzbach|Salzbach]]. There, on 27 July 1675, one of the first shots fired killed him. The news of his death produced universal sorrow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210043542/http://www.hdgbw.de/ausstellungen/dezentrale-ausstellungen/turenne-museum/|title=Turenne-Museum\u00a0{{!}}\u00a0Haus der Geschichte Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|date=2009-02-10|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\n==Legacy==\nTurenne's most eloquent countrymen wrote his ''\u00e9loges'', and Montecucculi himself exclaimed, \"''II est mort aujourd'hui un homme qui faisait honneur \u00e0 l'homme''\" (A man is dead today who did honour to Man). His body, taken to [[Saint Denis Basilica|St Denis]], was buried with the Kings of France. Even the extreme revolutionists of 1793 respected it, and, while they ignominiously reburied the bodies of the monarchs in a mass grave, they preserved the remains of Turenne at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] until 22 September 1800, when Napoleon had them removed to the church of the [[Invalides]] at Paris, where they still rest.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=413}}\n\nNapoleon recommended all soldiers to \"read and re-read\" the campaigns of Turenne as one of the great captains.  His fame as a general rivalled that of any other in Europe at a period when the populace studied war more critically than ever before, for his military character epitomized the art of war of his time (Prince de Ligne). Strategic caution and logistic accuracy, combined with brilliant dash in small combats and constancy under all circumstances\u2014of success or failure\u2014perhaps emerge as the salient points of Turenne's genius for war. Great battles he avoided. \"Few sieges and many combats\" he used as his own maxim. And, unlike his great rival [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], who appeared as brilliant in his first battle as in his last, Turenne improved day by day. Napoleon said of him that, his genius grew bolder as it grew older, and a later author, the Duke of Aumale (''Histoire des princes de la maison de Cond\u00e9''), took the same view when he wrote: \"To know him, you must follow him up to Salzbach. In his case, every day signaled some progress\u201d.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=414}}\n\nIn his personal character Turenne showed little more than the nature of a simple and honourable soldier, endowed with much tact; but in the world of politics and intellect he seemed almost helpless in the hands of a skilful intriguer or casuist. His morals, if not beyond reproach, were at least more austere than those prevalent in the age in which he lived. He operated essentially as a commander of regular armies. He spent his life with the troops; he knew how to win their affection; he tempered a severe discipline with rare generosity, and his men loved him as a comrade no less than they admired him as a commander. Thus, though Cond\u00e9's genius appeared far more versatile, Turenne's genius best represents the art of war in the 17th century. For the small, costly, and highly trained regular armies, and for the dynastic warfare of the age of Louis XIV, Turenne functioned as the ideal army leader.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=414}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris - Les Invalides - Tombeau de Turenne - 001.jpg|Turennes's tomb in [[Les Invalides]]\nFile:Pajou Turenne statue Versailles.JPG|Statue of Turenne in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]\n</gallery>\n\n==In fiction==\nMarshal of France Turenne is depicted in several alternative history novels written by [[Eric Flint]] and [[David Weber]].

The Romans were commanded by the [[proconsul]] [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], the Thalans by an unknown Numidian commander. The Romans main objective was to capture the Numidian king Jugurtha who was reported to be in Thala, but he escaped before the legions reached the fortress town. Metellus then besieged the town to get hold of one of Jugurtha's treasuries which was stored in Thala. The fortress town was besieged for forty days after which most of its inhabitants committed suicide by setting fire to the town. \n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\nKing [[Masinissa]] of Numidia, who was a steadfast ally of Rome, died in 149, he was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled from 149 to 118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the [[siege of Numantia]], where he had formed a friendship with Roman aristocrats and learned about Roman society and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that after his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha. After Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the division Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins. Hiempsal, the younger and braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents. Jugurtha gathered an army and marched against Adherbal, who fled to Rome. There he appealed to the [[Roman Senate]] for arbitration.\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants in 116 BC. Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission and was alloted the more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east. Powerless Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital. Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Romans and Italians who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta. But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC.\n\nIn 111 BC the consul [[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]] commanded a Roman army against Jugurtha, but he allowed himself to be bribed. The following year the consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] succeeded the command against the Numidian king, but he let himself be bribed too. Spurius's brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus|Aulus Postumius Albinus]], allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.\n\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, men like [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]]. Metellus arrived in Africa as consul in 109 BC and dedicated several months to a serious disciplinary reform of his demoralised forces.\n\nIn spring of 109 BC, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated.

The Romans were commanded by the [[proconsul]] [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], the Thalans by an unknown Numidian commander. The Romans main objective was to capture the Numidian king Jugurtha who was reported to be in Thala, but he escaped before the legions reached the fortress town. Metellus then besieged the town to get hold of one of Jugurtha's treasuries which was stored in Thala. The fortress town was besieged for forty days after which most of its inhabitants committed suicide by setting fire to the town. \n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\nKing [[Masinissa]] of Numidia, who was a steadfast ally of Rome, died in 149, he was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled from 149 to 118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the [[siege of Numantia]], where he had formed a friendship with Roman aristocrats and learned about Roman society and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that after his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha. After Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the division Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins. Hiempsal, the younger and braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents. Jugurtha gathered an army and marched against Adherbal, who fled to Rome. There he appealed to the [[Roman Senate]] for arbitration.\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants in 116 BC. Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission and was alloted the more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east. Powerless Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital. Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Romans and Italians who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta. But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC.\n\nIn 111 BC the consul [[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]] commanded a Roman army against Jugurtha, but he allowed himself to be bribed. The following year the consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] succeeded the command against the Numidian king, but he let himself be bribed too. Spurius's brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus|Aulus Postumius Albinus]], allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.\n\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, men like [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]]. Metellus arrived in Africa as consul in 109 BC and dedicated several months to a serious disciplinary reform of his demoralised forces.\nIn spring of 109 BC, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated. Metellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul where the Numidians ambushed them. Through the capable leadership of Metellus, Marius and Rutilius Rufus the Romans won an indecisive victory at the [[Battle of the Muthul]].\n\n==Prelude==\nSome time after the Battle of the Muthul, Metellus' agents and scouts located Jugurtha's army again and the Romans were able to catch up with the Numidians \u2013 who were not anticipating their arrival \u2013 and forced a battle.

He is best known for playing the character [[Frank Spencer (Michael Crawford)|Frank Spencer]] in a popular 1970s sitcom titled ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', which first made him a household name, as well as for originating [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|the title role]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. His performance in the latter musical drama earned him both the [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical]] and [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical]].<ref name=\"Trust\"/>\n\nCrawford has also published the autobiographical work ''Parcel Arrived Safely: Tied With String'', which covers the changes in his career over the multiple decades. Since 1987, he has served as the leader of [[the Sick Children's Trust]] as well and acted as a public face for the British [[Nonprofit organization|social cause organization]].<ref name=\"Trust\">{{cite web|website=BroadwayWorld.com|title=Michael Crawford to Host Afternoon Tea in Cambridge for Sick Children's Trust|date=6 September 2015|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Michael-Crawford-to-Host-Afternoon-Tea-in-Cambridge-for-Sick-Childrens-Trust-20150906|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCrawford was brought up by his mother, Doris Agnes Mary Pike, and her parents, Montague Pike and his wife, Edith (n\u00e9e O'Keefe), in what Crawford described as a \"close-knit Roman Catholic family\".

The isle was where his mother had grown up and where Crawford would later live with his mother and maternal grandparents. He attended St Michael's, a Catholic school in [[Bexleyheath]] which was run by nuns who Crawford later described as not being shy in their use of corporal punishment. At the end of the [[Second World War]], his mother remarried, this time to a grocer, Lionel Dennis \"Den\" Ingram. The couple moved to London, where Crawford attended [[Oakfield Preparatory School]], Dulwich, where he was known as '''Michael Ingram'''. His mother's second marriage was abusive, according to Crawford.<ref>[http://www.mcifa.com/parcel2.cfm Crawford website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Beginning===\nHe made his first stage appearance in the role of Sammy the Little Sweep in his school production of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Let's Make an Opera]]'', conducted by [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]],<ref name=Mitchell28>{{cite book | last= Mitchell | first= Donald, Reed, Philip & Cooke, Mervyn (eds) | year=2004 | title= Letters from a Life: Selected Letters of Benjamin Britten, Vol 3, 1946\u20131951 | location=London | publisher=Faber and Faber | isbn=978-0571222827 }}: p. 28</ref> which was then transferred to [[Brixton]] Town Hall in London. He auditioned, unsuccessfully, for the role of Miles in Britten's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' - the role being given to another boy soprano, [[David Hemmings]]; but it appears that Crawford's audition sufficiently impressed Britten as in 1955 he hired him to play Sammy, alternating with David Hemmings, in another production of ''Let's Make an Opera'', this time at the [[Scala Theatre]] in London.<ref name=mitchell27>Mitchell (2004): p. 27</ref> He also participated in the recording of that opera (as Michael Ingram, singing the role of Gay Brook) made that same year, conducted by the composer.<ref name=mitchell27/><ref>Booklet details from Decca 436 393\u20132</ref> Then in 1958 he was hired by the [[English Opera Group]] to create the role of Jaffet in another Britten opera, ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'', based on the story of Noah and the Great Flood.<ref name=Mitchell28/> Crawford remembers that it was while working in this production that he realised he seriously wanted to become an actor. It was in between performances of ''Let's Make an Opera'' and ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' that he was advised to change his name, \"to avoid confusion with a television newsman called Michael Ingram[s] who was registered with [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]]\".<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nHe went on to perform in a wide repertoire. Among his stage work, he performed in [[Andr\u00e9 Birabeau]]'s French comedy ''[[Head of the Family]]'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Come Blow Your Horn]]'', [[Bernard Kops]]'s ''Change for the Angel'', [[Francis Swann]]'s ''Out of the Frying Pan'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', ''The Striplings'', ''The Move After Checkmate'' and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as ''[[Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (TV series)|Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School]]'', ''[[Emergency - Ward 10]]'', ''[[Probation Officer]]'', and ''[[Two Living, One Dead]]''. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series ''[[Sir Francis Drake (television)|Sir Francis Drake]]'', a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring [[Terence Morgan]] and [[Jean Kent]]. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children's films, ''Blow Your Own Trumpet'' and ''Soapbox Derby'', for The [[Children's Film Foundation]] in Britain.<ref>{{cite news | last =Herincx | first =Gareth  | title =Entertainment: Crawford comes clean  | work= [[BBC News]]  | date =16 September 1999 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/448037.stm | accessdate =2 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Michael Crawford appeared in an episode of ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]]'' called \"The Villa\" in which he played a character experimenting with strobe lights. Crawford appears in the only surviving episode of the 1960 British crime series ''[[Police Surgeon (UK TV series)|Police Surgeon]]'' alongside [[Ian Hendry]]. This series would spawn the much better-known ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.\n\n===Early adult career===\nAt age nineteen, he was approached to play an American, Junior Sailen, in the film ''[[The War Lover]]'' (1962), which starred [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]]. To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to [[Woody Woodbury]], a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After ''[[The War Lover]]'', Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film ''[[Two Left Feet (film)|Two Left Feet]]'', was offered a role in the British television series, ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'', as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director [[Richard Lester]] to hire him for the role of Colin in ''[[The Knack \u2026and How to Get It]]'' in 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.\n\nLester also cast him in the [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', and ''[[How I Won the War]]'', which starred [[Roy Kinnear]] and [[John Lennon]] (during the filming of which he lived in London with Lennon and his first wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], and Gabrielle Lewis).<ref>As told to [[Matt Baker (television personality)|Matt Baker]] and [[Alex Jones (Welsh presenter)|Alex Jones]] on the [[BBC]] show \"[[The One Show]]\" on 1 August 2011.</ref> Crawford starred in ''[[The Jokers]]'' (directed by [[Michael Winner]]) with [[Oliver Reed]] in 1967.\n\n===Broadway debut===\nIn 1967, he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] d\u00e9but in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Black Comedy (play)|Black Comedy]]'' with [[Lynn Redgrave]] (making her d\u00e9but as well) in which he demonstrated his aptitude and daring for extreme physical comedy, such as walking into walls and falling down staircases. While working in the show, he was noticed by [[Gene Kelly]] and was called to Hollywood to audition for him for a part in the [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|film adaptation]] of the musical ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''. He was cast and shared top billing with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. Despite becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1969, it failed to recoup its $25&nbsp;million budget at the box office. It went on to win three [[Academy Awards]], was nominated for a further four (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), and is now considered to be one of the greatest musical films ever.<ref>{{Cite web|title =100 Greatest Film Musicals|url = http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_musicals.php|accessdate = 7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best Movie Musicals of All Time |url=http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221130312/http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |archivedate=21 February 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top 100 Greatest Movie Musicals of All Time|url = http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time/|accessdate = 7 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206232128/http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time|archive-date = 6 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nHis later films fared less successfully, although ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1972 film)|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', in which he played the White Rabbit, enjoyed moderate success in the UK. After performing in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and with offers of work greatly reduced and much of his salary from ''Hello, Dolly!'' lost, reportedly due to underhanded investments by his agent,<ref name=\"parcel\">{{cite book|url=http://www.mcifa.com/parcel3.cfm|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Parcel Arrived Safely, Tied with String|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> Crawford faced a brief period of unemployment, in which he helped his wife stuff cushions (for their upholstery business) and took a job as an office clerk in an electric company to pass the time between. During this difficult time, his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1975.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em''===\nCrawford's acting career took off again after he appeared on the London stage in the farce ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'', in which he played the part of frantic chief cashier Brian Runnicles. His performance led to an invitation to star in a [[BBC]] television comedy series about a childlike and eternally haphazard man who causes disaster everywhere he goes. Crawford was not the first choice for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''. Originally, the part had been offered to comedy actor [[Ronnie Barker]] but after he and [[Norman Wisdom]] had turned it down, Crawford took on the challenge, adopting a similar characterisation to that which he used when playing Brian Runnicles. Cast alongside him was actress [[Michele Dotrice]] in the role of Frank's long-suffering wife, Betty, and the series premiered in 1973.\n\n''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'' soon became one of the [[BBC]]'s most popular television series. Initially, only two series were produced, from 1973 to 1975, while the show's creators felt that it should stop while at its peak. There was a brief hiatus until popular demand saw it revived for a final series in 1978. The immense popularity that followed the sitcom was due perhaps to the unusual amount of physical comedy involved. Crawford said he had always been a fan of comedians such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], as well as the great sight gags employed in the days of silent film, and saw ''Some Mothers'' as the ideal opportunity to use such humour himself. He performed all of his own stunts during the show's run, and never used a double.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nWhile he was playing in ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford was approached to star in the musical ''[[Billy (musical)|Billy]]'' (based on the novel ''[[Billy Liar]]''), which opened in 1974 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. This was his first leading man role on the West End stage and helped to cement his career as both a singer and showman. The part was demanding, requiring proficiency in both song and dance, and in preparation for the role, Crawford began taking both more seriously, studying singing under the tutelage of vocal coach Ian Adam and spending hours perfecting his dancing capabilities with choreographer [[Onna White]].<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Billy'' gave the many fans of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer an opportunity to see him in a broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in ''[[Charlie and Algernon|Flowers for Algernon]]'' (1979) in the role of Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on a very short-lived ITV sitcom, ''[[Chalk and Cheese]]'', as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go over well with his fans: the popularity of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]], to the extent that they could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n\n====''Condorman''====\nCrawford starred in the 1981 Disney comedy/adventure film ''[[Condorman]]'', playing an eccentric American comic book writer and illustrator named Woody Wilkins who is asked by his friend at the [[CIA]] to help a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] woman to defect while acting out the fantasy of bringing his comic book creation, Condorman, to life.<ref>\n{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Condorman(1981)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082199|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Critics panned the film. On their television show, critics [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]] featured the film in their round-up of the year's worst films pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman in the air and the obvious bluescreen effect. The film performed poorly at the box office but years later gained a [[cult following]] among Disney fans.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n====''Barnum''====\nAlso in 1981, Crawford starred in the original London production of [[Cy Coleman]]'s ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' (1981) as the illustrious American showman [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]. He trained at the ''Big Apple Circus School'' in New York City to prepare for the ambitious stunts, learning to walk the tight-rope, juggle and slide down a rope from the rafters of the theatre. After further training for the second opening of ''Barnum'', he was awarded a British Amateur Gymnastics Association badge and certificate as a qualified coach.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Barnum'' opened on 11 June 1981 at the [[London Palladium]], where it ran for 655 performances. Crawford and [[Deborah Grant]] headed the cast. It was well-received, becoming a favourite of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as well as the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]]. Crawford earned his first [[Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical on the London stage. After the initial production of the show, he worked extensively with [[Torvill and Dean]], and can be seen rinkside with them as they received their \"perfect six\" marks in the 1983 world championships for their 'Barnum' routine.<ref>{{YouTube|o2UkD0tGitI|Crawford with Torvill & Dean receiving marks at World championships 1983}}</ref><ref>Hennessey, John. ''Torvill & Dean; David & Charles'' (1983); {{ISBN|0-7153-8476-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 a revival of ''Barnum'' opened in [[Manchester]] at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]], ending the tour at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]] in the West End. In 1986 this production, with a new cast, though still headed by Crawford, was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC. Crawford's ''Barnum'' is one of the longest runs by a leading actor.\n\n====''The Phantom of the Opera''====\nIn 1984, at the final preview of ''[[Starlight Express]]'', Crawford happened to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in ''Flowers for Algernon''. He informed Crawford that he was working on a new project based on a [[Gaston Leroux]] novel and wanted to know whether he was interested. Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided. Several months passed, during which Lloyd Webber had already created a pitch video featuring his then-wife [[Sarah Brightman]] as the female lead Christine, and British rocker [[Steve Harley]] as the Phantom, singing the title song in the manner of a contemporary [[New wave music|new wave]] video. Crawford was turned off by that, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a \"rock opera\"-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nSince casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber had also begun to regret his artistic choices. As production continued on the show, the bulk of the score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due in large part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear Crawford practising the aria ''Care Selve'', from the opera ''Atalanta'' by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber asked Ian Adam who his student was. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired virtually on the spot.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nMany critics were sceptical; Crawford was still largely pigeonholed as the hapless Frank Spencer, and questions were asked about Crawford's ability to manage such a vocally and dramatically demanding role. In 1986, he began his performance in London at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], continuing on to Broadway in 1988, and then Los Angeles in 1989. He played the role for two and a half years and over 1,300 performances, winning an [[Olivier Award]] (Best Actor in a Musical), a [[Tony Award]] (Best Performance by an Actor in a Lead Role, Musical), a New York [[Drama Desk Award]], and a [[Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award]] for Distinguished Achievement in Theatre (Lead Performance).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcifa.com/biography.cfm|title=biography, timeline|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the run of ''Phantom'' in Los Angeles, Crawford was asked to perform \"[[The Music of the Night]]\" at the Inaugural Gala for President [[George H. W. Bush]] in Washington, D.C., on 19 January 1989. At the gala, Crawford was presented with a birthday cake (it was his 47th birthday). On 29 April 1990, after three and a half years and over 1,300 performances later, Crawford left the show. He admits to having been saddened at his departure, and, during the final Lair scene, altered the Phantom's line to \"Christine....I ''loved'' you...\", acknowledging that this was his final performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-30/local/me-82_1_michael-crawford|title='Phantom' Departs Amid Cheers, Tears|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 April 1990|last1=Braxton|first1=Greg}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nAt the request of Liz Kirschner, wife of film producer [[David Kirschner]], he obtained the role of Cornelius in [[20th Century Fox]]'s animated film ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', which was produced by her husband. During his voice over sessions, Michael stated that he had a terrible time singing one of the musical numbers called \"Please Wake Up\". This was because he had to struggle not to cry when this was being completed, as the scenario was that his character Cornelius was singing to a child who was on the verge of death. The film was released in cinemas over the summer of 1993. 1993 also saw the release of his special, ''A Touch of Music in the Night'', to coincide with the release of his new album of the same name. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, Crawford created the high-profile starring role in ''[[EFX (show)|EFX]]'', the US$70&nbsp;million production which officially opened the 1,700-seat [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The Atlantic Theater label released the companion album to EFX. Early into the run, Crawford suffered an accident during a performance (which involved him sliding from a wire hanger from the back of the theatre all the way to the stage and then jumping down {{convert|12|ft|m}} to the stage itself) and left the show to recover from his injury, which resulted in an early hip replacement operation.<ref>''Weekend Wogan'', 25 September 2011</ref>\n\n===2000s to present===\nCrawford had a short comeback to Broadway as the Count von Krolock in the short-lived musical ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)|Dance of the Vampires]]'' (2002\u201303). He originated the role of the morbidly obese Count Fosco in Lloyd Webber's ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]'', which opened at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], London in September 2004. However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance. He spent several months recuperating and was thus unable to reprise the role on Broadway.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Interview with Michael Crawford|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/An_Interview_with_Michael_Crawford_20060106|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> He learned he was suffering from the post-viral condition [[myalgic encephalopathy|myalgic encephalomyelitis]] (ME), which debilitated him for six years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Michael Crawford on his long-awaited return to the stage|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1347273/Michael-Crawford-long-awaited-return-stage.html|accessdate=16 January 2011|location=London|work=Daily Mail|date=16 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, in the television poll [[100 Greatest Britons]], he was voted the Greatest living Briton, and the seventeenth overall.\n\nHe moved to New Zealand, both to be near his daughter and her family in Australia<ref>{{cite web|last=Moran |first=Jonathon |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/the-secret-life-of-a-phantom-star/story-e6frfmqi-1226296026514 |title=The secret life of a Phantom star |publisher=News.com.au [accessed from [[archive.is]] web page] |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120310202157/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/the-secret-life-of-a-phantom-star/story-e6frfmqi-1226296026514 |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}</ref> and to convalesce from his illness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/lifestyle-news/nostalgia-history-midlands/2012/03/11/play-it-again-michael-crawford-on-the-day-he-ended-up-on-spaghetti-junction-in-his-pyjamas-66331-30500070|title=Play it Again: Michael Crawford on the day he ended up on Spaghetti Junction in his pyjamas.|newspaper=Sunday Mercury|accessdate=8 May 2012|date=11 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Crawford attended the Gala Performance of the stage version of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' on Broadway at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] to celebrate the show's becoming the longest-running musical in Broadway history (surpassing the run of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'').

The isle was where his mother had grown up and where Crawford would later live with his mother and maternal grandparents. He attended St Michael's, a Catholic school in [[Bexleyheath]] which was run by nuns who Crawford later described as not being shy in their use of corporal punishment. At the end of the [[Second World War]], his mother remarried, this time to a grocer, Lionel Dennis \"Den\" Ingram. The couple moved to London, where Crawford attended [[Oakfield Preparatory School]], Dulwich, where he was known as '''Michael Ingram'''. His mother's second marriage was abusive, according to Crawford.<ref>[http://www.mcifa.com/parcel2.cfm Crawford website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Beginning===\nHe made his first stage appearance in the role of Sammy the Little Sweep in his school production of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Let's Make an Opera]]'', conducted by [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]],<ref name=Mitchell28>{{cite book | last= Mitchell | first= Donald, Reed, Philip & Cooke, Mervyn (eds) | year=2004 | title= Letters from a Life: Selected Letters of Benjamin Britten, Vol 3, 1946\u20131951 | location=London | publisher=Faber and Faber | isbn=978-0571222827 }}: p. 28</ref> which was then transferred to [[Brixton]] Town Hall in London. He auditioned, unsuccessfully, for the role of Miles in Britten's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' - the role being given to another boy soprano, [[David Hemmings]]; but it appears that Crawford's audition sufficiently impressed Britten as in 1955 he hired him to play Sammy, alternating with David Hemmings, in another production of ''Let's Make an Opera'', this time at the [[Scala Theatre]] in London.<ref name=mitchell27>Mitchell (2004): p. 27</ref> He also participated in the recording of that opera (as Michael Ingram, singing the role of Gay Brook) made that same year, conducted by the composer.<ref name=mitchell27/><ref>Booklet details from Decca 436 393\u20132</ref> Then in 1958 he was hired by the [[English Opera Group]] to create the role of Jaffet in another Britten opera, ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'', based on the story of Noah and the Great Flood.<ref name=Mitchell28/> Crawford remembers that it was while working in this production that he realised he seriously wanted to become an actor. It was in between performances of ''Let's Make an Opera'' and ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' that he was advised to change his name, \"to avoid confusion with a television newsman called Michael Ingram[s] who was registered with British Equity\".<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nHe went on to perform in a wide repertoire. Among his stage work, he performed in [[Andr\u00e9 Birabeau]]'s French comedy ''[[Head of the Family]]'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Come Blow Your Horn]]'', [[Bernard Kops]]'s ''Change for the Angel'', [[Francis Swann]]'s ''Out of the Frying Pan'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', ''The Striplings'', ''The Move After Checkmate'' and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as ''[[Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (TV series)|Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School]]'', ''[[Emergency - Ward 10]]'', ''[[Probation Officer]]'', and ''[[Two Living, One Dead]]''. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series ''[[Sir Francis Drake (television)|Sir Francis Drake]]'', a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring [[Terence Morgan]] and [[Jean Kent]]. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children's films, ''Blow Your Own Trumpet'' and ''Soapbox Derby'', for The [[Children's Film Foundation]] in Britain.<ref>{{cite news | last =Herincx | first =Gareth  | title =Entertainment: Crawford comes clean  | work= [[BBC News]]  | date =16 September 1999 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/448037.stm | accessdate =2 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Michael Crawford appeared in an episode of ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]]'' called \"The Villa\" in which he played a character experimenting with strobe lights. Crawford appears in the only surviving episode of the 1960 British crime series ''[[Police Surgeon (UK TV series)|Police Surgeon]]'' alongside [[Ian Hendry]]. This series would spawn the much better-known ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.\n\n===Early adult career===\nAt age nineteen, he was approached to play an American, Junior Sailen, in the film ''[[The War Lover]]'' (1962), which starred [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]]. To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to [[Woody Woodbury]], a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After ''[[The War Lover]]'', Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film ''[[Two Left Feet (film)|Two Left Feet]]'', was offered a role in the British television series, ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'', as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director [[Richard Lester]] to hire him for the role of Colin in ''[[The Knack \u2026and How to Get It]]'' in 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.\n\nLester also cast him in the [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', and ''[[How I Won the War]]'', which starred [[Roy Kinnear]] and [[John Lennon]] (during the filming of which he lived in London with Lennon and his first wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], and Gabrielle Lewis).<ref>As told to [[Matt Baker (television personality)|Matt Baker]] and [[Alex Jones (Welsh presenter)|Alex Jones]] on the [[BBC]] show \"[[The One Show]]\" on 1 August 2011.</ref> Crawford starred in ''[[The Jokers]]'' (directed by [[Michael Winner]]) with [[Oliver Reed]] in 1967.\n\n===Broadway debut===\nIn 1967, he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] d\u00e9but in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Black Comedy (play)|Black Comedy]]'' with [[Lynn Redgrave]] (making her d\u00e9but as well) in which he demonstrated his aptitude and daring for extreme physical comedy, such as walking into walls and falling down staircases. While working in the show, he was noticed by [[Gene Kelly]] and was called to Hollywood to audition for him for a part in the [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|film adaptation]] of the musical ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''. He was cast and shared top billing with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. Despite becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1969, it failed to recoup its $25&nbsp;million budget at the box office. It went on to win three [[Academy Awards]], was nominated for a further four (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), and is now considered to be one of the greatest musical films ever.<ref>{{Cite web|title =100 Greatest Film Musicals|url = http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_musicals.php|accessdate = 7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best Movie Musicals of All Time |url=http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221130312/http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |archivedate=21 February 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top 100 Greatest Movie Musicals of All Time|url = http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time/|accessdate = 7 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206232128/http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time|archive-date = 6 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nHis later films fared less successfully, although ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1972 film)|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', in which he played the White Rabbit, enjoyed moderate success in the UK. After performing in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and with offers of work greatly reduced and much of his salary from ''Hello, Dolly!'' lost, reportedly due to underhanded investments by his agent,<ref name=\"parcel\">{{cite book|url=http://www.mcifa.com/parcel3.cfm|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Parcel Arrived Safely, Tied with String|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> Crawford faced a brief period of unemployment, in which he helped his wife stuff cushions (for their upholstery business) and took a job as an office clerk in an electric company to pass the time between. During this difficult time, his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1975.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em''===\nCrawford's acting career took off again after he appeared on the London stage in the farce ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'', in which he played the part of frantic chief cashier Brian Runnicles. His performance led to an invitation to star in a [[BBC]] television comedy series about a childlike and eternally haphazard man who causes disaster everywhere he goes. Crawford was not the first choice for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''. Originally, the part had been offered to comedy actor [[Ronnie Barker]] but after he and [[Norman Wisdom]] had turned it down, Crawford took on the challenge, adopting a similar characterisation to that which he used when playing Brian Runnicles. Cast alongside him was actress [[Michele Dotrice]] in the role of Frank's long-suffering wife, Betty, and the series premiered in 1973.\n\n''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'' soon became one of the [[BBC]]'s most popular television series. Initially, only two series were produced, from 1973 to 1975, while the show's creators felt that it should stop while at its peak. There was a brief hiatus until popular demand saw it revived for a final series in 1978. The immense popularity that followed the sitcom was due perhaps to the unusual amount of physical comedy involved. Crawford said he had always been a fan of comedians such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], as well as the great sight gags employed in the days of silent film, and saw ''Some Mothers'' as the ideal opportunity to use such humour himself. He performed all of his own stunts during the show's run, and never used a double.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nWhile he was playing in ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford was approached to star in the musical ''[[Billy (musical)|Billy]]'' (based on the novel ''[[Billy Liar]]''), which opened in 1974 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. This was his first leading man role on the West End stage and helped to cement his career as both a singer and showman. The part was demanding, requiring proficiency in both song and dance, and in preparation for the role, Crawford began taking both more seriously, studying singing under the tutelage of vocal coach Ian Adam and spending hours perfecting his dancing capabilities with choreographer [[Onna White]].<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Billy'' gave the many fans of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer an opportunity to see him in a broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in ''[[Charlie and Algernon|Flowers for Algernon]]'' (1979) in the role of Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on a very short-lived ITV sitcom, ''[[Chalk and Cheese]]'', as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go over well with his fans: the popularity of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]], to the extent that they could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n\n====''Condorman''====\nCrawford starred in the 1981 Disney comedy/adventure film ''[[Condorman]]'', playing an eccentric American comic book writer and illustrator named Woody Wilkins who is asked by his friend at the [[CIA]] to help a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] woman to defect while acting out the fantasy of bringing his comic book creation, Condorman, to life.<ref>\n{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Condorman(1981)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082199|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Critics panned the film. On their television show, critics [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]] featured the film in their round-up of the year's worst films pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman in the air and the obvious bluescreen effect. The film performed poorly at the box office but years later gained a [[cult following]] among Disney fans.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n====''Barnum''====\nAlso in 1981, Crawford starred in the original London production of [[Cy Coleman]]'s ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' (1981) as the illustrious American showman [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]. He trained at the ''Big Apple Circus School'' in New York City to prepare for the ambitious stunts, learning to walk the tight-rope, juggle and slide down a rope from the rafters of the theatre. After further training for the second opening of ''Barnum'', he was awarded a British Amateur Gymnastics Association badge and certificate as a qualified coach.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Barnum'' opened on 11 June 1981 at the [[London Palladium]], where it ran for 655 performances. Crawford and [[Deborah Grant]] headed the cast. It was well-received, becoming a favourite of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as well as the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]]. Crawford earned his first [[Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical on the London stage. After the initial production of the show, he worked extensively with [[Torvill and Dean]], and can be seen rinkside with them as they received their \"perfect six\" marks in the 1983 world championships for their 'Barnum' routine.<ref>{{YouTube|o2UkD0tGitI|Crawford with Torvill & Dean receiving marks at World championships 1983}}</ref><ref>Hennessey, John. ''Torvill & Dean; David & Charles'' (1983); {{ISBN|0-7153-8476-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 a revival of ''Barnum'' opened in [[Manchester]] at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]], ending the tour at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]] in the West End. In 1986 this production, with a new cast, though still headed by Crawford, was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC. Crawford's ''Barnum'' is one of the longest runs by a leading actor.\n\n====''The Phantom of the Opera''====\nIn 1984, at the final preview of ''[[Starlight Express]]'', Crawford happened to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in ''Flowers for Algernon''. He informed Crawford that he was working on a new project based on a [[Gaston Leroux]] novel and wanted to know whether he was interested. Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided. Several months passed, during which Lloyd Webber had already created a pitch video featuring his then-wife [[Sarah Brightman]] as the female lead Christine, and British rocker [[Steve Harley]] as the Phantom, singing the title song in the manner of a contemporary [[New wave music|new wave]] video. Crawford was turned off by that, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a \"rock opera\"-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nSince casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber had also begun to regret his artistic choices. As production continued on the show, the bulk of the score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due in large part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear Crawford practising the aria ''Care Selve'', from the opera ''Atalanta'' by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber asked Ian Adam who his student was. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired virtually on the spot.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nMany critics were sceptical; Crawford was still largely pigeonholed as the hapless Frank Spencer, and questions were asked about Crawford's ability to manage such a vocally and dramatically demanding role. In 1986, he began his performance in London at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], continuing on to Broadway in 1988, and then Los Angeles in 1989. He played the role for two and a half years and over 1,300 performances, winning an [[Olivier Award]] (Best Actor in a Musical), a [[Tony Award]] (Best Performance by an Actor in a Lead Role, Musical), a New York [[Drama Desk Award]], and a [[Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award]] for Distinguished Achievement in Theatre (Lead Performance).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcifa.com/biography.cfm|title=biography, timeline|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the run of ''Phantom'' in Los Angeles, Crawford was asked to perform \"[[The Music of the Night]]\" at the Inaugural Gala for President [[George H. W. Bush]] in Washington, D.C., on 19 January 1989. At the gala, Crawford was presented with a birthday cake (it was his 47th birthday). On 29 April 1990, after three and a half years and over 1,300 performances later, Crawford left the show. He admits to having been saddened at his departure, and, during the final Lair scene, altered the Phantom's line to \"Christine....I ''loved'' you...\", acknowledging that this was his final performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-30/local/me-82_1_michael-crawford|title='Phantom' Departs Amid Cheers, Tears|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 April 1990|last1=Braxton|first1=Greg}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nAt the request of Liz Kirschner, wife of film producer [[David Kirschner]], he obtained the role of Cornelius in [[20th Century Fox]]'s animated film ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', which was produced by her husband. During his voice over sessions, Michael stated that he had a terrible time singing one of the musical numbers called \"Please Wake Up\". This was because he had to struggle not to cry when this was being completed, as the scenario was that his character Cornelius was singing to a child who was on the verge of death. The film was released in cinemas over the summer of 1993. 1993 also saw the release of his special, ''A Touch of Music in the Night'', to coincide with the release of his new album of the same name. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, Crawford created the high-profile starring role in ''[[EFX (show)|EFX]]'', the US$70&nbsp;million production which officially opened the 1,700-seat [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The Atlantic Theater label released the companion album to EFX. Early into the run, Crawford suffered an accident during a performance (which involved him sliding from a wire hanger from the back of the theatre all the way to the stage and then jumping down {{convert|12|ft|m}} to the stage itself) and left the show to recover from his injury, which resulted in an early hip replacement operation.<ref>''Weekend Wogan'', 25 September 2011</ref>\n\n===2000s to present===\nCrawford had a short comeback to Broadway as the Count von Krolock in the short-lived musical ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)|Dance of the Vampires]]'' (2002\u201303). He originated the role of the morbidly obese Count Fosco in Lloyd Webber's ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]'', which opened at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], London in September 2004. However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance.
