The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the first and only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\n\nIn the final year of [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prepared for a very costly [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. This undertaking was preceded by a [[Air raids on Japan|conventional and firebombing campaign]] which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The [[European theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] had concluded when Germany signed its [[German Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]]. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the [[Imperial Japanese armed forces]] in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] on July 26, 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\n\nBy August 1945, the Allies' [[Manhattan Project]] had produced two types of atomic bombs, and the [[509th Composite Group]] of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized [[Silverplate]] version of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] that could deliver them from [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] bomb (\"[[Little Boy]]\") on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium [[implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]] bomb (\"[[Fat Man]]\") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute [[Effects_of_nuclear_explosions|effects of the atomic bombing]]s killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]], and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\n\nJapan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the Allies on August 15, six days after the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War|declaration of war]] and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] on September 2 in [[Tokyo Bay]], which effectively [[End of World War II in Asia|ended World War II]]. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in popular culture|popular culture]], and there is still [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|much debate]] concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.\n\n==Background==\n===Pacific War===\n{{Main|Pacific War}}\n[[File:1945-08-01JapWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Situation of the Pacific War on August 1, 1945.

Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25&nbsp;million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in [[World War II]] included both [[military personnel]] [[killed in action]] and [[wounded in action]]. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German [[Ardennes Offensive]]. America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2\u20133, 49\u201351}}\n\nIn the Pacific, the Allies [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u20131945)|returned to the Philippines]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=307}} [[Burma Campaign 1944\u20131945|recaptured Burma]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=532}} and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invaded Borneo]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=527}} Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], [[Aitape\u2013Wewak campaign|New Guinea]] and the Philippines.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=48\u201349}} In April 1945, American forces [[Battle of Okinawa|landed on Okinawa]], where heavy fighting continued until June.

Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] in April\u2013June 1945, 94% were killed;{{sfn|Brooks|Stanley|2007|pp=41\u201344}} 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedentedly large number.{{sfn|Appleman|Burns|Gugeler|Stevens|1948|pp=462\u2013467}}\n\nAs the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 [[Gross register tonnage|gross tons]] in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the middle of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]] advised [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.{{sfn|Coox|1969|pp=2540\u20132544}}\n\n===Preparations to invade Japan===\n{{Main|Operation Downfall}}\nEven before the [[Victory in Europe Day|surrender of Nazi Germany]] on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, [[Operation Downfall]], the Allied invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=32\u201334}} The operation had two parts: [[Operation Downfall#Olympic|Operation Olympic]] and [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]].

Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier.{{sfn|Reischauer|1986|p=101}}{{sfn|Kelly|2012|pp=183\u2013203}} }}\nOn May 30, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list due to its historical, religious and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=529}} Stimson then approached [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] about the matter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the target list.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=67\u201368}} Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July, but Stimson remained adamant.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}} On July 25, [[Nagasaki]] was put on the target list in place of Kyoto. It was a major military port, one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers, and an important producer of naval ordnance.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}}\n\n===Proposed demonstration===\nIn early May 1945, the [[Interim Committee]] was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to [[Nuclear technology|nuclear energy]].{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255\u2013256}} During the meetings on May 31 and June 1, scientist [[Ernest Lawrence]] had suggested giving the Japanese a non-combat demonstration.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=240}} [[Arthur Compton]] later recalled that:{{quote|It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=238\u2013239}} }}\nThe possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the [[Franck Report]] issued by physicist [[James Franck]] on June 11 and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that \"we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.\" Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255\u2013260}}\n\nLike Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied [[prisoners of war]] might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, although more bombs were in production, only two would be available at the start of August, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.{{sfn|Newman|1995|p=86}}<ref name=\"Generals\">{{cite web |title=The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date=August 13, 1945| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Leaflets===\n[[File:Firebombing leaflet.jpg|thumb|left|Various leaflets were dropped on Japan, three versions showing the names of 11 or 12 Japanese cities targeted for destruction by firebombing.

Sweeney tried repeatedly to contact the control tower for landing clearance, but received no answer. He could see heavy air traffic landing and taking off from [[Yontan Airfield]].

The heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. Its reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, ''Bockscar'' made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it.

Leahy]] had decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting \"an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/bombing-hiroshima-nagasaki-ethical-standard-common-the-barbarians-the-dark-ages-1444069 |newspaper=The Daily Star |title=Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\" \"An ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\" |date=August 6, 2017 |access-date=February 23, 2018 |first=Shahedul Anam |last=Khan }}</ref> but in October 1947, he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=267}}\n\nThe American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted only four years before the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb in September 1949.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=267}} The United States responded with the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], a nuclear weapon a thousand times as powerful as the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=291}} Such ordinary fission bombs would henceforth be regarded as small [[tactical nuclear weapons]]. By 1986, the United States had 23,317 nuclear weapons, while the [[Soviet Union]] had 40,159. By 2017, [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine nations had nuclear weapons]],{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=144}} but Japan was not one of them.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=269}} Japan reluctantly signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] in February 1970,{{sfn|Quester|1970|p=765}} but it is still sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella. American nuclear weapons were stored on Okinawa, and sometimes in Japan itself, albeit in contravention of agreements between the two nations.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|pp=80\u201382}} Lacking the resources to fight the Soviet Union using conventional forces, the [[Western Alliance]] came to depend on the use of nuclear weapons to defend itself during the [[Cold War]], a policy that became known in the 1950s as the [[New Look (policy)|New Look]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=272}} In the decades after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States would threaten to use its nuclear weapons many times.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|pp=319\u2013322}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Allen\n | first=Louis\n | editor-last = Hart\n | editor-first = Basil Liddell\n | editor-link =B.

The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the first and only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\n\nIn the final year of [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prepared for a very costly [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. This undertaking was preceded by a [[Air raids on Japan|conventional and firebombing campaign]] which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The [[European theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] had concluded when Germany signed its [[German Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]]. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the [[Imperial Japanese armed forces]] in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] on July 26, 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\n\nBy August 1945, the Allies' [[Manhattan Project]] had produced two types of atomic bombs, and the [[509th Composite Group]] of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized [[Silverplate]] version of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] that could deliver them from [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] bomb (\"[[Little Boy]]\") on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium [[implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]] bomb (\"[[Fat Man]]\") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute [[Effects_of_nuclear_explosions|effects of the atomic bombing]]s killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]], and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\n\nJapan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the Allies on August 15, six days after the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War|declaration of war]] and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] on September 2 in [[Tokyo Bay]], which effectively [[End of World War II in Asia|ended World War II]]. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in popular culture|popular culture]], and there is still [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|much debate]] concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.\n\n==Background==\n===Pacific War===\n{{Main|Pacific War}}\n[[File:1945-08-01JapWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Situation of the Pacific War on August 1, 1945.

Allied-held areas are in red, with the neutral Soviet Union and Mongolia in grey.|alt=A map of East Asia and the Western Pacific during World War II]]\nIn 1945, the [[Pacific War]] between the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] entered its fourth year. Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25&nbsp;million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in [[World War II]] included both [[military personnel]] [[killed in action]] and [[wounded in action]]. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German [[Ardennes Offensive]]. America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2\u20133, 49\u201351}}\n\nIn the Pacific, the Allies [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u20131945)|returned to the Philippines]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=307}} [[Burma Campaign 1944\u20131945|recaptured Burma]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=532}} and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invaded Borneo]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=527}} Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], [[Aitape\u2013Wewak campaign|New Guinea]] and the Philippines.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=48\u201349}} In April 1945, American forces [[Battle of Okinawa|landed on Okinawa]], where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2\u20133, 49\u201351}} Although some Japanese soldiers were [[Japanese prisoners of war in World War II|taken prisoner]], most fought until they were killed or committed [[suicide]]. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] in April\u2013June 1945, 94% were killed;{{sfn|Brooks|Stanley|2007|pp=41\u201344}} 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedentedly large number.{{sfn|Appleman|Burns|Gugeler|Stevens|1948|pp=462\u2013467}}\n\nAs the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 [[Gross register tonnage|gross tons]] in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the middle of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]] advised [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.{{sfn|Coox|1969|pp=2540\u20132544}}\n\n===Preparations to invade Japan===\n{{Main|Operation Downfall}}\nEven before the [[Victory in Europe Day|surrender of Nazi Germany]] on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, [[Operation Downfall]], the Allied invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=32\u201334}} The operation had two parts: [[Operation Downfall#Olympic|Operation Olympic]] and [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]]. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, [[Kyushu|Ky\u016bsh\u016b]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=125\u2013130}} Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the [[Kant\u014d Plain]], near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of [[Honshu|Honsh\u016b]] by the U.S. [[First United States Army|First]], [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth]] and [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth]] Armies, as well as a [[Commonwealth Corps]] made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the [[Climate of Japan|Japanese winter]] to pass.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\n[[File:\"Jap...You're Next^ We'll Finish the Job\" - NARA - 513563.jpg|thumb|left|upright|U.S. Army propaganda poster depicting [[Uncle Sam]] preparing the public for the invasion of Japan after ending war on Germany and Italy|alt=Uncle Sam holding a spanner, rolling up his sleeves]]\n[[Geography of Japan|Japan's geography]] made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, [[Operation Ketsug\u014d]], accordingly.

Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi]], predicted up to 20&nbsp;million Japanese deaths.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=121\u2013124}}\n\nOn June 15, 1945, a study by the Joint War Plans Committee,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Final Months of the War With Japan.

Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George Marshall]], and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]], signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=48}}\n\nThe Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through [[Ultra]] intelligence.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=202\u2013225}} [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L.

Tolman]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=528\u2013529}}\n\nThe Target Committee nominated five targets: [[Kokura]] (now [[Kitakyushu]]), the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; [[Hiroshima]], an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; [[Yokohama]], an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and [[Kyoto]], a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:\n* The target was larger than {{convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and was an important target in a large city.\n* The blast would create effective damage.\n* The target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.<ref name=\"targetcommittee\" />\n\nThese cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids, and the Army Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the damage caused by the atomic bombs could be made. Hiroshima was described as \"an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.

If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=238\u2013239}} }}\nThe possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the [[Franck Report]] issued by physicist [[James Franck]] on June 11 and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that \"we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.\" Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255\u2013260}}\n\nLike Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied [[prisoners of war]] might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, although more bombs were in production, only two would be available at the start of August, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.{{sfn|Newman|1995|p=86}}<ref name=\"Generals\">{{cite web |title=The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date=August 13, 1945| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Leaflets===\n[[File:Firebombing leaflet.jpg|thumb|left|Various leaflets were dropped on Japan, three versions showing the names of 11 or 12 Japanese cities targeted for destruction by firebombing.

The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.<ref name=\"SM16\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07m1.htm| title=Timeline #3- the 509th; The Nagasaki Mission| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring pre-flight inspection of ''Bockscar'', the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use {{convert|640|USgal}} of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live.

When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, ''Big Stink'' failed to make the rendezvous.<ref name=\"SM16\" /> According to Cheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including {{convert|9000|ft}} higher than he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over [[Yakushima]] as previously agreed with Sweeney and Captain [[Frederick C.

Before leaving the rendezvous point, Sweeney consulted Ashworth, who was in charge of the bomb. As commander of the aircraft, Sweeney made the decision to proceed to the primary, the city of Kokura.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|p=211}}\n\n[[File:Nagasaki 1945 - Before and after (adjusted).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Nagasaki before and after the bombing and the fires had long since burnt out|alt=The before image looks like a city.

Sweeney tried repeatedly to contact the control tower for landing clearance, but received no answer. He could see heavy air traffic landing and taking off from [[Yontan Airfield]]. Firing off every flare on board to alert the field to his emergency landing, the ''Bockscar'' came in fast, landing at {{convert|140|mph}} instead of the normal {{convert|120|mph}}. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as he began the final approach. Touching down on only three engines midway down the landing strip, ''Bockscar'' bounced up into the air again for about {{convert|25|feet}} before slamming back down hard. The heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. Its reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, ''Bockscar'' made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion before the plane came to a stop.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=222\u2013226}}\n\nFollowing the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the plane.
