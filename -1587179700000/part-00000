Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spinoffs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series' ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Dino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother.

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spinoffs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series' ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Dino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother.

Built in 1915, it was the first highway crossing of the lower Colorado and is the earliest example of a through truss bridge in Arizona. It is also the only example of a Pennsylvania truss within Arizona.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /> Originally the bridge carried the transcontinental Ocean-to-Ocean Highway and later carried its successor, [[U.S. Route 80 in Arizona|US 80]] until a new bridge was built to the west in 1956.<ref name=\"Jensen\">{{cite book | title=Drive the Broadway of America! | publisher=Bygone Byways | author=Jensen, Jeff | year=2013 | location=Tucson, Arizona | pages= 94, 204 | isbn=978-0978625900}}</ref> Between 1988 and 2001, the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic and only traversable by pedestrians and bicyclists. After a major restoration, the bridge was rehabilitated and reopened to vehicular traffic in 2002, with a re-dedication by the [[Quechan]] nation and [[Yuma Crossing|Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area]].<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> The bridge became part of Historic US 80 in 2018.\n\n==History==\nIn 1913, following massive pressure against Arizona Congressman Carl Hayden by the citizens of [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], Hayden lobbied Congress, proposing federal aid be used for construction of a permanent highway crossing spanning the lower [[Colorado River]].<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /><ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Congress authorized the construction of the bridge under the pretense that it was to be used in connecting Yuma to the [[Fort Yuma Indian Reservation]] located on the opposing bank of the river. It was therefore, the federal funding would be provided through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Office of Indian Affairs]] (OIA). Further capital was raised and provided by the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]] and [[Imperial County, California]]; each providing $25,000. OIA engineers in [[Washington D.C.]] were tasked with designing the new bridge. The new bridge design was to be a steel, Pennsylvania through truss design complemented by a Warren deck truss second span, both resting upon concrete piers and abutments above the river. The location of the bridge was to be upstream from an existing ferry crossing at Prison Hill Road.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" />\n\nThe [[Omaha Structural Steel Works]] was awarded the construction contract by the OIA in June 1914, at a cost of $73,800. Construction on the bridge began in September 1914.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Between October and February, problems arose constructing the bridge, as both Omaha Steel and the OIA were unfamiliar with the currents and flood patterns of the lower Colorado. [[Falsework]] erected to aid in the bridge's construction were twice washed downstream by floods.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /><ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Omaha Steel decided to approach construction of the twin span bridge by a different method; constructing the spans on barges and floating each span down river into position. The {{convert|336|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} span was floated down river and swung into place carefully and methodically on March 3, 1915, followed by local praise and celebration. Following completion, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was ceremoniously opened to the public on May 22, 1915. The bridge became a crucial link in the nationwide transcontinental Ocean-to-Ocean Highway and was also the first highway bridge across the lower Colorado River.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" />\n\nOn November 11, 1926, the bridge became part of [[U.S. Route 80 in Arizona|U.S. Route 80]].<ref name=\"Jensen\" /><ref name=\"FHWA\">{{cite web | url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us80.cfm | title=U.S. Route 80 The Dixie Overland Highway | publisher=Federal Highway Administration | work=Webpage | date=18 November 2015 | accessdate=1 September 2016 | author=Weingroff, Richard}}</ref> The successor to the earlier Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, US 80 became the primary east to west transcontinental highway in Arizona and between the 1920s and 1930s, carried the majority of the state's auto traffic.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /> During the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was used by California state police officers to deny entry refugees of the dust bowl hailing from Oklahoma intending to find work in California. Often called \"Okies\", these people found work instead around Yuma, County between Yuma and [[Wellton, Arizona|Wellton]]. The refugees soon provided critically needed assistance to local farmers.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> In 1956, US 80 was re-routed off the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge and onto a newer bridge built downstream at the foot of Fourth Avenue.<ref name=\"Jensen\" /> Following construction of the Fourth Avenue Bridge and the construction of Interstate 8 in the early 1970s, vehicular traffic and importance of the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge steadily declined.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Similarly, the historic transcontinental highway which the bridge had once carried, US 80, declined and was removed from [[San Diego]] to [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]] between 1964 and 1977, no longer running through Yuma.<ref name=\"FHWA\" /> In 1978, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Despite the newly gained honor, vehicular traffic was no longer allowed to use the bridge after 1988. In 2001, a $3 million restoration and rehabilitation project was begun, temporarily closing the bridge to pedestrians as well. Following the extensive restoration and a re-dedication ceremony, the bridge was re-opened to traffic in 2002 and now carries Penitentiary Avenue.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was designated as part of Historic U.S. Route 80 by the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] on September 21, 2018.<ref name=\"THPF\">{{cite web |

Further capital was raised and provided by the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]] and [[Imperial County, California]]; each providing $25,000. OIA engineers in [[Washington D.C.]] were tasked with designing the new bridge. The new bridge design was to be a steel, Pennsylvania through truss design complemented by a Warren deck truss second span, both resting upon concrete piers and abutments above the river. The location of the bridge was to be upstream from an existing ferry crossing at Prison Hill Road.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" />\n\nThe [[Omaha Structural Steel Works]] was awarded the construction contract by the OIA in June 1914, at a cost of $73,800. Construction on the bridge began in September 1914.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Between October and February, problems arose constructing the bridge, as both Omaha Steel and the OIA were unfamiliar with the currents and flood patterns of the lower Colorado. [[Falsework]] erected to aid in the bridge's construction were twice washed downstream by floods.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /><ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Omaha Steel decided to approach construction of the twin span bridge by a different method; constructing the spans on barges and floating each span down river into position. The {{convert|336|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} span was floated down river and swung into place carefully and methodically on March 3, 1915, followed by local praise and celebration. Following completion, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was ceremoniously opened to the public on May 22, 1915. The bridge became a crucial link in the nationwide transcontinental Ocean-to-Ocean Highway and was also the first highway bridge across the lower Colorado River.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" />\n\nOn November 11, 1926, the bridge became part of [[U.S. Route 80 in Arizona|U.S. Route 80]].<ref name=\"Jensen\" /><ref name=\"FHWA\">{{cite web | url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us80.cfm | title=U.S. Route 80 The Dixie Overland Highway | publisher=Federal Highway Administration | work=Webpage | date=18 November 2015 | accessdate=1 September 2016 | author=Weingroff, Richard}}</ref> The successor to the earlier Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, US 80 became the primary east to west transcontinental highway in Arizona and between the 1920s and 1930s, carried the majority of the state's auto traffic.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /> During the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was used by California state police officers to deny entry refugees of the dust bowl hailing from Oklahoma intending to find work in California. Often called \"Okies\", these people found work instead around Yuma, County between Yuma and [[Wellton, Arizona|Wellton]]. The refugees soon provided critically needed assistance to local farmers.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> In 1956, US 80 was re-routed off the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge and onto a newer bridge built downstream at the foot of Fourth Avenue.<ref name=\"Jensen\" /> Following construction of the Fourth Avenue Bridge and the construction of Interstate 8 in the early 1970s, vehicular traffic and importance of the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge steadily declined.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Similarly, the historic transcontinental highway which the bridge had once carried, US 80, declined and was removed from [[San Diego]] to [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]] between 1964 and 1977, no longer running through Yuma.<ref name=\"FHWA\" /> In 1978, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Despite the newly gained honor, vehicular traffic was no longer allowed to use the bridge after 1988. In 2001, a $3 million restoration and rehabilitation project was begun, temporarily closing the bridge to pedestrians as well. Following the extensive restoration and a re-dedication ceremony, the bridge was re-opened to traffic in 2002 and now carries Penitentiary Avenue.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was designated as part of Historic U.S. Route 80 by the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] on September 21, 2018.<ref name=\"THPF\">{{cite web | url=https://preservetucson.org/stories/historic-arizona-u-s-route-80-designation/ | title=Historic Arizona U.S. Route 80 Designation | publisher=Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation | work=Webpage | date=August 2017 | accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|Arizona|National Register of Historic Places}}\n* [[List of historic properties in Yuma, Arizona]] \n* [[List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Yuma County, Arizona]]\n* [[Yuma Crossing]]\n* [[Gillespie Dam Bridge]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ocean to Ocean Bridge (Yuma, Arizona)}}\n* [http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMCF27_Ocean_To_Ocean_Bridge_Yuma_AZ Ocean To Ocean Bridge \u2013 Yuma, AZ \u2013 U.S. National Register of Historic Places] \u2013 Waymarking.com\n* [http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/az/old_80/ Old US 80, Yuma: Ocean to Ocean Bridge] \u2013 Alpsroads.net \u2013 In depth photographs of the bridge modern day.\n* [http://www.visityuma.com/destination/ocean-to-ocean-bridge Ocean to Ocean Bridge \u2013 Visit Yuma]\n* [http://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/79000431.pdf Ocean to Ocean Highway Bridge NRHP Nomination Form]\n* [http://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/local/history/2014/06/20/london-bridge-historical-arizona-bridges/11107783/ London Bridge and other historical Arizona bridges] \u2013 AZCentral.com\n\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n{{Crossings navbox\n|structure= Crossings\n|place= [[Colorado River]]\n|bridge= Ocean to Ocean Bridge\n|bridge signs={{jct|country=USA|state=AZ|US-Hist|80}}\n|upstream= [[Laguna Dam]]\n|upstream signs= <!--No Highway-->\n|downstream= I-8 Colorado River Bridge\n|downstream signs={{jct|country=USA|I|8}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Road bridges in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1915]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Yuma County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:1915 establishments in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Yuma County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Yuma, Arizona]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Yuma County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 80]]\n[[Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Bridges over the Colorado River]]\n[[Category:Steel bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Warren truss bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania truss bridges in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_to_Ocean_Bridge"}

The monument is high on the Shonto plateau, overlooking the Tsegi Canyon system, west of [[Kayenta, Arizona]]. It features a visitor center with a museum, two short self-guided mesa top trails, two small campgrounds, and a picnic area. Rangers guide visitors on free tours of the '''Keet Seel''' and '''Betatakin''' cliff dwellings. The '''Inscription House''' site, further west, is currently closed to public access.\n\nThe Sandal Trail is an accessible self-guided walk that provides views of the spectacular canyonlands and rugged topography near the visitor center. Interpretive signs provide information on local flora and other topics. The {{Convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} round-trip trail ends at an overlook of the Betatakin ruins across the 560-foot-deep (170 m) Betatakin Canyon. The National Monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n\n== Keet Seel ==\n'''Keet Seel''' or '''Kiet Siel''' ({{spell-nv|K\u012fts\u02bciil}}), which stands for \"broken pottery scattered around\"<ref>https://www.nps.gov/nava/planyourvisit/upload/nava_s1-for-web-use.pdf</ref> in Navajo, is a well preserved cliff dwelling of the ancient [[Anasazi]] (ancestral puebloans) people located in a branch of the [[Tsegi Canyon]] in the Kayenta region. The site was first occupied at around 1250, during a time in which a large number of people were believed to be aggregating in sites such as this in this part of the American Southwest. There was a construction boom at Keet Seel between 1272 and 1275, with construction then slowly tapering off and halting completely at 1286. Once construction halted in 1286, there was no evidence of structures being built until its subsequent abandonment some 20 years later. It is believed that, at its peak, up to 150 people inhabited this site at one time. Due to the extremely dry climate and natural overhanging cliff the site's dwellings and artifacts are well preserved. Keet Seel is considered by many archaeological experts to be one of the best preserved larger ruins in the American Southwest.<ref name=oldones>Roberts, David. 1996. In Search of the Old Ones: Exploring the Anasazi World of the Southwest. Touchstone Press. pp. 271</ref>\n\n== Betatakin ==\n'''Betatakin''' means \"House Built on a Ledge\" in Navajo. In Hopi, the name of the place is ''Talastima'', or \"Place of the Corn Tassel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/inventory/publications/reports/nava_gre_rpt_body_print.pdf |title=Navajo National Monument: Geologic Resource Evaluation Report |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> Betatakin is smaller than nearby Keet Seel, with about 120 rooms at the time of abandonment. However, like Keet Seel, Betatakin was constructed of sandstone, mud mortar, and wood. Today only about 80 rooms remain, due to rock falls inside the alcove. Betatakin only has one kiva,<ref name=oldones/> whereas Kiet Siel has several. Betatakin was built in an enormous alcove measuring 452 feet high and 370 feet across between 1267 and 1286<ref name=dean69>Dean, Jeffrey. 1969. Chronological analysis of Tsegi Phase sites in Northeastern Arizona. Tucson.</ref> The first excavations occurred in 1909 under Byron Cummings, University of Utah,<ref>records at the Natural History Museum of Utah</ref> and continued into the 1950s and 1960s under archaeologists like Jeffery Dean.<ref name=oldones/> During its two-decade heyday Dean estimated a maximum population of about 125 people.\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe site of Keet Seel was known to resident Navajos in the area for decades or longer prior to the first Anglos arriving in 1895 (the Wetherill brothers). Originally part of a ranching family from Colorado, the Wetherills' keen interest in the ancient Anasazi (ancestral puebloans) led them to pursue numerous expeditions into the heart of the Kayenta region, largely uncovering a number of sites that had remained undiscovered to Anglos until then. The Wetherills took many artifacts from the ruins which the Navajos had left untouched for centuries. [[Richard Wetherill]] is credited for selecting the term Anasazi, which refers to the ancient people (ancestral puebloans) that inhabited this region and means \"Revered Ancestors\" in Navajo. It was not until 1909, after Navajo National Monument was created, that John Wetherill, Byron Cummings, and Navajo guide Clatsozen Benully first recorded Betatakin.<ref>Judd, Neil M. \u201cByron Cummings 1860-1954.\u201d American Antiquity, vol. 20, no. 2, 1954, pp. 154\u2013157.</ref>\nThe Wetherill Brothers made a living from giving guided tours of sites in and around the Tsegi Canyon and Utah. Later in their careers, the Wetherill brothers were largely involved in efforts for the preservation and protection of the sites that made up Navajo National Monument. The artifacts which the Wetherills had removed from the Anasazi sites were sold or shipped to far-flung locations so that today little is known of the artifacts' whereabouts.\n\n== Subsistence ==\nThe Anasazi (ancestral puebloans) of this area were a sedentary group that largely based their subsistence on agriculture. Their primary crop at the sites within Navajo National Monument was [[maize]], with beans and [[cucurbits]] also being incorporated into their diet. While the people of the Tsegi Canyon system relied heavily on agriculture for their food, they also hunted wild game that was indigenous to the area.\n\nIt is thought that these Anasazi people lived in these cave dwellings to optimize the amount of sustainable land to produce crops. By living in these caves, and not on the mesas or the canyon floors, they were able to use this land towards agricultural production to ensure their success in this high elevation, desert environment. The ruins that make up Navajo National Monument were a large number of rooms used for storage, suggesting that at some point their crop production was successful enough to dedicate a significant amount of their living area towards storage purposes.\n\n== Dwellings/Architecture ==\n[[File:Betatakin Cliff Dwellings.jpg|thumb|Betatakin ruins in Betatakin Canyon.]]\nThe structures contained within this cave site were constructed mainly of sandstone blocks plastered together with mud and mortar. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwelling of Navajo National Monument reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the mid to late 13th century.\n\nWhile much of the construction in this site remains similar to common ancestral Pueblo architectural forms, including such features as [[Kivas]], a circular tower (at Keet Seel), and pit-houses, the limited space that this site presented created a much more densely populated living area. At its peak, Keet Seel had more than 150 rooms and 6 kivas, while Betatakin had about 120 rooms and only one kiva.<ref name=oldones/>\n\n[[Jacal]] walls were also found to be used at this site. Jacal walls were made from a screen of upright wooden poles plastered together with mud. The dry conditions and protection from the elements at Keet Seel allowed for preservation of these architectural characteristics.\n\nThere were also a number of structures believed to be built at the base of the cliff as well. But due to this area not being protected by the over-hanging cliff wall, its exposure to the elements led to its destruction by erosion. At Keet Seel, archaeological excavations have revealed that there were 25 room clusters beneath the overhanging wall, each that included one common living room, with anywhere from one to four storage rooms surrounding a small courtyard. The layout of these dwellings greatly mirrored that of the [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] structures at [[Mesa Verde]], whereas Betatakin had about 20 room clusters.\n\n== Abandonment ==\nAlthough many archaeologists agree that there is a definitive and sharp exodus from this region in the Southwest, there has been considerable debate on the determining factors that forced people to migrate out of this area. Archaeologists have determined that there was a distinct decrease in the amount of annual precipitation between AD 1276 and 1299, a period of time that is now referred to as the \"Great Drought\". With the limited amount of rainfall in an already arid environment, there is no doubt that there was a considerable amount of increased stress put on the agricultural systems that these people depended on.\n\nThere is evidence later in the record to suggest the beginning of an episode of deep arroyo cutting, that would have damaged what was left of the usable agricultural land. Increased deposition of sediment onto agricultural lands caused the lowering of the water table, thus making the land inadequate for farming. Regardless of their reasoning, near the end of the thirteenth century it's evident that the Anasazi(ancestral puebloans) people migrated towards places with more stable and abundant water sources, suggesting that the agricultural land in this area had become unsuitable to sustain the population levels that once inhabited this spectacular cave site.\n\n[[Hopi]] legends tell a different tale. According to oral tradition, the area known as Wunuqa (modern day Tsegi Canyon)<ref name=oldones/> was abandoned as part of a spiritual quest.<ref name=oldones/><ref name=4thworld>Courlander, Harold. 1971.

The monument is high on the Shonto plateau, overlooking the Tsegi Canyon system, west of [[Kayenta, Arizona]]. It features a visitor center with a museum, two short self-guided mesa top trails, two small campgrounds, and a picnic area. Rangers guide visitors on free tours of the '''Keet Seel''' and '''Betatakin''' cliff dwellings. The '''Inscription House''' site, further west, is currently closed to public access.\n\nThe Sandal Trail is an accessible self-guided walk that provides views of the spectacular canyonlands and rugged topography near the visitor center. Interpretive signs provide information on local flora and other topics. The {{Convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} round-trip trail ends at an overlook of the Betatakin ruins across the 560-foot-deep (170 m) Betatakin Canyon. The National Monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n\n== Keet Seel ==\n'''Keet Seel''' or '''Kiet Siel''' ({{spell-nv|K\u012fts\u02bciil}}), which stands for \"broken pottery scattered around\"<ref>https://www.nps.gov/nava/planyourvisit/upload/nava_s1-for-web-use.pdf</ref> in Navajo, is a well preserved cliff dwelling of the ancient [[Anasazi]] (ancestral puebloans) people located in a branch of the [[Tsegi Canyon]] in the Kayenta region. The site was first occupied at around 1250, during a time in which a large number of people were believed to be aggregating in sites such as this in this part of the American Southwest. There was a construction boom at Keet Seel between 1272 and 1275, with construction then slowly tapering off and halting completely at 1286. Once construction halted in 1286, there was no evidence of structures being built until its subsequent abandonment some 20 years later. It is believed that, at its peak, up to 150 people inhabited this site at one time. Due to the extremely dry climate and natural overhanging cliff the site's dwellings and artifacts are well preserved. Keet Seel is considered by many archaeological experts to be one of the best preserved larger ruins in the American Southwest.<ref name=oldones>Roberts, David. 1996. In Search of the Old Ones: Exploring the Anasazi World of the Southwest. Touchstone Press. pp. 271</ref>\n\n== Betatakin ==\n'''Betatakin''' means \"House Built on a Ledge\" in Navajo. In Hopi, the name of the place is ''Talastima'', or \"Place of the Corn Tassel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/inventory/publications/reports/nava_gre_rpt_body_print.pdf |title=Navajo National Monument: Geologic Resource Evaluation Report |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> Betatakin is smaller than nearby Keet Seel, with about 120 rooms at the time of abandonment. However, like Keet Seel, Betatakin was constructed of sandstone, mud mortar, and wood. Today only about 80 rooms remain, due to rock falls inside the alcove. Betatakin only has one kiva,<ref name=oldones/> whereas Kiet Siel has several. Betatakin was built in an enormous alcove measuring 452 feet high and 370 feet across between 1267 and 1286<ref name=dean69>Dean, Jeffrey. 1969. Chronological analysis of Tsegi Phase sites in Northeastern Arizona. Tucson.</ref> The first excavations occurred in 1909 under Byron Cummings, University of Utah,<ref>records at the Natural History Museum of Utah</ref> and continued into the 1950s and 1960s under archaeologists like Jeffery Dean.<ref name=oldones/> During its two-decade heyday Dean estimated a maximum population of about 125 people.\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe site of Keet Seel was known to resident Navajos in the area for decades or longer prior to the first Anglos arriving in 1895 (the Wetherill brothers). Originally part of a ranching family from Colorado, the Wetherills' keen interest in the ancient Anasazi (ancestral puebloans) led them to pursue numerous expeditions into the heart of the Kayenta region, largely uncovering a number of sites that had remained undiscovered to Anglos until then. The Wetherills took many artifacts from the ruins which the Navajos had left untouched for centuries. [[Richard Wetherill]] is credited for selecting the term Anasazi, which refers to the ancient people (ancestral puebloans) that inhabited this region and means \"Revered Ancestors\" in Navajo. It was not until 1909, after Navajo National Monument was created, that John Wetherill, Byron Cummings, and Navajo guide Clatsozen Benully first recorded Betatakin.<ref>Judd, Neil M. \u201cByron Cummings 1860-1954.\u201d American Antiquity, vol. 20, no. 2, 1954, pp. 154\u2013157.</ref>\nThe Wetherill Brothers made a living from giving guided tours of sites in and around the Tsegi Canyon and Utah. Later in their careers, the Wetherill brothers were largely involved in efforts for the preservation and protection of the sites that made up Navajo National Monument. The artifacts which the Wetherills had removed from the Anasazi sites were sold or shipped to far-flung locations so that today little is known of the artifacts' whereabouts.\n\n== Subsistence ==\nThe Anasazi (ancestral puebloans) of this area were a sedentary group that largely based their subsistence on agriculture. Their primary crop at the sites within Navajo National Monument was [[maize]], with beans and [[cucurbits]] also being incorporated into their diet. While the people of the Tsegi Canyon system relied heavily on agriculture for their food, they also hunted wild game that was indigenous to the area.\n\nIt is thought that these Anasazi people lived in these cave dwellings to optimize the amount of sustainable land to produce crops. By living in these caves, and not on the mesas or the canyon floors, they were able to use this land towards agricultural production to ensure their success in this high elevation, desert environment. The ruins that make up Navajo National Monument were a large number of rooms used for storage, suggesting that at some point their crop production was successful enough to dedicate a significant amount of their living area towards storage purposes.\n\n== Dwellings/Architecture ==\n[[File:Betatakin Cliff Dwellings.jpg|thumb|Betatakin ruins in Betatakin Canyon.]]\nThe structures contained within this cave site were constructed mainly of sandstone blocks plastered together with mud and mortar. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwelling of Navajo National Monument reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the mid to late 13th century.\n\nWhile much of the construction in this site remains similar to common ancestral Pueblo architectural forms, including such features as [[Kivas]], a circular tower (at Keet Seel), and pit-houses, the limited space that this site presented created a much more densely populated living area. At its peak, Keet Seel had more than 150 rooms and 6 kivas, while Betatakin had about 120 rooms and only one kiva.<ref name=oldones/>\n\n[[Jacal]] walls were also found to be used at this site. Jacal walls were made from a screen of upright wooden poles plastered together with mud. The dry conditions and protection from the elements at Keet Seel allowed for preservation of these architectural characteristics.\n\nThere were also a number of structures believed to be built at the base of the cliff as well. But due to this area not being protected by the over-hanging cliff wall, its exposure to the elements led to its destruction by erosion. At Keet Seel, archaeological excavations have revealed that there were 25 room clusters beneath the overhanging wall, each that included one common living room, with anywhere from one to four storage rooms surrounding a small courtyard. The layout of these dwellings greatly mirrored that of the [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] structures at [[Mesa Verde]], whereas Betatakin had about 20 room clusters.\n\n== Abandonment ==\nAlthough many archaeologists agree that there is a definitive and sharp exodus from this region in the Southwest, there has been considerable debate on the determining factors that forced people to migrate out of this area. Archaeologists have determined that there was a distinct decrease in the amount of annual precipitation between AD 1276 and 1299, a period of time that is now referred to as the \"Great Drought\". With the limited amount of rainfall in an already arid environment, there is no doubt that there was a considerable amount of increased stress put on the agricultural systems that these people depended on.\n\nThere is evidence later in the record to suggest the beginning of an episode of deep arroyo cutting, that would have damaged what was left of the usable agricultural land. Increased deposition of sediment onto agricultural lands caused the lowering of the water table, thus making the land inadequate for farming. Regardless of their reasoning, near the end of the thirteenth century it's evident that the Anasazi(ancestral puebloans) people migrated towards places with more stable and abundant water sources, suggesting that the agricultural land in this area had become unsuitable to sustain the population levels that once inhabited this spectacular cave site.\n\n[[Hopi]] legends tell a different tale. According to oral tradition, the area known as Wunuqa (modern day Tsegi Canyon)<ref name=oldones/> was abandoned as part of a spiritual quest.<ref name=oldones/><ref name=4thworld>Courlander, Harold. 1971. The Fourth World of the Hopis: the epic story of the Hopi Indians as preserved in their legends and traditions.pp. 239.

The Horn Clan forced the Snake Clan out, due to the children of the Snake Clan biting other children and causing death.<ref name=4thworld/> This may be an allegory for some historical occurrence, in which one group forced another out for a perceived fault or slight.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument]]\n* [[Mesa Verde National Park]]\n* [[Oasisamerica|Oasisamerica cultures]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Related Readings==\n#Doyel, David E. & Dean, Jeffrey S. \"Environmental Change and Human Adaptation in the Ancient American Southwest\".
