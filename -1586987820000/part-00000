W. Hagerty library in [[West Philadelphia]]. That same year Drexel received approval from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] to start the school.<ref name=\"BW\" /> The decision to launch a law school with cooperative education in a city with five other law schools was based on a demand for graduates with immediate experience, with the president of Drexel University, [[Constantine Papadakis]], saying that employers \"like to hire a graduate and have them immediately be useful.\"<ref name=\"CoOp\" /> The School of Law joins [[Temple University Beasley School of Law|Temple University]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|University of Pennsylvania]], [[Villanova University School of Law|Villanova University]], [[Rutgers School of Law\u2013Camden|Rutgers University]], and [[Widener University School of Law|Widener University]] to become the sixth law school in the [[Delaware Valley]].
