Meanwhile, Heckyl makes a deal with a heartbroken Poisandra, promising to share a secret with her in exchange for her help. Zenowing uses his powers to heal Riley before going to confront Dooming, only to be captured and nearly remerged with his evil side by the Dark Energem; however, a recovered Riley arrives and saves him just as the other Rangers arrive to help. Arcanon leaves Doomwing to be destroyed while Singe and Fury search for the misplaced Dark Energem, and after an intense battle the Rangers destroy the revived monsters and Zenowing is able to reclaim the Silver Energem and destroy Doomwing by morphing. Back aboard Sledge's ship, Poisandra gives Heckyl an explosive that allows him to break out of his cell, but upon seeing Singe returning the Dark Energem to Arcanon he remembers his true past as an inhabitant of Sentai 6 who attempted to keep the Dark Energem away from Arcanon only to have Snide created as his evil half in the process. Heckyl is then reimprisoned, swearing revenge on Arcanon as he does so, while Zenowing bonds with his fellow Rangers.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|List of Power Rangers Dino Super Charge episodes\n|EpisodeNumber=825\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n | LineColor=0f9\n | Title=Freaky Fightday\n | DirectedBy=Ric Pellizzeri\n | WrittenBy=Alwyn Dale, Becca Barnes, and Chip Lynn\n | OriginalAirDate= {{ Start date |2016|10|22}}\n | Viewers=1.34<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-10-22-2016.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 10.22.2016|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|accessdate=October 25, 2016|work=ShowBuzzDaily|date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n  | ShortSummary=Game face and Nightmare are revived and another monster comes and switches the rangers bodies around, Tyler is Shelby, Koda is Chase, Shelby is Tyler, Chase is Koda, Riley is Ivan, & Ivan is Riley.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|List of Power Rangers Dino Super Charge episodes\n|EpisodeNumber=826\n |EpisodeNumber2=17\n | LineColor=0f9\n | Title=Worgworld\n | DirectedBy=Michael Duignan\n | WrittenBy=Becca Barnes, Alwyn Dale, and Chip Lynn\n | OriginalAirDate= {{ Start date |2016|10|29}}\n | Viewers=1.51<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-10-29-2016.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 10.29.2016|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|accessdate=November 25, 2016|work=ShowBuzzDaily|date=November 1, 2016}}</ref>\n  | ShortSummary=Musician Monsters: Conductro & Screech come and whoever listen to their music turns into a zombie, meanwhile Sledge returns from his presumed dead and mutinied against Arcanon. \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|List of Power Rangers Dino Super Charge episodes\n|EpisodeNumber=827\n |EpisodeNumber2=18\n | LineColor=0f9\n | Title=The Rangers Rock\n | DirectedBy=Michael Duignan\n | WrittenBy=Becca Barnes, Alwyn Dale, and Chip Lynn\n | OriginalAirDate= {{ Start date |2016|11|5}}<ref name=\"zap2it\">{{cite web|title=Power Rangers Dino Super Charge: Episode Guide|url=http://tvschedule.zap2it.com/tv/power-rangers-dino-super-charge/episode-guide/EP02339279?aid=tvschedule|website=Zap2it|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n | Viewers=1.38<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-5-2016.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.5.2016|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|accessdate=November 25, 2016|work=ShowBuzzDaily|date=November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n  | ShortSummary=A new monster: Badussa attacks the Rangers, turning most of them into stone.
