Kageyama is recognized nationally as one of the best setters, but he pushes his teammates harder than any of them think should take place.

Karasuno quick realizes they are in for an incredibly tough match, but things get worse when they found out that Atsumu Miya has a twin. \n\nTime is drawing closer to Karasuno and Inarizaki's match, and many are anticipating powerhouse Inarizaki's performance. Tanaka runs into Kanoka to clear up the misunderstanding with her cousin from last night. In the sub-arena, Karasuno is warming up in preparation. The team finds out about the popularity of their opponents and step on the court to deafening cheers for Inarizaki. \n\nThe match between Karasuno and Inarizaki finally begins. Miya Atsumu starts off with his powerful serves but not before he silences the cheering crowd. He requires absolute silence to concentrate and is annoyed at even the slightest disturbance. However, when it came to Karasuno's turn to serve, the Inarizaki cheering squad starts booing and heckling their opponents. As the game continues, Hinata managed to jump higher than he ever has before but gets completely caught up by the jump itself that he forgets to spike the ball. Although he received some harsh words from Kageyama, the setter were impressed by the fact that the apex of Hinata's jump changed so suddenly which attracted Inarizaki's attention. \n}}\n\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 74 (14)\n| Title               = Challengers\n| TranslitTitle       = Ch\u014dsen-sha\n| NativeTitle         = \u6311\u6226\u8005\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|7|3}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n<!--{}}\n{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 75 (15)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 76 (16)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 77 (17)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 78 (18)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 79 (19)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 80 (20)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 81 (21)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 82 (22)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 83 (23)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 84 (24)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 85 (25)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}-->\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Haikyu!! chapters|List of ''Haikyu!!'' chapters]]\n*[[List of Haikyu!! characters|List of ''Haikyu!!'' characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Haikyu!!'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haiky\u016b}}\n\n{{Haikyu!!}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Nihongo|'''''[[Haikyu!!]]'''''|\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!!}} is a Japanese [[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] [[manga]] series written and illustrated by Haruichi Furudate that revolves around a high school volleyball team and the relationship between players Hinata Sh\u014dy\u014d and Kageyama Tobio.

Three years later, he finally participates in his first ever volleyball match in junior high, but his first match is against Tobio Kageyama, a genius volleyball player known as \"King of the Court\". Kageyama is recognized nationally as one of the best setters, but he pushes his teammates harder than any of them think should take place. He calls Hinata useless and tries to prove up with continual blocks against him. However Hinata manages to score some points with his speed and route alterations.

For the last play, Sugawara joins the match as the pinch server, aiming to cause a disarray in their opponents formation. Both teams are refusing to give in, keeping up a good rally. Maruyama spikes the ball and it ricochets off the blockers but Sugawara covers it. The match ends with a finishing blow from Karasuno's ace, Asahi! Karasuno moves on to the second round!\n\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 72 (12)\n| Title               = Vivid\n| TranslitTitle       = Senretsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u9bae\u70c8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hideya It\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n| ShortSummary        = Karasuno has won their first match at nationals and will be moving on to the second round. Everyone celebrates and the two teams bow to each other and to the audience. Daichi also realized that the former Karasuno members were there to cheer them on the whole entire time. The third years get to catch up with their upperclassmen who are amazed by Karasuno's current first years. While Karasuno is eating lunch, they decide to watch Nekoma's first match. Nekoma wins their first match at nationals as well and will be moving on to the second round. \n\nMeanwhile on Court E, Fukur\u014ddani is just starting their first match against Eiwa and Bokuto is already in \"dejected mode\". However, the team is well-adapted and knows what to do while waiting for Bokuto to get over his slump. Once Bokuto regain his composure, he leads Fukur\u014ddani to an overwhelming victory over Eiwa. \n\nHinata, together with Yamaguchi, runs into Hoshiumi and immediately enters into a staring competition. Kageyama appears to introduce him as Kourai Hoshiumi, a member of the National Training Youth Camp. Hoshiumi questions Hinata about his position, height, and highest reaching point. Eventually Hoshiumi's teammate comes to get him, and the leave to get ready for their match. Karasuno members watch Hoshiumi's team, Kamomedai, and are amazed by his skill. Hoshiumi shows off his all-rounder prowess, leading the game commentators to call him the \"Small Giant\". Hinata is inspired by Hoshiumi's play and is glad they made it to nationals.\n\nIt is the end of the first day of the Spring Interhigh. Before Karasuno heads back to their lodging, they encounter their fated rival Nekoma. They greet each other with Daichi and Kuroo reminding the other to survive the next day before heading their own ways. Karasuno gets some much needed rest after an intense day before the team starts preparing for their next opponent. Meanwhile, Tanaka finally gets the chance to talk with his childhood friend, Kanoka Amanai. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 73 (13)\n| Title               = The Second Day\n| TranslitTitle       = Futsuka-me\n| NativeTitle         = 2\u65e5\u76ee\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|3}}\n| ShortSummary        = The night before the second day of nationals, Karasuno prepares to play against their next opponent. It turns out they are facing the runner-up of the Interhigh Tournament, Inarizaki High. Coach Ukai briefs the team about the players to look out for, especially Atsumu Miya who attended the Youth Training Camp with Kageyama. Karasuno quick realizes they are in for an incredibly tough match, but things get worse when they found out that Atsumu Miya has a twin. \n\nTime is drawing closer to Karasuno and Inarizaki's match, and many are anticipating powerhouse Inarizaki's performance. Tanaka runs into Kanoka to clear up the misunderstanding with her cousin from last night. In the sub-arena, Karasuno is warming up in preparation. The team finds out about the popularity of their opponents and step on the court to deafening cheers for Inarizaki. \n\nThe match between Karasuno and Inarizaki finally begins. Miya Atsumu starts off with his powerful serves but not before he silences the cheering crowd. He requires absolute silence to concentrate and is annoyed at even the slightest disturbance. However, when it came to Karasuno's turn to serve, the Inarizaki cheering squad starts booing and heckling their opponents. As the game continues, Hinata managed to jump higher than he ever has before but gets completely caught up by the jump itself that he forgets to spike the ball. Although he received some harsh words from Kageyama, the setter were impressed by the fact that the apex of Hinata's jump changed so suddenly which attracted Inarizaki's attention. \n}}\n\n===Season 4 (Haikyu!!

In particular, the length of the first vowel is not determined in the original sources. Some scholars prefer the reading '''Ni\u00f0h\u00f6ggr''' (''Striker in the Dark'').</ref>) is a [[Norse dragon|dragon]]/[[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] who gnaws at a root of the [[world tree]], [[Yggdrasil]]. In historical [[Vikings|Viking]] society, [[N\u012b\u00fe|n\u00ed\u00f0]] was a term for itiofuoqieqfojvwrofjkajfofadqioriofu,photojournalism\n\n\n\ns cajlsgokfovkodokogkrokga social stigma implying the loss of honor and the status of a villain. Thus, its name might refer to its role as a horrific monster in its action of chewing the corpses of the inhabitants of [[N\u00e1str\u00f6nd]]: those guilty of murder, adultery, and oath-breaking, which Norse society considered among the worst possible.\n\n==Orthography==\n\nIn the standardized [[Old Norse orthography]], the name is spelled ''{{lang|non|N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr}}'', but the letter ''{{lang|non|[[\u01eb]]}}'' is frequently replaced with the Modern Icelandic ''{{lang|is|[[\u00f6]]}}'' for reasons of familiarity or technical expediency.\n\nThe name can be [[Old Norse orthography#Anglicized spelling|represented in English texts]] with ''i'' for ''\u00ed''; ''th'', ''d'' or (rarely) ''dh'' for ''\u00f0''; ''o'' for ''\u01eb'' and optionally without ''r'' as in Modern Scandinavian reflexes. The [[Icelandic language|Modern Icelandic]] form ''{{lang|is|N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggur}}'' is also sometimes seen, with special characters or similarly anglicized. The [[Danish language|Danish]] forms ''{{lang|da|Nidhug}}'' and ''{{lang|da|Nidh\u00f8g}}'' can also be encountered; or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''{{lang|no|Nidhogg}}'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{lang|sv|Nidh\u00f6gg}}''.\n\n==Prose Edda==\n\nAccording to the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' part of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Prose Edda]]'', N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr is a being which gnaws one of the three roots of [[Yggdrasill]]. It is sometimes believed that the roots are trapping the beast from the world. This root is placed over [[Niflheimr]] and N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr gnaws it from beneath. The same source also says that \"[t]he squirrel called [[Ratatoskr]] runs up and down the length of the Ash, bearing envious words between the [[Ve\u00f0rf\u00f6lnir and eagle|eagle]] and N\u00eddh\u01ebggr [the snake].\"<ref>''Gylfaginning'' XVI, Brodeur's translation.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' section of the ''Prose Edda'' Snorri specifies N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr as a serpent in a list of names of such creatures:\n\n:These are names for serpents: dragon, Fafnir, Jormungand, adder, Nidhogg, snake, viper, Goin, Moin, Grafvitnir, Grabak, Ofnir, Svafnir, masked one.<ref>Faulkes translation, p.137</ref>\n\nSnorri's knowledge of N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr seems to come from two of the [[Eddic poem]]s: ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'' and ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''.\n\nLater in ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', Snorri includes N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr in a list of various terms and names for swords.<ref>Faulkes translation, p.159</ref>\n\n==Poetic Edda==\n\nThe poem ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' identifies a number of beings which live in Yggdrasill. The tree suffers great hardship from all the creatures which live on it. The poem identifies N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr as tearing at the tree from beneath and also mentions Ratatoskr as carrying messages between N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr and the eagle who lives at the top of the tree. Snorri Sturluson often quotes Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l and clearly used it as his source for this information.\n\nThe poem ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'' mentions N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr/N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr twice. The first instance is in its description of [[N\u00e1str\u00f6nd]].\n\n{| width=\"99%\"\n! width=\"33%\" | [http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/ugm/vsp3.html Eysteinn Bj\u00f6rnsson's edition]\n! width=\"33%\" | [http://www.voluspa.org/voluspa36-40.htm Bellows' translation]\n! width=\"33%\" | [[Ursula Dronke|Dronke]]'s translation\n|-\n|\n:Sal s\u00e1 hon standa \n:s\u00f3lu fjarri \n:N\u00e1str\u00f6ndu \u00e1,\n:nor\u00f0r horfa dyrr. \n:Fellu eitrdropar \n:inn um lj\u00f3ra, \n:s\u00e1 er undinn salr\n:orma hryggjum.\n\n:S\u00e1 hon \u00fear va\u00f0a\n:\u00feunga strauma\n:menn meinsvara\n:ok mor\u00f0varga\n:ok \u00feanns annars glepr\n:eyrar\u00fanu.\n:\u00dear saug Ni\u00f0h\u00f6ggr\n:n\u00e1i framgengna,\n:sleit vargr vera\u2014\n:vitu\u00f0 \u00e9r enn, e\u00f0a hvat ?\n|\n:A hall I saw, \n:far from the sun,\n:On Nastrond it stands,\n:and the doors face north,\n:Venom drops\n:through the smoke-vent down,\n:For around the walls\n:do serpents wind.\n\n:I there saw wading\n:through rivers wild\n:treacherous men\n:and murderers too,\n:And workers of ill \n:with the wives of men;\n:There Nithhogg sucked\n:the blood of the slain,\n:And the wolf tore men;\n:would you know yet more?\n|\n:A hall she saw standing\n:remote from the sun\n:on Dead Body Shore.\n:Its door looks north.\n:There fell drops of venom\n:in through the roof vent.\n:That hall is woven\n:of serpents' spines.\n\n:She saw there wading\n:onerous streams\n:men perjured\n:and wolfish murderers\n:and the one who seduces\n:another's close-trusted wife.\n:There Malice Striker sucked\n:corpses of the dead,\n:the wolf tore men.\n:Do you still seek to know?

The most prevalent opinion is that the arrival of N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr heralds [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] and thus that the poem ends on a tone of ominous warning. It could be, however, as the prevalent themes of Norse mythology are those of change and renewal, that this could be a 'redemption' of the serpent, 'shedding' the corpses and beginning life anew, much like a macabre Phoenix, or perhaps, lifting the bodies of the righteous rulers mentioned two stanzas before (the stanza immediately before is considered spurious by translator Henry Adam Bellows), so that they can dwell in Gimle, and then either N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr sinks, or the v\u00f6lva sinks, depending on the translation, and the poem ends.\n\nN\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr is not mentioned elsewhere in any ancient source.\n\n==Modern culture==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=September 2018}}\nThe Nidhogg appears in games such as ''[[Fate of the Norns]],''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valkauskas|first1=Andrew|title=Denizens of the North|date=2015|publisher=Pendelhaven|location=Canada|isbn=9780986541469|pages=96\u201397|edition=1st}}</ref>''[[Tower of Saviors]]'','' ''[[Age of Mythology]],'' ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]],'' ''[[Megami Tensei]],'' ''[[World of Warcraft]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=107544/nithogg|title=Nithogg|newspaper=Wowhead|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref> [[Ragnarok Online]], and the 2014 indie fencing game [[Nidhogg (video game)|Nidhogg]], as well as its 2017 sequel, [[Nidhogg 2]].\n\nAlthough not in the game, Nidhogg is shown as a comparison for Alduin, the main antagonist of [[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], in the sense both feed on the dead and are the symbols of destruction. In Alduin's case he feeds on the souls of the dead in Sovngarde, the afterlife of the natives of Skyrim and is prophecised to bring the end of the world, gaining the title World-Eater which could be a reference to Nidhogg's gnawing at the roots of Yggdrasil.\n\nIn ''[[Eve Online]]'', a class of capital ships, the Minmatar carrier, are called Nidhoggur. The Minmatar Republic in the game often uses Norse mythology in ship class names, such as Loki, Hel, and Ragnarok.\n\nNidhogg is the subject of the song \"On a Sea of Blood\" from the album ''Jomsviking'' by Swedish [[melodic death metal]] band ''[[Amon Amarth]]''.\n\nAnother reference, albeit small, is the 50% form of  [[Zygarde]], a serpentine style [[Pok\u00e9mon]] known as the Order Pok\u00e9mon. This goes along with [[Xerneas]], the Life Pok\u00e9mon, being the stag of life, [[Dvalinn]], and [[Yveltal]], the Destruction Pok\u00e9mon, being [[Hraesvelgr]].\n\nNi\u00f0h\u00f6ggr appears in [[Ichiei Ishibumi]]'s light novel series ''[[High School DxD]]''.\n\nNidhogg is also the name of a bow in both ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem Heroes]]''.\n\nNidhogg appears as a monster in the fantasy book ''[[The Magician: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]'' by Michael Scott.\n\nIn the Korean manhwa, [[Ragnarok: Into the Abyss]], Nidhogg is featured as the Queen of Dragons who is able to destroy an army of Titans under the control of Valkyrie Sarah Irine. It also appears in the Korean web novel The Book Eating Magician.\n\nNidhogg's eye is the button found in a carving of Yggdrasil the Red Skull pushes to reveal the Tesseract in the Marvel film [[Captain America: The First Avenger]].\n\nIn 2018 Philippine TV Series [[Victor Magtanggol]], Nidhogg is a type of serpent with small arms and bat-like wings. He is Loki's pet, adviser, messenger and right hand which tell him what to do and how to help him defeat his enemies.\n\nNi\u00f0h\u00f6ggr is seen gnawing the root of Yggdrasil in the 2015 game [[Jotun (video game)|Jotun]] during a section of the game taking place in the roots of Yggdrasil\n\nNidhogg appears as a sub-boss in the Roots of Yggdrasil in the 2018 game ''[[La-Mulana 2]]''.\n\nIn the 2019 video game [[Devil May Cry 5]], the Nidhogg parasite helps you progress through the story by killing parts of the demon trees roots. This may be a direct reference to the [[Yggdrasil]] and how Nidhogg eats its roots. Nidhogg is also a boss fight in this video game.\n\n<br />\n\n==See also==\n* [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]\n* [[Serpents_in_the_Bible#Eden|Nachash]] - the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons category}}\n* \u00c1sgeir Bl\u00f6ndal Magn\u00fasson (1989).

In particular, the length of the first vowel is not determined in the original sources. Some scholars prefer the reading '''Ni\u00f0h\u00f6ggr''' (''Striker in the Dark'').</ref>) is a [[Norse dragon|dragon]]/[[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] who gnaws at a root of the [[world tree]], [[Yggdrasil]]. In historical [[Vikings|Viking]] society, [[N\u012b\u00fe|n\u00ed\u00f0]] was a term for a social stigma implying the loss of honor and the status of a villain. Thus, its name might refer to its role as a horrific monster in its action of chewing the corpses of the inhabitants of [[N\u00e1str\u00f6nd]]: those guilty of murder, adultery, and oath-breaking, which Norse society considered among the worst possible.\n\n==Orthography==\n\nIn the standardized [[Old Norse orthography]], the name is spelled ''{{lang|non|N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr}}'', but the letter ''{{lang|non|[[\u01eb]]}}'' is frequently replaced with the Modern Icelandic ''{{lang|is|[[\u00f6]]}}'' for reasons of familiarity or technical expediency.\n\nThe name can be [[Old Norse orthography#Anglicized spelling|represented in English texts]] with ''i'' for ''\u00ed''; ''th'', ''d'' or (rarely) ''dh'' for ''\u00f0''; ''o'' for ''\u01eb'' and optionally without ''r'' as in Modern Scandinavian reflexes. The [[Icelandic language|Modern Icelandic]] form ''{{lang|is|N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggur}}'' is also sometimes seen, with special characters or similarly anglicized. The [[Danish language|Danish]] forms ''{{lang|da|Nidhug}}'' and ''{{lang|da|Nidh\u00f8g}}'' can also be encountered; or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''{{lang|no|Nidhogg}}'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{lang|sv|Nidh\u00f6gg}}''.\n\n==Prose Edda==\n\nAccording to the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' part of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Prose Edda]]'', N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr is a being which gnaws one of the three roots of [[Yggdrasill]]. It is sometimes believed that the roots are trapping the beast from the world. This root is placed over [[Niflheimr]] and N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr gnaws it from beneath. The same source also says that \"[t]he squirrel called [[Ratatoskr]] runs up and down the length of the Ash, bearing envious words between the [[Ve\u00f0rf\u00f6lnir and eagle|eagle]] and N\u00eddh\u01ebggr [the snake].\"<ref>''Gylfaginning'' XVI, Brodeur's translation.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' section of the ''Prose Edda'' Snorri specifies N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr as a serpent in a list of names of such creatures:\n\n:These are names for serpents: dragon, Fafnir, Jormungand, adder, Nidhogg, snake, viper, Goin, Moin, Grafvitnir, Grabak, Ofnir, Svafnir, masked one.<ref>Faulkes translation, p.137</ref>\n\nSnorri's knowledge of N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr seems to come from two of the [[Eddic poem]]s: ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'' and ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''.\n\nLater in ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', Snorri includes N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr in a list of various terms and names for swords.<ref>Faulkes translation, p.159</ref>\n\n==Poetic Edda==\n\nThe poem ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' identifies a number of beings which live in Yggdrasill. The tree suffers great hardship from all the creatures which live on it. The poem identifies N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr as tearing at the tree from beneath and also mentions Ratatoskr as carrying messages between N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr and the eagle who lives at the top of the tree. Snorri Sturluson often quotes Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l and clearly used it as his source for this information.\n\nThe poem ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'' mentions N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr/N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr twice. The first instance is in its description of [[N\u00e1str\u00f6nd]].\n\n{| width=\"99%\"\n! width=\"33%\" | [http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/ugm/vsp3.html Eysteinn Bj\u00f6rnsson's edition]\n! width=\"33%\" | [http://www.voluspa.org/voluspa36-40.htm Bellows' translation]\n! width=\"33%\" | [[Ursula Dronke|Dronke]]'s translation\n|-\n|\n:Sal s\u00e1 hon standa \n:s\u00f3lu fjarri \n:N\u00e1str\u00f6ndu \u00e1,\n:nor\u00f0r horfa dyrr. \n:Fellu eitrdropar \n:inn um lj\u00f3ra, \n:s\u00e1 er undinn salr\n:orma hryggjum.\n\n:S\u00e1 hon \u00fear va\u00f0a\n:\u00feunga strauma\n:menn meinsvara\n:ok mor\u00f0varga\n:ok \u00feanns annars glepr\n:eyrar\u00fanu.\n:\u00dear saug Ni\u00f0h\u00f6ggr\n:n\u00e1i framgengna,\n:sleit vargr vera\u2014\n:vitu\u00f0 \u00e9r enn, e\u00f0a hvat ?\n|\n:A hall I saw, \n:far from the sun,\n:On Nastrond it stands,\n:and the doors face north,\n:Venom drops\n:through the smoke-vent down,\n:For around the walls\n:do serpents wind.\n\n:I there saw wading\n:through rivers wild\n:treacherous men\n:and murderers too,\n:And workers of ill \n:with the wives of men;\n:There Nithhogg sucked\n:the blood of the slain,\n:And the wolf tore men;\n:would you know yet more?\n|\n:A hall she saw standing\n:remote from the sun\n:on Dead Body Shore.\n:Its door looks north.\n:There fell drops of venom\n:in through the roof vent.\n:That hall is woven\n:of serpents' spines.\n\n:She saw there wading\n:onerous streams\n:men perjured\n:and wolfish murderers\n:and the one who seduces\n:another's close-trusted wife.\n:There Malice Striker sucked\n:corpses of the dead,\n:the wolf tore men.\n:Do you still seek to know?

The most prevalent opinion is that the arrival of N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr heralds [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] and thus that the poem ends on a tone of ominous warning. It could be, however, as the prevalent themes of Norse mythology are those of change and renewal, that this could be a 'redemption' of the serpent, 'shedding' the corpses and beginning life anew, much like a macabre Phoenix, or perhaps, lifting the bodies of the righteous rulers mentioned two stanzas before (the stanza immediately before is considered spurious by translator Henry Adam Bellows), so that they can dwell in Gimle, and then either N\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr sinks, or the v\u00f6lva sinks, depending on the translation, and the poem ends.\n\nN\u00ed\u00f0h\u01ebggr is not mentioned elsewhere in any ancient source.\n\n==Modern culture==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=September 2018}}\nThe Nidhogg appears in games such as ''[[Fate of the Norns]],''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valkauskas|first1=Andrew|title=Denizens of the North|date=2015|publisher=Pendelhaven|location=Canada|isbn=9780986541469|pages=96\u201397|edition=1st}}</ref>''[[Tower of Saviors]]'','' ''[[Age of Mythology]],'' ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]],'' ''[[Megami Tensei]],'' ''[[World of Warcraft]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=107544/nithogg|title=Nithogg|newspaper=Wowhead|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref> [[Ragnarok Online]], and the 2014 indie fencing game [[Nidhogg (video game)|Nidhogg]], as well as its 2017 sequel, [[Nidhogg 2]].\n\nAlthough not in the game, Nidhogg is shown as a comparison for Alduin, the main antagonist of [[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], in the sense both feed on the dead and are the symbols of destruction. In Alduin's case he feeds on the souls of the dead in Sovngarde, the afterlife of the natives of Skyrim and is prophecised to bring the end of the world, gaining the title World-Eater which could be a reference to Nidhogg's gnawing at the roots of Yggdrasil.\n\nIn ''[[Eve Online]]'', a class of capital ships, the Minmatar carrier, are called Nidhoggur. The Minmatar Republic in the game often uses Norse mythology in ship class names, such as Loki, Hel, and Ragnarok.\n\nNidhogg is the subject of the song \"On a Sea of Blood\" from the album ''Jomsviking'' by Swedish [[melodic death metal]] band ''[[Amon Amarth]]''.\n\nAnother reference, albeit small, is the 50% form of  [[Zygarde]], a serpentine style [[Pok\u00e9mon]] known as the Order Pok\u00e9mon. This goes along with [[Xerneas]], the Life Pok\u00e9mon, being the stag of life, [[Dvalinn]], and [[Yveltal]], the Destruction Pok\u00e9mon, being [[Hraesvelgr]].\n\nNi\u00f0h\u00f6ggr appears in [[Ichiei Ishibumi]]'s light novel series ''[[High School DxD]]''.\n\nNidhogg is also the name of a bow in both ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem Heroes]]''.\n\nNidhogg appears as a monster in the fantasy book ''[[The Magician: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]'' by Michael Scott.\n\nIn the Korean manhwa, [[Ragnarok: Into the Abyss]], Nidhogg is featured as the Queen of Dragons who is able to destroy an army of Titans under the control of Valkyrie Sarah Irine. It also appears in the Korean web novel The Book Eating Magician.\n\nNidhogg's eye is the button found in a carving of Yggdrasil the Red Skull pushes to reveal the Tesseract in the Marvel film [[Captain America: The First Avenger]].\n\nIn 2018 Philippine TV Series [[Victor Magtanggol]], Nidhogg is a type of serpent with small arms and bat-like wings. He is Loki's pet, adviser, messenger and right hand which tell him what to do and how to help him defeat his enemies.\n\nNi\u00f0h\u00f6ggr is seen gnawing the root of Yggdrasil in the 2015 game [[Jotun (video game)|Jotun]] during a section of the game taking place in the roots of Yggdrasil\n\nNidhogg appears as a sub-boss in the Roots of Yggdrasil in the 2018 game ''[[La-Mulana 2]]''.\n\nIn the 2019 video game [[Devil May Cry 5]], the Nidhogg parasite helps you progress through the story by killing parts of the demon trees roots. This may be a direct reference to the [[Yggdrasil]] and how Nidhogg eats its roots. Nidhogg is also a boss fight in this video game.\n\n<br />\n\n==See also==\n* [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]\n* [[Serpents_in_the_Bible#Eden|Nachash]] - the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons category}}\n* \u00c1sgeir Bl\u00f6ndal Magn\u00fasson (1989).

Their mission, and their motto was to \"Incite, Subvert, Provoke and Organize.\" Each episode began with news coverage of lesbian-related issues. Then, the episode covered diverse aspects of different lesbian communities, including art, health, politics, music, sports, etc.<ref name=\"Smith\" />  Those featured in the episodes came from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, highlighting intersectional issues within the lesbian community.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s was a pivotal time for the [[LGBT community]], with the rise of [[HIV/AIDS]] and the rise of [[ACT UP]], the [[Riot grrrl]] Movement and [[Queercore]], the murder of [[Brandon Teena]], and pro and anti LGBTQ+ legislation across the country, including [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)]].<ref name=\"Smith\" />  Many of these issues were not discussed widely in mainstream news. Of the LGBTQ+ news that was discussed, the issues of cisgender gay men were highlighted, leaving behind much of the Queer community. Founder Linda Chapman remarked, Co-founder Ana Simo \"was looking for a better way to promote Lesbian Avengers and this seemed really ideal.\u201d solidifying Dyke TV's position as fundamentally activism oriented.<ref>Brownworth, Victoria A., I Want My Dyke TV, Deneuve October 1994 volume 4 #5</ref> Thus, Dyke TV was pivotal in highlighting often-unseen LGBTQ+ issues and news, particularly within the lesbian community.\n\n== Participation == \nDyke TV was almost entirely run on volunteers, with only three paid staff members, everything from networking and fundraising to production and distribution was volunteer based. Episodes were filmed, hosted and produced in New York City at the Dyke TV studio, but most segments were sent in from volunteer stringers and correspondents from across the country.\n\n== Segments ==\n\n=== News ===\nCoverage ranged from international issues like the war is Bosnia and Herzegovina to domestic LGBT issues, particularly those that affect lesbians including the political debates around marriage and Don't Ask Don't Tell. In line with the shows activist sensibilities, Dyke TV strove to report underrepresented cases of violence against Lesbians, Gay Men and Trans people. From the firebombing of Lesbian AIDS activist Dee Deberry's home in Tampa Florida<ref>Dyke TV Records Finding Aid, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass.</ref>, to the racially motivated murder by firebomb of a Lesbian Hattie Mae Cohens and a Gay man, Brian Mock, at their home Salem Oregon<ref>\"2 Guilty of Murder in Racial Killings\" The Seattle Times, Seattle April 9, 1993</ref>. \nDocumenting the activism of the radical queer organisations was a central goal of the show. The direct action tactics of the Lesbian Avengers were covered weekly on the news. \n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Arts showcased lesbian work in the art world through interviews of artists or reporting on festivals and events. The segment ran new features weekly and was hosted by poet and performance artist [[Pamela Sneed]]. Notable features include filmmaker [[Cheryl Dunye]], Actress and performance artist [[Carmelita Tropicana]] and Singer [[Ani Difranco]].<ref>Dyke TV Records Finding Aid, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass.</ref>\n\n=== I Was a Lesbian Child ===\nThe popular segment \u201cI was a lesbian child\u201d featured the childhood photos and home videos of viewers and contributors. Those featured provided humorous voice overs narrating their childhoods and emphasising that they had always been gay. The name of the segment came from a 1992 Lesbian Avengers campaign to push for the gay and lesbian inclusive \u201cRainbow Curriculum\u201d in New York City public schools, where they wore T-shirts proclaiming \u201cI was a lesbian child.\u201d<ref>Rand, ErinJ. 2013. \u201cAn Appetite for Activism: The Lesbian Avengers and the Queer Politics of Visibility.\u201d Women\u2019s Studies in Communication 36 (2): 121\u201341. doi:10.1080/07491409.2013.794754.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Their mission, and their motto was to \"Incite, Subvert, Provoke and Organize.\" Each episode began with news coverage of lesbian-related issues. Then, the episode covered diverse aspects of different lesbian communities, including art, health, politics, music, sports, etc.<ref name=\"Smith\" />  Those featured in the episodes came from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, highlighting intersectional issues within the lesbian community.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s was a pivotal time for the [[LGBT community]], with the rise of [[HIV/AIDS]] and the rise of [[ACT UP]], the [[Riot grrrl]] Movement and [[Queercore]], the murder of [[Brandon Teena]], and pro and anti LGBTQ+ legislation across the country, including [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)]].<ref name=\"Smith\" />  Many of these issues were not discussed widely in mainstream news. Of the LGBTQ+ news that was discussed, the issues of cisgender gay men were highlighted, leaving behind much of the Queer community. Founder Linda Chapman remarked, Co-founder Ana Simo \"was looking for a better way to promote Lesbian Avengers and this seemed really ideal.\u201d solidifying Dyke TV's position as fundamentally activism oriented.<ref>Brownworth, Victoria A., I Want My Dyke TV, Deneuve October 1994 volume 4 #5</ref> Thus, Dyke TV was pivotal in highlighting often-unseen LGBTQ+ issues and news, particularly within the lesbian community.\n\n== Participation == \nDyke TV was almost entirely run on volunteers, with only three paid staff members, everything from networking and fundraising to production and distribution was volunteer based. Episodes were filmed, hosted and produced in New York City at the Dyke TV studio, but most segments were sent in from volunteer stringers and correspondants from across the country.\n\n== Segments ==\n\n=== News ===\nCoverage ranged from international issues like the war is Bosnia and Herzegovina to domestic LGBT issues, particularly those that affect lesbians including the political debates around marriage and Don't Ask Don't Tell. In line with the shows activist sensibilities, Dyke TV strove to report underrepresented cases of violence against Lesbians, Gay Men and Trans people. From the firebombing of Lesbian AIDS activist Dee Deberry\u2019s home in Tampa Florida<ref>Dyke TV Records Finding Aid, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass.</ref>, to the racially motivated murder by firebomb of a Lesbian Hattie Mae Cohens and a Gay man, Brian Mock, at their home Salem Oregon<ref>\"2 Guilty of Murder in Racial Killings\" The Seattle Times, Seattle April 9, 1993</ref>. \nDocumenting the activism of the radical queer organisations was a central goal of the show. The direct action tactics of the Lesbian Avengers were covered weekly on the news. \n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Arts showcased lesbian work in the art world through interviews of artists or reporting on festivals and events. The segment ran new features weekly and was hosted by poet and performance artist [[Pamela Sneed]]. Notable features include filmmaker [[Cheryl Dunye]], Actress and performance artist [[Carmelita Tropicana]] and Singer [[Ani Difranco]].<ref>Dyke TV Records Finding Aid, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass.</ref>\n\n=== I Was a Lesbian Child ===\nThe popular segment \u201cI was a lesbian child\u201d featured the childhood photos and home videos of viewers and contributors. Those featured provided humorous voice overs narrating their childhoods and emphasising that they had always been gay. The name of the segment came from a 1992 Lesbian Avengers campaign to push for the gay and lesbian inclusive \u201cRainbow Curriculum\u201d in New York City public schools, where they wore T-shirts proclaiming \u201cI was a lesbian child.\u201d<ref>Rand, ErinJ. 2013. \u201cAn Appetite for Activism: The Lesbian Avengers and the Queer Politics of Visibility.\u201d Women\u2019s Studies in Communication 36 (2): 121\u201341. doi:10.1080/07491409.2013.794754.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The show consisted mainly of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] that were full of [[slapstick]], [[mime]], [[parody]] and [[double entendre]]. \n\nAt its peak ''The Benny Hill Show'' was among the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#United Kingdom|most-watched programmes]] in the UK with the audience reaching more than 21 million viewers in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html |title=Features &#124; Britain's Most Watched TV &#124; 1970s |publisher=British Film Institute (BFI) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122221511/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html |archive-date=22 November 2005 |access-date=22 October 2016}}</ref> [[Thames Television]] cancelled production of the show in 1989 due to declining ratings and large production costs at \u00a3450,000 ({{Inflation|UK|450,000|1989|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) per show. In a 2015 UK poll the show's theme song was voted number 1 on the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] special ''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Sound of ITV \u2013 The Nation's Favourite Theme Tune]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week38/sound-itv-nations-favourite-theme-tune|title=The Sound of ITV: The Nation\u2019s Favourite Theme Tunes Episode 1|publisher=itv.com|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Show format==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n''The Benny Hill Show'' features Benny Hill in various short comedy sketches and occasional, extravagant musical performances by artists of the time. Hill appears in many different costumes and portrays a vast array of characters. [[Slapstick]], [[burlesque]] and [[double entendre]]s are his hallmarks. A group of critics accused the show of [[sexism]], and Hill responded by claiming that female characters kept their dignity while the men who chase them were portrayed as [[buffoon]]s.\n\nThe show often uses [[undercranking]] and [[sight gag]]s to create what Hill called \"live animation\", and he employs comedic techniques such as mime and parody. The show typically closes with a sped-up chase scene involving Hill and often a crew of scantily clad women (usually with Hill being the one chased, due to silly predicaments that he himself caused), a send-up on the stereotypical [[Keystone Cops]] chase scenes. Hill also composed and sang [[patter song]]s and often entertained his audience with lengthy high-speed double-entendre rhymes and songs, which he recited or sang in a single take.\n\nHill also used the television camera to create comedic illusions. For example, in a murder mystery farce entitled \"Murder on the Oregon Express\" from 1976 (a parody of ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''), Hill used editing, camera angles and impersonations to depict a [[Quinn Martin]]\u2013like TV \"mystery\" featuring Hill in the roles of 1970s American television detectives ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', plus [[Hercule Poirot]].\n\nDuring his television career, Hill performed impersonations or parodies of such American celebrities as [[W. C. Fields]], [[Orson Welles]] (renamed \"Orson Buggy\"), [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Raymond Burr]], and fictional characters that range from ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'' to ''[[The A-Team]]'' (parodied as \"The B-Team\", in which he played the roles of both 'Hannibal' and 'B.A.') and ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]''. He also impersonated such international celebrities as [[Nana Mouskouri]] and [[Miriam Makeba]] as well as British stars such as [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Michael Caine]] (in his ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' role), newscasters [[Reginald Bosanquet]], [[Alan Whicker]] and [[Cliff Michelmore]], pop-music show hosts [[Jimmy Savile]] and [[Tony Blackburn]], musician [[Roger Whittaker]], his former 1960s record producer [[Tony Hatch]], political figures [[Robert Boothby, Baron Boothby|Lord Boothby]] and [[Denis Healey]] and Irish comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]]. On a few occasions, Hill even impersonated his former straight man, [[Nicholas Parsons]]. A spoof of ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' saw him playing both [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].\n\n==Production notes==\nThe show's closing theme tune, \"[[Yakety Sax]]\", which has gained a following in its own right, was written by James Q. \"Spider\" Rich and [[Boots Randolph]]. As the closing credits rolled, the theme was usually accompanied by a sped-up chase-sequence, often featuring scantily clad young women. The show's musical director was pianist and easy listening conductor [[Ronnie Aldrich]], and vocal backing was provided by [[Session musician|session singers]] [[the Ladybirds]] (who also frequently appeared on camera from 1969 to 1974). The saxophone soloist on Aldrich's version of \"Yakety Sax\" was Peter Hughes. For three episodes of the 1973\u20131974 season, [[Albert Elms]] filled in for Aldrich as musical director. \"Yakety Sax\" first appeared in the 19 November 1969 episode, which was also the first show for Thames.\n\nAnother signature of the show was the enthusiastic announcer intro: \"Yes! It's ''The Benny Hill Show!''\" (The announcer was often cast member [[Henry McGee]].) From 1975 forward, Hill was also introduced at the start of each show as \"The Lad Himself\". The show closed with Hill's salute: \"Thank you for being with us, and we look forward to seeing you all again\u2014very, very soon. Until then, bye bye.\".\n\n==Cast==\nThe main supporting cast includes [[Henry McGee]], Jon Jon Keefe, [[Nicholas Parsons]], [[Bob Todd]] and [[Jackie Wright]].\n\nThe regular sexpot-type females include [[Jenny Lee-Wright]], [[Sue Bond]], [[Bettina Le Beau]], [[Lesley Goldie]], [[Cherri Gilham]] and [[Diana Darvey]]. In later years, the show included a dance troupe, the Hill's Angels, which was briefly preceded by the Love Machine. Regular Angels were [[Sue Upton]] and [[Louise English]], whilst [[Jane Leeves]] also appeared as a Hill's Angel in a few episodes in the early 1980s; among those who appeared only once were Susan Clark and [[Sue McIntosh]].\n\nThe female singing group [[The Ladybirds]], featuring the bespectacled Maggie Stredder, were regulars on the show as background singers to Hill, and occasionally singing numbers on their own.\n\nCharacter actresses include [[Anna Dawson]], [[Bella Emberg]], [[Rita Webb]] and [[Patricia Hayes]].\n\n===Guest stars===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Don Estelle]]\n* [[Paul Eddington]]\n* [[Paula Wilcox]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Patrick Newell]]\n* [[Hugh Paddick]]\n* [[Kathy Staff]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Trisha Noble]]\n* [[Dilys Watling]]\n* [[Stella Moray]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Percy Thrower]]\n* [[Liz Fraser]]\n* [[Carl Wayne]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\nOccasionally, Hill would briefly chat with his guests on stage.  In the 1980s, as the climate of [[political correctness]] continued to grow, Eddington and Wilcox refused to allow the episodes in which they appeared to be shown on British television again.\n\n===Musical guest stars===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Petula Clark]]\n* [[Alma Cogan]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Kiki Dee]]\n* [[Judith Durham]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Cleo Laine]]\n* [[Mike Sammes|The Mike Sammes Singers]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]]\n* [[The Springfields]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Design (UK band)|Design]]\n* [[Sylvia McNeill]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\nHill also gave the first major exposure to some non-UK-based musical groups, including [[Luis Alberto del Paran\u00e1]] and [[Los Paraguayos]]. With few exceptions, most of the musical numbers did not make it to the U.S. syndicated series.\n\n==International airings==\nIn the late 1970s, Thames Television purchased a week of transmission time on two stations owned by [[RKO General]] that were offering a \"Thames Week\" schedule and were in the two largest American television markets: [[New York City]]'s [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV|KHJ-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]. This introduced the show to American audiences and became immediately popular; subsequent screenings involved a series of re-edited half-hour programmes culled from the [[ITV Network|ITV]] specials. As a result of heavy editing for fear of [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] licence revocation, the early US versions of the show have far less risqu\u00e9 material than those broadcast in the UK, though some brief female nudity and subtle sexual innuendo was apparently acceptable.\n\nThe show was awarded the 'Special Prize of the City of Montreux' at the [[Rose d'Or]] festival in 1984. Selected sketches from the first four years (1969\u20131972) of the Thames run were also edited into a feature film, ''[[The Best of Benny Hill]]'' (1974).\n\nIn 1977, Hill produced a special in [[Australia]] ''(see below)'' that provided material for some scattered episodes of the U.S. half-hour syndicated edits. The cast of that Australian show included [[Barry Otto]] and [[Ron Shand]].\n\nThe programme also aired on [[GBC TV]] in the British Overseas territory of [[Gibraltar]].\n\nIn Spain, the programme was immensely popular in the early 1980s. With the arrival of the commercial stations, [[Telecinco]], in its first guise, depended heavily on old programming, and ''The Benny Hill Show'' would usually air for 60\u201390 minutes every night before the 20:30 news programme.\n\n===Repeats===\n''The Benny Hill Show'' aired in one-hour portions (not corresponding to the original hour-long format), twice nightly on [[BBC America]] from October 2004 to April 2007, restoring much of the mature content not seen in previous American airings (as such, most airings had a [[TV Parental Guidelines|rating]] of TV-MA){{cn|date=February 2018}} but also excising most of the musical segments. Half-hour edits also appeared on ITV.\n\nAs of July 2014, the show is being broadcast on [[Australia]]'s [[7Two]]. The show has also been aired in [[India]] on [[UTV (India)|UTV]], dubbed in various Indian languages.\n\n[[Antenna TV]], a network created for [[digital subchannels]] in the [[United States]], started showing the show Friday and Saturday nights in three hour blocks on New Year's Day, 1 January 2011. This version, while generally following the half-hour syndicated format, included many of the musical numbers.\n\nAs of 2017, the show is currently being broadcast on Makedonia TV (M.tv) in Greece.\n\n==Cancellation==\nIn June 1989, Thames Television's Head of Light Entertainment since March 1988, [[John Howard Davies]], invited Hill in for a meeting. Having just returned from a triumphant [[Cannes]] TV festival, Hill assumed that they were to discuss details of a new series. Instead, Davies informed Hill that his programme would discontinue production, and that he was dismissing Hill himself. In an episode about Hill from the documentary series ''Living Famously'', Davies stated there were three reasons why he did so: \"the audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired.\" All of which was untrue.\n\nAt its peak in 1977, 21.10 million viewers watched Hill's show. In 1989, the last Thames episode attracted 9.58 million viewers. However, this reason for the cancellation has been disputed{{who|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Despite declining ratings in the UK, the show was still one of Britain's most successful TV exports, airing in 97 other countries [http://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/the-truth-about-benny-hill].\n\n==Programme list==\n* ''The Benny Hill Show'', broadcast on BBC1 (1955, 1957\u20131958, 1961, 1964\u20131966, 1968) \u2013 32 episodes were made (''in black & white'').\n* ''The Benny Hill Show'', made by ATV and broadcast on ITV (1957\u20131960, 1967) \u2013 Nine episodes were made (''in b&w'').\n* ''The Benny Hill Show'', made by Thames and broadcast on ITV (1969\u20131986, 1988\u20131989) \u2013 58 episodes were made (''in colour, except ep. 6-8'').\n* ''Benny Hill Down Under'' \u2013 1977 special broadcast on [[TEN (TV station)|Channel 10]] \u2013 one episode (''in colour'').\n* ''Benny Hill's World Tour: New York!'' - 1991 special broadcast on the [[USA Network]] - one episode (''in colour'').<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0200476}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nuVkAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Benny+Hill's+World+Tour:+New+York!%22&dq=%22Benny+Hill's+World+Tour:+New+York!%22&hl=en&ei=xIOxTMaYL4TFswbfuum3DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ|title = Contemporary theatre, film, and ... - Google Books|publisher = books.google.co.uk|date = 20 May 2008|accessdate = 10 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Other programmes featuring Benny Hill==\n* ''Hi There!'', broadcast on BBC1 (1951).

The show consisted mainly of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] that were full of [[slapstick]], [[mime]], [[parody]] and [[double entendre]]. \n\nAt its peak ''The Benny Hill Show'' was among the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#United Kingdom|most-watched programmes]] in the UK with the audience reaching more than 21 million viewers in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html |title=Features &#124; Britain's Most Watched TV &#124; 1970s |publisher=British Film Institute (BFI) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122221511/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html |archive-date=22 November 2005 |access-date=22 October 2016}}</ref> [[Thames Television]] cancelled production of the show in 1989 due to declining ratings and large production costs at \u00a3450,000 ({{Inflation|UK|450,000|1989|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) per show. In a 2015 UK poll the show\u2019s theme song was voted number 1 on the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] special ''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Sound of ITV \u2013 The Nation's Favourite Theme Tune]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week38/sound-itv-nations-favourite-theme-tune|title=The Sound of ITV: The Nation\u2019s Favourite Theme Tunes Episode 1|publisher=itv.com|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Show format==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n''The Benny Hill Show'' features Benny Hill in various short comedy sketches and occasional, extravagant musical performances by artists of the time. Hill appears in many different costumes and portrays a vast array of characters. [[Slapstick]], [[burlesque]] and [[double entendre]]s are his hallmarks. A group of critics accused the show of [[sexism]], and Hill responded by claiming that female characters kept their dignity while the men who chase them were portrayed as [[buffoon]]s.\n\nThe show often uses [[undercranking]] and [[sight gag]]s to create what Hill called \"live animation\", and he employs comedic techniques such as mime and parody. The show typically closes with a sped-up chase scene involving Hill and often a crew of scantily clad women (usually with Hill being the one chased, due to silly predicaments that he himself caused), a send-up on the stereotypical [[Keystone Cops]] chase scenes. Hill also composed and sang [[patter song]]s and often entertained his audience with lengthy high-speed double-entendre rhymes and songs, which he recited or sang in a single take.\n\nHill also used the television camera to create comedic illusions. For example, in a murder mystery farce entitled \"Murder on the Oregon Express\" from 1976 (a parody of ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''), Hill used editing, camera angles and impersonations to depict a [[Quinn Martin]]\u2013like TV \"mystery\" featuring Hill in the roles of 1970s American television detectives ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', plus [[Hercule Poirot]].\n\nDuring his television career, Hill performed impersonations or parodies of such American celebrities as [[W. C. Fields]], [[Orson Welles]] (renamed \"Orson Buggy\"), [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Raymond Burr]], and fictional characters that range from ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'' to ''[[The A-Team]]'' (parodied as \"The B-Team\", in which he played the roles of both 'Hannibal' and 'B.A.') and ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]''. He also impersonated such international celebrities as [[Nana Mouskouri]] and [[Miriam Makeba]] as well as British stars such as [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Michael Caine]] (in his ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' role), newscasters [[Reginald Bosanquet]], [[Alan Whicker]] and [[Cliff Michelmore]], pop-music show hosts [[Jimmy Savile]] and [[Tony Blackburn]], musician [[Roger Whittaker]], his former 1960s record producer [[Tony Hatch]], political figures [[Robert Boothby, Baron Boothby|Lord Boothby]] and [[Denis Healey]] and Irish comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]]. On a few occasions, Hill even impersonated his former straight man, [[Nicholas Parsons]]. A spoof of ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' saw him playing both [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].\n\n==Production notes==\nThe show's closing theme tune, \"[[Yakety Sax]]\", which has gained a following in its own right, was written by James Q. \"Spider\" Rich and [[Boots Randolph]]. As the closing credits rolled, the theme was usually accompanied by a sped-up chase-sequence, often featuring scantily clad young women. The show's musical director was pianist and easy listening conductor [[Ronnie Aldrich]], and vocal backing was provided by [[Session musician|session singers]] [[the Ladybirds]] (who also frequently appeared on camera from 1969 to 1974). The saxophone soloist on Aldrich's version of \"Yakety Sax\" was Peter Hughes. For three episodes of the 1973\u20131974 season, [[Albert Elms]] filled in for Aldrich as musical director. \"Yakety Sax\" first appeared in the 19 November 1969 episode, which was also the first show for Thames.\n\nAnother signature of the show was the enthusiastic announcer intro: \"Yes! It's ''The Benny Hill Show!''\" (The announcer was often cast member [[Henry McGee]].) From 1975 forward, Hill was also introduced at the start of each show as \"The Lad Himself\". The show closed with Hill's salute: \"Thank you for being with us, and we look forward to seeing you all again\u2014very, very soon. Until then, bye bye.\".\n\n==Cast==\nThe main supporting cast includes [[Henry McGee]], Jon Jon Keefe, [[Nicholas Parsons]], [[Bob Todd]] and [[Jackie Wright]].\n\nThe regular sexpot-type females include [[Jenny Lee-Wright]], [[Sue Bond]], [[Bettina Le Beau]], [[Lesley Goldie]], [[Cherri Gilham]] and [[Diana Darvey]]. In later years, the show included a dance troupe, the Hill's Angels, which was briefly preceded by the Love Machine. Regular Angels were [[Sue Upton]] and [[Louise English]], whilst [[Jane Leeves]] also appeared as a Hill's Angel in a few episodes in the early 1980s; among those who appeared only once were Susan Clark and [[Sue McIntosh]].\n\nThe female singing group [[The Ladybirds]], featuring the bespectacled Maggie Stredder, were regulars on the show as background singers to Hill, and occasionally singing numbers on their own.\n\nCharacter actresses include [[Anna Dawson]], [[Bella Emberg]], [[Rita Webb]] and [[Patricia Hayes]].\n\n===Guest stars===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Don Estelle]]\n* [[Paul Eddington]]\n* [[Paula Wilcox]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Patrick Newell]]\n* [[Hugh Paddick]]\n* [[Kathy Staff]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Trisha Noble]]\n* [[Dilys Watling]]\n* [[Stella Moray]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Percy Thrower]]\n* [[Liz Fraser]]\n* [[Carl Wayne]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\nOccasionally, Hill would briefly chat with his guests on stage.  In the 1980s, as the climate of [[political correctness]] continued to grow, Eddington and Wilcox refused to allow the episodes in which they appeared to be shown on British television again.\n\n===Musical guest stars===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Petula Clark]]\n* [[Alma Cogan]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Kiki Dee]]\n* [[Judith Durham]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Cleo Laine]]\n* [[Mike Sammes|The Mike Sammes Singers]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]]\n* [[The Springfields]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Design (UK band)|Design]]\n* [[Sylvia McNeill]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\nHill also gave the first major exposure to some non-UK-based musical groups, including [[Luis Alberto del Paran\u00e1]] and [[Los Paraguayos]]. With few exceptions, most of the musical numbers did not make it to the U.S. syndicated series.\n\n==International airings==\nIn the late 1970s, Thames Television purchased a week of transmission time on two stations owned by [[RKO General]] that were offering a \"Thames Week\" schedule and were in the two largest American television markets: [[New York City]]'s [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV|KHJ-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]. This introduced the show to American audiences and became immediately popular; subsequent screenings involved a series of re-edited half-hour programmes culled from the [[ITV Network|ITV]] specials. As a result of heavy editing for fear of [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] licence revocation, the early US versions of the show have far less risqu\u00e9 material than those broadcast in the UK, though some brief female nudity and subtle sexual innuendo was apparently acceptable.\n\nThe show was awarded the 'Special Prize of the City of Montreux' at the [[Rose d'Or]] festival in 1984. Selected sketches from the first four years (1969\u20131972) of the Thames run were also edited into a feature film, ''[[The Best of Benny Hill]]'' (1974).\n\nIn 1977, Hill produced a special in [[Australia]] ''(see below)'' that provided material for some scattered episodes of the U.S. half-hour syndicated edits. The cast of that Australian show included [[Barry Otto]] and [[Ron Shand]].\n\nThe programme also aired on [[GBC TV]] in the British Overseas territory of [[Gibraltar]].\n\nIn Spain, the programme was inmensely popular in the early 1980s. With the arrival of the commercial stations, [[Telecinco]], in its first guise, depended heavily on old programming, and ''The Benny Hill Show'' would usually air for 60\u201390 minutes every night before the 20:30 news programme.\n\n===Repeats===\n''The Benny Hill Show'' aired in one-hour portions (not corresponding to the original hour-long format), twice nightly on [[BBC America]] from October 2004 to April 2007, restoring much of the mature content not seen in previous American airings (as such, most airings had a [[TV Parental Guidelines|rating]] of TV-MA){{cn|date=February 2018}} but also excising most of the musical segments. Half-hour edits also appeared on ITV.\n\nAs of July 2014, the show is being broadcast on [[Australia]]'s [[7Two]]. The show has also been aired in [[India]] on [[UTV (India)|UTV]], dubbed in various Indian languages.\n\n[[Antenna TV]], a network created for [[digital subchannels]] in the [[United States]], started showing the show Friday and Saturday nights in three hour blocks on New Year's Day, 1 January 2011. This version, while generally following the half-hour syndicated format, included many of the musical numbers.\n\nAs of 2017, the show is currently being broadcast on Makedonia TV (M.tv) in Greece.\n\n==Cancellation==\nIn June 1989, Thames Television's Head of Light Entertainment since March 1988, [[John Howard Davies]], invited Hill in for a meeting. Having just returned from a triumphant [[Cannes]] TV festival, Hill assumed that they were to discuss details of a new series. Instead, Davies informed Hill that his programme would discontinue production, and that he was dismissing Hill himself. In an episode about Hill from the documentary series ''Living Famously'', Davies stated there were three reasons why he did so: \"the audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired.\" All of which was untrue.\n\nAt its peak in 1977, 21.10 million viewers watched Hill's show. In 1989, the last Thames episode attracted 9.58 million viewers. However, this reason for the cancellation has been disputed{{who|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

Inside a principal value integral, we can treat <math>1/u</math> as a [[generalized function]] or distribution, and use the Fourier representation\n\n:<math> {1 \\over u} = \\int_0^\\infty dk \\, \\sin ku = \\int_0^\\infty dk \\, \\operatorname{Im} e^{iku} </math>\n\nWith <math>1/u=1/(y-x)</math>, we use the exponential representation of <math>\\sin(ku)</math> and complete the square with respect to <math>x</math> to find\n\n:<math> \\pi H(y) = \\operatorname{Im} \\int_0^\\infty dk \\,\\exp[-k^2/4+iky] \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, \\exp[-(x+ik/2)^2] </math>\n\nWe can shift the integral over <math>x</math> to the real axis, and it gives <math>\\pi^{1/2}</math>.
