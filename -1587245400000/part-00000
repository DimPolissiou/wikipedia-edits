His father worked in a shipping company by day and as a translator by night, along with two other jobs that he had.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite news|title=Albert Ho Chun-yan|work=HK Magazine|url=http://hk-magazine.com/article/inside-hk/interviews/3941/albert-ho-chun-yan|first=Jan|last=Leung}}</ref> Ho got his [[Bachelor of Laws]] with honors in the [[University of Hong Kong]] in 1974, obtained [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] in 1975.<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite web|title=Albert Ho Chun-yan|url=http://www.martinlee.org.hk/BiosAlbertHo.html}}</ref>\n\nHe attended lectures given by Hsu Kwan-san, a Chinese historian who later became a professor at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], whom Ho cited his political belief and Chinese national sentiment were influenced by. During his college life, he developed his liberal ideals and actively involved in student politics and campaigned for [[Mak Hoi-wah]] who ran for the [[Hong Kong University Students' Union]] against the Maoist nationalists who dominated the student union in the 1970s.\n\n==Legal and early political career==\nHo got [[admission to practice law]] in 1977 and appointed a [[notary public]] of the common law in 1988. He was employed for Messrs. C.Y. Kwan & Co. as a solicitor for nearly 20 years, then left to set up his own law firm, Ho, Tse, Wai & Partners. His [[litigation]] experience varied from banking cases and commercial law to land law and matrimonial disputes, as well as in criminal and medical negligence cases. Albert Ho worked a number of human rights cases on a [[pro bono]] (undertaken voluntarily and without payment) for the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]].<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nHo stepped into politics when he was first appointed to the [[Kowloon City District Council|Kowloon City District Board]] from 1982 to 1983.<ref name=\"Martin\"/> In 1985 he co-founded the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] (HKAS) to participate in the electoral politics during the transition period. During his spell as the leader of the HKAS, he demanded the faster pace of democratisation in Hong Kong and safeguarding the freedom and lifestyles after the handover of Hong Kong to Mainland China after 1997. In 1989, he co-founded the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] to support the [[Tiananmen protests of 1989]] and critical of the Beijing government's bloody crackdown. He became the third chairman of the alliance since 2014, succeeding [[Lee Cheuk-yan]].\n\nHe ran for the [[Urban Council of Hong Kong|Urban Council]] in Kowloon City West in the [[1986 Hong Kong municipal elections|1986 municipal election]] but was defeated by incumbent [[Peter Chan Chi-kwan]]. He ran again in the [[1991 Hong Kong municipal elections|1991 Urban Council election]] in [[Southern District, Hong Kong|Southern District]] but was again lost to incumbent Joseph Chan Yuet-sut of the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]]. He was elected to the [[Regional Council of Hong Kong|Regional Council]] in the [[1995 Hong Kong municipal elections|municipal elections]] in 1995, receiving the largest number of votes in Regional Council.<ref name=\"Martin\"/> He kept served on the council through 1997 until it was abolished by then [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] in 2000.\n\nHe had also been member of the [[Tuen Mun District Council]] for [[Lok Tsui (constituency)|Lok Tsui]] since the [[1999 Hong Kong local elections|1999 District Council election]]. He had been targeted by the radical democrats, including [[Albert Chan]] of the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] in the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council election]] who opposed Democrats' compromise with the Beijing officials on the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2012 constitutional reform proposals]] and in the [[2015 Hong Kong local elections|2015 District Council election]] by [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Cheng Chung-tai]]. He kept the seat for 15 years but was defeated in 2015 by [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] lawyer [[Junius Ho]] in 2015 by a narrow margin of 277 votes.\n\n==Legislative Councillor==\nIn April 1990, Ho and other pro-democracy activists co-founded the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK), the first major pro-democracy party in the city, in which he became the founding vice chairman. The party transformed into today's [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] in 1994 where he was the member of the party's first executive committee. In 1992, he ran for the [[1992 New Territories West by-election|by-election]] in [[New Territories West (constituency)#1991 Constituencies|New Territories West]] as his first attempt to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] after incumbent Democrat [[Ng Ming-yam]] died of cancer.

He ran again in New Territories West in [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 Legislative Council election]], receiving 54 percent of the popular vote.\n\nHe stepped down from the colonial legislature on 30 June 1997 on the eve of the [[handover of Hong Kong]] after the Beijing government dismantled the \"through train\" agreement of allowing the 1995 elected legislature to transition beyond 1997. The Democratic Party boycotted the [[Provisional Legislative Council]] controlled by Beijing and refused to take part in it. In November 1997, Ho was nominated by the Democratic Party to run for a seat in the [[National People's Congress]], but excluded from competition when failed to obtain the minimum number of nominations from the 400-strong Beijing-appointed election conference.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nIn the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council election]] of the SAR period in 1998, Ho won a seat in the New Territories West with his party colleague [[Lee Wing-tat]]. With his strong basis in his strategic district [[Tuen Mun]], he was re-elected in 2000 with one of the three Democratic Party tickets. [[Albert Chan]] who had strong basis in [[Tsuen Wan]] was also elected on the expense of Lee Wing-tat. Ho was re-elected in 2004.

He became the third chairman of the alliance since 2014, succeeding [[Lee Cheuk-yan]].\n\nHe ran for the [[Urban Council of Hong Kong|Urban Council]] in Kowloon City West in the [[1986 Hong Kong municipal elections|1986 municipal election]] but was defeated by incumbent [[Peter Chan Chi-kwan]].

This success, along with his 24\u20130 record, set up a match with the long-reigning world champion Klitschko in Germany, which Fury [[Wladimir Klitschko vs. Tyson Fury|won by unanimous decision]].\n\nFury was stripped of his IBF title 10 days after the Klitschko bout as he was unable to grant a fight with the IBF's [[mandatory challenger]], [[Vyacheslav Glazkov]], due to a rematch clause in his contract with Klitschko. The rematch did not materialise as Fury suffered from mental health issues leading to alcoholism, recreational drug use and extreme weight gain. He was charged with anti-doping violations. In 2016, he vacated the WBA, WBO, and IBO titles; ''The Ring'' stripped him of his last remaining title in early 2018. Later that year, after more than two years of inactivity, Fury challenged for the WBC heavyweight title against Wilder.

I just didn't care. I don't want to live anymore. So cocaine is a little minor thing compared to not wanting to live anymore. I am seeing help, but they can't do nothing for me. What I've got is incurable. I don't want to live. All the money in the world, fame and glory, means nothing if you're not happy. I'm seeing psychiatrists. They say I've got a version of [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]]. I'm a manic depressive. I don't even want to wake up. I hope I die every day.

And if I could take me own life \u2013 and I wasn't a Christian \u2013 I'd take it in a second. I just hope someone kills me before I kill me self. I'll have to spend eternity in hell.

Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round 1 as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round 4, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round 6, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round 7, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round 8 saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round 9, Wilder finally dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss\u2019 count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round 9, Wilder looked fatigued in round 10. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round 11, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round 12, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-controversial-draw-results--134241|title=Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury Ends in Controversial Draw|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46416721|title=Wilder v Fury: Stunning draw in WBC world heavyweight title fight|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Boxing|access-date=2008-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11569434/tyson-fury-forced-to-settle-for-a-draw-with-deontay-wilder|title=Tyson Fury forced to settle for a draw with Deontay Wilder|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[CompuBox]] statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%).

He has held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine and [[lineal championship|lineal]] titles since defeating [[Deontay Wilder]] in February 2020; previously he held the [[unified champion|unified]] [[WBA (Super)]], [[IBF]], [[WBO]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]], ''The Ring'' and lineal titles after defeating [[Wladimir Klitschko]] in 2015. With his [[Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury II|defeat of Wilder]], Fury became the third heavyweight, after [[Floyd Patterson]] and [[Muhammad Ali]], to hold ''The Ring'' magazine title twice, and the first heavyweight in history to have held the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO, and ''The Ring'' magazine titles.

After winning the [[British Boxing Board of Control|English heavyweight title]] twice, he became the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] and [[Commonwealth Boxing Council|Commonwealth]] champion in 2011 by defeating the 14\u20130 [[Dereck Chisora]]. He then won the [[Boxing Union of Ireland|Irish]] and WBO Inter-Continental titles, before defeating Chisora again in a 2014 rematch for the [[European Boxing Union|European]] and WBO International heavyweight titles. This success, along with his 24\u20130 record, set up a match with the long-reigning world champion Klitschko in Germany, which Fury [[Wladimir Klitschko vs. Tyson Fury|won by unanimous decision]].\n\nFury was stripped of his IBF title 10 days after the Klitschko bout as he was unable to grant a fight with the IBF's [[mandatory challenger]], [[Vyacheslav Glazkov]], due to a rematch clause in his contract with Klitschko. The rematch did not materialise as Fury suffered from mental health issues leading to alcoholism, recreational drug use and extreme weight gain. He was charged with anti-doping violations.

I just didn't care. I don't want to live anymore. So cocaine is a little minor thing compared to not wanting to live anymore. I am seeing help, but they can't do nothing for me. What I've got is incurable. I don't want to live. All the money in the world, fame and glory, means nothing if you're not happy. I'm seeing psychiatrists. They say I've got a version of [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]]. I'm a manic depressive. I don't even want to wake up. I hope I die every day.

And if I could take me own life \u2013 and I wasn't a Christian \u2013 I'd take it in a second. I just hope someone kills me before I kill me self. I'll have to spend eternity in hell.

Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round 1 as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round 4, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round 6, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round 7, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round 8 saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round 9, Wilder finally dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss\u2019 count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round 9, Wilder looked fatigued in round 10. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round 11, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round 12, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-controversial-draw-results--134241|title=Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury Ends in Controversial Draw|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46416721|title=Wilder v Fury: Stunning draw in WBC world heavyweight title fight|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Boxing|access-date=2008-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11569434/tyson-fury-forced-to-settle-for-a-draw-with-deontay-wilder|title=Tyson Fury forced to settle for a draw with Deontay Wilder|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[CompuBox]] statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%).

A further 1,100 houses were built after the Second World War. Since the Second World War, a reference has often been made by the local community, to the 'pre-war estate' of Southmead and the 'post-war estate', with locals also referring to them as \"The old estate\" and \"The new estate\".\n[[File:Tilling Road - geograph.org.uk - 255288.jpg|right|thumb|Southmead housing developments|281x281px]]\n==Southmead today==\n[[File:A pedestrian entrance to Southmead Hospital, Bristol (geograph 3314481).jpg|thumb|right|Pedestrian entrance to Southmead Hospital|277x277px]]\nThe centre of Southmead is along Greystoke Avenue, a wide road with grassy areas some distance to the North of the original hamlet on Southmead Road. The area to the South and West, falls within Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze ward since the last boundary review and further to the May 2016 elections. Parts of Southmead to the south-east of Southmead Road, including the hospital, are in Horfield ward.<ref>Southmead Ward Map https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/34844/Southmead+Ward+May+2016/28a2356c-7ab4-4911-a706-bd5ad897852c. Publisher=Bristol City Council. Year=2016. Accessed 12 February 2017</ref> \n==Social issues==\nEfforts have been made to improve the area's social problems and implement environmental improvements, many of which have been successful. Social policies have led to a more mixed housing offer and to some extent gentrification, with improved infrastructure and local services. The right to buy has led to an increased transfer of housing provision from tenanted to owner-occupation. Major employment hubs at Filton, MOD Abbey Wood and the increase of services at Southmead Hospital have brought increased affluence and opportunity to the area. A greater selection of shops and facilities have come to the area, allowing those on limited incomes to access food more cheaply and readily. Whilst Southmead as an area looks and feels as though it is improving, it still experiences deprivation. The central part of Southmead still sits within the most 10% deprived areas of England, and the South West of the Ward since 2015 now falls within the bottom 10-20% most deprived areas.<ref>https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32951/Deprivation+in+Bristol+2015/429b2004-eeff-44c5-8044-9e7dcd002faf. 'Deprivation in Bristol 2015'. Bristol City Council. Accessed 12 February 2017</ref> Ongoing social policies and economic impacts are taking time to incrementally improve the area.\n\nResidents have good geographical access.<ref>See Map 15, which show that Southmead does not fall under low geographical barriers indices - https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32951/Deprivation+in+Bristol+2015/429b2004-eeff-44c5-8044-9e7dcd002faf. 'Deprivation in Bristol 2015'. Bristol City Council. Accessed 12 February 2017</ref> There has however been a transfer of public services away from physical resources to more central, virtual and internet based services. For example, the Southmead Police Station is due to close, with a more regional hub at Patchway. Council tenant services are to be reduced at Southmead House off Greystoke Avenue. Bus services, whilst sometimes locally critiqued, are accessible and more frequent as compared to some other areas of the City. A frequent service connects residents to the Gloucester Road area, City Centre and Cribbs Causeway for shopping. The nearest station is however 2\u20133 miles away at Filton Abbey Wood.\n[[File:Glencoyne Square - Southmead - geograph.org.uk - 5921.jpg|thumb|Glencoyne Square|276x276px]]\nThere is provision of health services with a doctor's surgery on Ullswater Road and a modern new facility at the Greenway Centre. A regional hospital, and A&E facility can be found at Southmead Hospital. The Lannercost provides facilities for those with physical and learning impairments. There are a selection of care homes and sheltered accommodation about the ward area. Despite access to health facilities Southmead still has poor health outcomes; with life expectancy at 77 years, some 5 yrs lower than neighbouring Henleaze but not quite as bad as some areas such as the Bedminster at 76.4 years.<ref>See http://ias.bristol.gov.uk/IAS/dataviews/tabular?viewId=708&geoId=590&subsetId=.

There is a private member's sports club at David Lloyd near Badock's Wood. There are sports pitches at Greenway Centre to the South East, and at Charlton Mead to the East of the area. Filton Golf Course abuts Southmead to the North East. There is an MUGA and Adventure Playground off Doncaster Road. There are also play areas off of Glencoyne Square, Charlton Mead and off Greystoke Avenue. To the South of Southmead, only a mile away, is Horfield Sports Centre with public access to 3G pitches, gym, sports Hall and a swimming pool.<ref>See Southmead Community Plan for overview of community facilities. http://www.southmeadcommunityplan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Southmead-Com-Buildings-July-Final-Report.pdf.

Baddocks Wood Children Centre complements Early Year's provision to the South of the area. Young people are however said to be more socially deprived and not as likely to go to university as others in the country which is reflective of the national socio-economic imbalances within the UK's education system.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/03/university-access-social-exclusion | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Universities don't like common people, do they? | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd | date=3 February 2009 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Social cohesion==\nSouthmead has historically had adverse press due to community safety and cohesion.

The manor house, mentioned in a document of 1319, was near the south end of what is now Southmead Road.<ref>''The Henleaze Book'', p.14</ref> Most of the estate of {{convert|313|acre|km2}} was sold in the late 19th century. By 1888 Southmead was a small hamlet on Southmead Road.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's where community spirit thrives|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/s-community-spirit-thrives/story-16528444-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=13 July 2012}}</ref> [[Southmead Hospital]], formerly the Barton Regis Workhouse, was opened there in 1924.\n\nLarge-scale development of the area started in 1931, when the Bristol Corporation built 1,500 houses to the north of Southmead Road, partly to house families cleared from the [[slum]]s of central Bristol, and partly to address the housing shortage at the time. A further 1,100 houses were built after the Second World War. Since then, reference{{by whom|date=April 2020}} has often been made to the 'pre-war estate' of Southmead and the 'post-war estate', with locals referring to them as \"The old estate\" and \"The new estate\".{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Tilling Road - geograph.org.uk - 255288.jpg|right|thumb|Southmead housing developments]]\n==Southmead today==\n[[File:A pedestrian entrance to Southmead Hospital, Bristol (geograph 3314481).jpg|thumb|right|Pedestrian entrance to Southmead Hospital]]\nThe centre of Southmead is along Greystoke Avenue, a wide road with grassy areas some distance to the North of the original hamlet on Southmead Road. The area to the South and West, falls within Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze ward since the last boundary review and further to the May 2016 elections. Parts of Southmead to the south-east of Southmead Road, including the hospital, are in Horfield ward.<ref>Southmead Ward Map https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/34844/Southmead+Ward+May+2016/28a2356c-7ab4-4911-a706-bd5ad897852c. Publisher=Bristol City Council. Year=2016. Accessed 12 February 2017</ref> \n==Social issues==\nEfforts have been made to improve the area's social problems and implement environmental improvements, many of which have been successful. Social policies have led to a more mixed housing offer and to some extent gentrification, with improved infrastructure and local services. The right to buy has led to an increased transfer of housing provision from tenanted to owner-occupation. Major employment hubs at Filton, MOD Abbey Wood and the increase of services at Southmead Hospital have brought increased affluence and opportunity to the area. A greater selection of shops and facilities have come to the area, allowing those on limited incomes to access food more cheaply and readily. Whilst Southmead as an area looks and feels as though it is improving, it still experiences deprivation. The central part of Southmead still sits within the most 10% deprived areas of England, and the South West of the Ward since 2015 now falls within the bottom 10-20% most deprived areas.<ref>https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32951/Deprivation+in+Bristol+2015/429b2004-eeff-44c5-8044-9e7dcd002faf. 'Deprivation in Bristol 2015'. Bristol City Council. Accessed 12 February 2017</ref> Ongoing social policies and economic impacts are taking time to incrementally improve the area.\n\nResidents have good geographical access.<ref>See Map 15, which show that Southmead does not fall under low geographical barriers indices - https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32951/Deprivation+in+Bristol+2015/429b2004-eeff-44c5-8044-9e7dcd002faf. 'Deprivation in Bristol 2015'. Bristol City Council. Accessed 12 February 2017</ref> There has however been a transfer of public services away from physical resources to more central, virtual and internet based services. For example, the Southmead Police Station is due to close, with a more regional hub at Patchway. Council tenant services are to be reduced at Southmead House off Greystoke Avenue. Bus services, whilst sometimes locally critiqued, are accessible and more frequent as compared to some other areas of the City. A frequent service connects residents to the Gloucester Road area, City Centre and Cribbs Causeway for shopping. The nearest station is however 2\u20133 miles away at Filton Abbey Wood.\n[[File:Glencoyne Square - Southmead - geograph.org.uk - 5921.jpg|thumb|Glencoyne Square]]\nThere is provision of health services with a doctor's surgery on Ullswater Road and a modern new facility at the Greenway Centre. A regional hospital, and A&E facility can be found at Southmead Hospital. The Lannercost provides facilities for those with physical and learning impairments. There are a selection of care homes and sheltered accommodation about the ward area. Despite access to health facilities Southmead still has poor health outcomes; with life expectancy at 77 years, some 5 yrs lower than neighbouring Henleaze but not quite as bad as some areas such as the Bedminster at 76.4 years.<ref>See http://ias.bristol.gov.uk/IAS/dataviews/tabular?viewId=708&geoId=590&subsetId=.

There is a private member's sports club at David Lloyd near Badock's Wood. There are sports pitches at Greenway Centre to the South East, and at Charlton Mead to the East of the area. Filton Golf Course abuts Southmead to the North East. There is an MUGA and Adventure Playground off Doncaster Road. There are also play areas off of Glencoyne Square, Charlton Mead and off Greystoke Avenue. To the South of Southmead, only a mile away, is Horfield Sports Centre with public access to 3G pitches, gym, sports Hall and a swimming pool.<ref>See Southmead Community Plan for overview of community facilities. http://www.southmeadcommunityplan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Southmead-Com-Buildings-July-Final-Report.pdf.

Baddocks Wood Children Centre complements Early Year's provision to the South of the area. Young people are however said to be more socially deprived and not as likely to go to university as others in the country which is reflective of the national socio-economic imbalances within the UK's education system.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/03/university-access-social-exclusion | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Universities don't like common people, do they? | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd | date=3 February 2009 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Social cohesion==\n[[File:Southmead youth centre.jpg|right|thumb|Southmead Youth Centre]]\nSouthmead has historically had adverse press due to community safety and cohesion.

Decades later, TCFTV folded the operations of TV production companies it has acquired: [[Metromedia|Metromedia Producers Corporation]] in 1986, [[New World Pictures|New World Entertainment]] in 1997, and [[MTM Enterprises]] in 1998, and is the current distributor (via its distribution division, [[20th Television]]) for most of the shows originally produced by these companies.\n\nFrom 1986-2019, 20th Century Fox Television served as the Fox [[television network]]'s official production arm (with [[Fox 21 Television Studios|Fox Television Studios]] being viewed as the network's unofficial television production division), producing the bulk of [[television series]] airing on the [[television network]]. TCFTV produced the first two series that aired on Fox's sister network, [[MyNetworkTV]]: the telenovelas ''[[Desire (TV series)|Desire]]'' and ''[[Fashion House]]''.\n\nIn 1989, 20th Century Fox Television's functions were taken over by Twentieth Television Corporation, a separate entity from 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. Both companies were subsidiaries of News Corporation unit Fox Inc.; the move was made to separate the television productions from the movie studio in order to increase the latter's output.<ref name=ap-20thtelevision>{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title=20th Century Fox Restructures Film, Television Units|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/20th-Century-Fox-Restructures-Film-Television-Units/id-c84852dbf431b84aa16465a1c851bdb3|accessdate=December 27, 2012|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 12, 1989}}</ref> Following a 1994 restructuring of Fox's television production companies, 20th Television was refocused on syndication and \"non-traditional programs\", while network television programming once more came under the 20th Century Fox Television banner and returned to being a division of the movie studio.<ref name=lat-tcftvrestored>{{cite news|title=2 Named to Executive Posts in Fox TV Restructuring|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-05/business/fi-5172_1_twentieth-century-fox-television|accessdate=December 27, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 5, 1994}}</ref> In 1997, [[MTM Enterprises]] became part of 20th Century Fox Television, and thus remains an in-name only division of TCFTV.

This resulted in an album of the same name being released on Epic Records in 1977.

Vincent's personality meshed well with [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]], thus enabling him to play lead guitar on six of the nine tracks on the ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' album as well as co-writing three. After a disappointing Creatures of the Night/Tenth Anniversary tour, that finished on a high at what ended up being the \"last\" makeup show (and Kiss' largest crowd attendance) at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, Vincent returned to the studio with Kiss to record the ''[[Lick It Up]]'' album. His work was productive, yielding eight co-writes out of the ten songs on the album (a record for any member until [[Bruce Kulick]]'s nine on ''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions|Carnival of Souls]]'' and Stanley's ten on ''[[Monster (Kiss album)|Monster]]'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThough contributing to ''Creatures of the Night'' as a session player before being named as Frehley's replacement in December 1982, Vincent, for all the public knew, was the official guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar tracks on ''Lick it Up''. In what was a frequent occurrence for former guitarist Frehley, a \"ghost player\" was asked to play on the album, with [[Rick Derringer]] recording the solo on the opening track.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Exciter with Vincent solo.ogg|thumb|\"Exciter\" by Kiss with Vinnie Vincent solo.| right]]\n\nThough the band seemed to have renewed vigor on stage, all was not well. Vincent's refusal to sign the employment contract strained the relationship with Simmons/Stanley. Due partly to disputes over what his role in the band was and his pay would be (some reports indicated that Vincent had asked for, and was flatly denied, a percentage of the band's gross profits), and despite the exhortations of both Simmons and Stanley, all through his tenure with the band Vincent refused to sign any contract, making his employment unofficial. This ultimately led to Vincent leaving the band after the North American leg of the \"Lick It Up\" tour.<ref name=\"DS 1997\">Black Diamond: The Unauthorized Biography of KISS | Dale Sherman | 1997</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Lick It Up Tour]] ended in March 1984, Vincent was terminated from the band, and replaced by [[Mark St. John]].<ref name=\"DS 1997\"/> Despite parting on bad terms, Vincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'', contributing to the songs \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\", \"Heart Of Chrome\" and \"I Just Wanna\". Vincent again fell out of favor with Simmons and Stanley, as they claimed that Vincent again began \"making all kinds of crazy demands and pulling the same kind of crazy stuff all over again\".<ref name=\"DS 1997\"/>\n\n===Vinnie Vincent Invasion===\nFollowing his departure from Kiss in mid-1984, Vincent used his money that he made from his tenure in the band to take a long vacation and traveled the world for a full year visiting places like [[Tahiti]], [[Philippines]], [[Mozambique]], [[India]] and [[European Union|Europe]], including a visit to the small town [[Mora Municipality, Sweden|Mora]] in [[Dalarna]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"forumbilder\">{{cite web|url=http://forumbilder.se/images/8317200911401762e1.jpg|title=Image: 8317200911401762e1.jpg, (570 \u00d7 784 px)|publisher=forumbilder.se|accessdate=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219074453/http://forumbilder.se/images/8317200911401762e1.jpg|archive-date=December 19, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Then he formed the band [[Vinnie Vincent Invasion]] with, among others, former [[Journey (band)|Journey]] singer [[Robert Fleischman]] in the mid-1980s and released two studio albums: ''[[Vinnie Vincent Invasion (album)|Vinnie Vincent Invasion]]'' in 1986 and ''[[All Systems Go (Vinnie Vincent Invasion album)|All Systems Go]]'' in 1988. The band broke up in 1989.

Vincent, as well as playing all the guitars, played bass and did the drum programming under the guise of \"V. Meister\". Andre LaBelle provided drum tracks to the CD but they were replaced by Vincent's drum programming. LaBelle can be heard on various tracks on the bootleg Guitarmaggedon/Guitars from Hell CD that featured five more songs than the ''Euphoria'' EP.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nA tribute album entitled ''[[Kiss My Ankh|Kiss My Ankh: A Tribute To Vinnie Vincent]]'' was released by SplitScreen Entertainment on August 27, 2008.

He is a former member of the rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] from 1982 until mid-1984 during the band's transition out of their 1973\u20131983 makeup period. Vincent was the last member to wear a unique makeup/costume configuration, as the character of '''The Ankh Warrior''' (a design created by [[Paul Stanley]]), until he and the band were first shown without the makeup during an interview on MTV in September 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/23139/greatest-replacement-guitarists-in-rock/|title=Ranking Rock\u2019s 10 Greatest Replacement Guitarists|publisher=VH1.com|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> He also was the leader of his own band, [[Vinnie Vincent Invasion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=30126|title=Central High School Biography of Vinnie Vincent|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/vinnie-vincent/|title=Vinnie Vincent:Biography|publisher=MSN.Com|accessdate=November 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220445/http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/vinnie-vincent/|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nVincent John Cusano was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the son of Theresa \"Terri\" (Ferraro) and Alfonso Cusano, musicians.

This resulted in an album of the same name being released on Epic Records in 1977. It was recorded in New York City at Sound Ideas recording studios <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Treasure-Treasure/release/3332637 |title=Treasure \u2013 Treasure (Vinyl, LP, Album) {{!}} Discogs |access-date=April 20, 2017}}</ref>  In 1980, Vincent moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] where he became a staff songwriter for the television series ''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]''. Many of the series songs were written on Vincent's [[acoustic guitar]] while sitting at the Cunninghams' kitchen table on the ''Happy Days'' set, during off-time from the show's rehearsal schedule.

Vincent's personality meshed well with [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]], thus enabling him to play lead guitar on six of the nine tracks on the ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' album as well as co-writing three. After a disappointing Creatures of the Night/Tenth Anniversary tour, that finished on a high at what ended up being the \"last\" makeup show (and Kiss' largest crowd attendance) at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, Vincent returned to the studio with Kiss to record the ''[[Lick It Up]]'' album. His work was productive, yielding eight co-writes out of the ten songs on the album (a record for any member until [[Bruce Kulick]]'s nine on ''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions|Carnival of Souls]]'' and Stanley's ten on ''[[Monster (Kiss album)|Monster]]'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThough contributing to ''Creatures of the Night'' as a session player before being named as Frehley's replacement in December 1982, Vincent, for all the public knew, was the official guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar tracks on ''Lick it Up''. In what was a frequent occurrence for former guitarist Frehley, a \"ghost player\" was asked to play on the album, with [[Rick Derringer]] recording the solo on the opening track.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Exciter with Vincent solo.ogg|thumb|\"Exciter\" by Kiss with Vinnie Vincent solo.| right]]\n\nThough the band seemed to have renewed vigor on stage, all was not well. Vincent's refusal to sign the employment contract strained the relationship with Simmons/Stanley. Due partly to disputes over what his role in the band was and his pay would be (some reports indicated that Vincent had asked for, and was flatly denied, a percentage of the band's gross profits), and despite the exhortations of both Simmons and Stanley, all through his tenure with the band Vincent refused to sign any contract, making his employment unofficial. This ultimately led to Vincent leaving the band after the North American leg of the \"Lick It Up\" tour.<ref name=\"DS 1997\">Black Diamond: The Unauthorized Biography of KISS | Dale Sherman | 1997</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Lick It Up Tour]] ended in March 1984, Vincent was terminated from the band, and replaced by [[Mark St. John]].<ref name=\"DS 1997\"/> Despite parting on bad terms, Vincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'', contributing to the songs \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\", \"Heart Of Chrome\" and \"I Just Wanna\". Vincent again fell out of favor with Simmons and Stanley, as they claimed that Vincent again began \"making all kinds of crazy demands and pulling the same kind of crazy stuff all over again\".<ref name=\"DS 1997\"/>\n\n===Vinnie Vincent Invasion===\nFollowing his departure from Kiss in mid-1984, Vincent used his money that he made from his tenure in the band to take a long vacation and traveled the world for a full year visiting places like [[Tahiti]], [[Philippines]], [[Mozambique]], [[India]] and [[European Union|Europe]], including a visit to the small town [[Mora Municipality, Sweden|Mora]] in [[Dalarna]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"forumbilder\">{{cite web|url=http://forumbilder.se/images/8317200911401762e1.jpg|title=Image: 8317200911401762e1.jpg, (570 \u00d7 784 px)|publisher=forumbilder.se|accessdate=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219074453/http://forumbilder.se/images/8317200911401762e1.jpg|archive-date=December 19, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Then he formed the band [[Vinnie Vincent Invasion]] with, among others, former [[Journey (band)|Journey]] singer [[Robert Fleischman]] in the mid-1980s and released two studio albums: ''[[Vinnie Vincent Invasion (album)|Vinnie Vincent Invasion]]'' in 1986 and ''[[All Systems Go (Vinnie Vincent Invasion album)|All Systems Go]]'' in 1988. The band broke up in 1989. After that, the band's singer [[Mark Slaughter]] and bassist [[Dana Strum]] formed [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1996, Vincent released a solo EP from the studio sessions he did in 1990 (some say 1989\u201391), called ''[[Euphoria (Vinnie Vincent album)|Euphoria]]'', once again with [[Robert Fleischman]] on vocals. Vincent, as well as playing all the guitars, played bass and did the drum programming under the guise of \"V. Meister\". Andre LaBelle provided drum tracks to the CD but they were replaced by Vincent's drum programming. LaBelle can be heard on various tracks on the bootleg Guitarmaggedon/Guitars from Hell CD that featured five more songs than the ''Euphoria'' EP.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nA tribute album entitled ''[[Kiss My Ankh|Kiss My Ankh: A Tribute To Vinnie Vincent]]'' was released by SplitScreen Entertainment on August 27, 2008.

The Perla brothers were small-time gamblers who saw the [[1978\u201379 Boston College Eagles men's basketball team|1978\u201379 Boston College basketball season]] as a perfect opportunity to earn a lot of money. They wanted to recruit Rick Kuhn to join the scheme. Kuhn, a high school friend of Rocco Perla, was entering his senior year at Boston College and was expected to be a key member of the 1978\u201379 Eagles basketball team.\n\nThe Perla brothers proposed a simple scheme. They along with Kuhn would select certain basketball games where the projected [[point spread]] separating Boston College from its opponent was expected to be significant. Kuhn would be responsible for ensuring, by his play on the court, that Boston College fell short of the point spread. Thus, for example, if participating bookmakers determined Boston College to be an eight-point favorite in a particular game, Kuhn would be paid a bonus, usually $2,500, if Boston College won by less than eight points.

Kuhn agreed to participate, and brought in his teammate [[Jim Sweeney (basketball)|Jim Sweeney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/03/15/key-figures-point-shaving-scandal/Rq4jWh7Fe926ez07XjtUKN/story.html?p1=Article_Related_Box_Article |title=Key figures in the BC point shaving scandal |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=March 15, 2014 |accessdate=October 17, 2017 |author=Globe Staff}}</ref>\n\n==Setup==\nRocco and Tony Perla then mobilized a betting syndicate to maximize their potential gain from this operation. They contacted a local friend, Paul Mazzei, who was known to have influence within major New York gambling circles. Mazzei in turn contacted [[Henry Hill]], a [[Lucchese crime family]] associate from New York who had befriended Mazzei while both men were serving sentences in a federal prison. Mazzei and the Perlas were particularly hopeful that Hill would enlist the support of his associate, [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] (\"Jimmy the Gent\"), to  finance the payments to the players and to set up a network of [[bookmaker]]s who were in on the scheme. These bookies could handle large bets and [[Lay off (bookmaking)|lay them off]] and spread the bets among a number of unsuspecting bookmakers around the country so as not to arouse suspicion. They would also ensure protection for the enterprise in the event that the unsuspecting bookmakers, all of whom had toughs at their disposal to collect unpaid debts, discovered they were being swindled. Hill and Burke were brought into the scheme, after receiving approval from Lucchese crime family capo [[Paul Vario]].\n\nBurke, through Hill, would front the money to pay the players, forwarding the money to Pittsburgh to Paul Mazzei as the go-between, who would forward it to the Perla brothers who would pass it to the players directly. The same channels would be used for the passing of the point spread from Burke and Hill to the players.\n\nBurke had Hill fly to Boston on November 16, 1978, to meet with Mazzei, Tony Perla, Kuhn, and any other member of the Boston College team interested in participating in their scheme. Said Hill, \"I asked the players which of the upcoming games they felt we could shave. Sweeney took out one of those little schedule cards, circled the games he thought we could fool around with, and gave the card to me. They kept saying that they liked the idea of just shaving points and not blowing the games.\" However, as noted below, the scheme also worked in games where the Eagles were expected to lose anyway, with them shaving points so that the syndicate could bet on the other team winning by more than the point spread. After discussing their strategy with Kuhn and Sweeney, it was agreed that the upcoming Providence game would be an appropriate test for their scheme.\n\n==Point fixing==\n\nThe [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]] game was played on December 6, 1978, and [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] was favored to win by six to seven points. Kuhn was thus expected to keep the score below the six- to seven-point margin. The test run for the scheme proved unsuccessful, when [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College's]] team established an early lead and ultimately won the game by 19 points.\n\nEnraged by their gambling loss, the conspiring Perla Brothers, Mazzei, Burke, and Hill decided to recruit additional [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] players to enhance their control over the outcome of the games. They had Kuhn approach Ernie Cobb, the leading scorer on the team, but it has never been proven if Cobb agreed to cooperate. Burke instructed Hill to warn the players to keep to their end of the deal because \"you can't play basketball with broken hands.\"\n\nThe December 16 game against [[Harvard Crimson men's basketball|Harvard]] was chosen as the second test for the scheme.  [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] was favored by 12 to 13 points, but won the game by only a three-point margin, 86\u201383. The syndicate was very happy with this result, and Kuhn was given cash to distribute to the players for their efforts.\n\nThe scheme continued to work successfully in the December 23 game against [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. In this game, the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|Bruins]] were favored to win over the [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Eagles]] by a 15 to 18-point spread, so the syndicate bet on the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|Bruins]] to win by a margin greater than the point spread.  The [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Eagles]] managed to lose by 22 points, 103\u201381, with the syndicate winning its bet.\n\nSuspecting that some bookmakers might be getting wise to the scheme, the conspirators temporarily revised their strategy after the UCLA game. To allay any suspicions of foul play, they decided to bet on [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] to win by more than the point spread (\"cover the spread\") in a game that they were confident [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] would win handily. The conspirators chose the January 17 game against [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] to implement this plan. Their strategy was effective: [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]], a five-point favorite, covered the spread with a 90\u201380 win over [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Uconn]] .\n\nIn early February, [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] was scheduled to play two [[New York (state)|New York]] teams, [[Fordham Rams|Fordham]] and [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]]. The conspirators decided that these games presented especially good opportunities because [[New York (state)|New York]] bookmakers generally accepted large bets for [[New York (state)|New York]] teams. They reintroduced the original strategy and it proved successful for the February 3 [[Fordham Rams|Fordham]] game when [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]], a 10-point favorite, won by seven points, 71\u201364.\n\nThe February 6 game against [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] was a \"push\" (get your exact bet back), as the syndicate neither won nor lost when [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] prevailed 85\u201376, the exact point spread (9) the bookmakers had offered.{{Efn-lr|name=9\u201312|The syndicate was able to lay 9 points when the game was first available to be bet, and therefore pushed. Bookmakers, on seeing the heavy action, moved the line as high as 12 to discourage bets on the favorite [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|(St. John's)]] and attract more bets on the underdog. Those later betters on [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] lost money because they laid more than the eventual 9 point margin of victory.}}\n\nConfident from their recent success, the conspirators viewed the February 10 game against [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] as an opportunity to reap the full benefits of their scheme. They were aware that bookmakers generally accepted large bets on this game because [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] and [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] were traditional rivals and also because the game was being nationally televised. [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] was favored to win and, consistent with the scheme, the conspirators bet on [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] to win by a margin greater than the point spread, 7.{{Efn-lr|name=2\u20137|In this case, while the line may have opened, or at one time gone to, 2, because of the heavy betting on [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]], the syndicate had to lay as many as 7 points, and therefore lost their bet.}} [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] ultimately won by only two points, 98\u201396, as Ernie Cobb scored eight points in the final minute to bring [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]] close, and everyone involved lost a substantial amount of money. Hill stated that, at the time, he and Burke were watching the game on television at Burke's home in [[Howard Beach, Queens]], and when it was over Burke, having lost $50,000 (${{Inflation|US|50000|1979|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) of his own money on the game, put his foot through his television set in a rage. Said Hill, \"He wanted me to fly up to Boston. Ultimately, nothing happened. Jimmy said he was finished. He didn't want to be bothered with these kids anymore.\" The scheme thus ended on an unsuccessful note.\n\nThe [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College basketball team]] ended its 1978\u201379 season with a 22\u20139 record. It is unclear how much money the players involved in the point-shaving scheme were paid. Hill reportedly cleared over $100,000  (${{Inflation|US|100000|1979|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) and bettors higher up the line were said to have made up to $250,000 (${{Inflation|US|250000|1979|r=-2|fmt=c}} today).\n\n==Uncovering of the scheme==\nThe Boston College basketball point-shaving conspiracy was uncovered in 1980 when Hill was arrested and indicted by [[New York (state)|New York state]] authorities on [[drug trafficking]] charges and subsequently was implicated in the [[Lufthansa heist]], which occurred while the basketball scheme was underway (December 1978). Hill [[Turn state's evidence|turned state's evidence]] in exchange for avoiding prison time and to escape possible execution by Burke and the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese family]]. While being questioned on the drug and heist crimes, Hill inadvertently revealed that he had recently participated in a point-shaving scheme involving the Boston College basketball team and various underworld figures. Hill offered to relate the full story of the swindle if federal officials would guarantee him full immunity and would agree to intercede on his behalf to convince state officials to drop the drug charges pending in state court.\n\nThe grand jury indicted Burke, Mazzei, Kuhn, Rocco Perla, and Tony Perla on the basis of testimony given by Hill.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Hill was listed as a co-conspirator, but was not named as a defendant. At the trial in 1981, the government's case consisted primarily of the testimony of Hill and three other witnesses, James Sweeney and Joseph Beaulieu, both Boston College players, and Barbara Reed, a 23-year-old nurse who lived with Kuhn during the 1978\u201379 Boston College season. The government also introduced two confessions, one made by Kuhn and the other by Tony Perla.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Finally, the government presented telephone records showing evidence of extensive communications between the conspirators during the 1978\u201379 season and records provided by Western Union and various hotels which further corroborated government testimony.\n\nAfter a four-week trial, each conspirator was convicted on charges of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) conspiracy, conspiracy to commit sports bribery, and interstate travel with the intent to commit bribery. Burke was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.<ref>{{cite news|title=James (Jimmy the Gent) Burke, Gangster, 64, of 'Wiseguy' Fame|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/17/nyregion/james-jimmy-the-gent-burke-gangster-64-of-wiseguy-fame.html|accessdate=19 April 2018|agency=The New York Times|date=17 April 1996}}</ref> Kuhn was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1982/02/06/kuhn-gets-10-year-sentence-in-bc-point-shaving-case/6dd15e0e-48a8-4ce8-a8ad-a5154b210f21/|title=Kuhn Gets 10-Year Sentence In BC Point-Shaving Case|last=Barnes|first=Bart|date=1982-02-06|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> later reduced to 28 months.

In this game, the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|Bruins]] were favored to win over the [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Eagles]] by a 15 to 18-point spread, so the syndicate bet on the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|Bruins]] to win by a margin greater than the point spread.  The [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Eagles]] managed to lose by 22 points, 103\u201381, with the syndicate winning its bet.\n\nSuspecting that some bookmakers might be getting wise to the scheme, the conspirators temporarily revised their strategy after the UCLA game. To allay any suspicions of foul play, they decided to bet on [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] to win by more than the point spread (\"cover the spread\") in a game that they were confident [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] would win handily. The conspirators chose the January 17 game against [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] to implement this plan. Their strategy was effective: [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]], a five-point favorite, covered the spread with a 90\u201380 win over [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Uconn]] .\n\nIn early February, [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] was scheduled to play two [[New York (state)|New York]] teams, [[Fordham Rams|Fordham]] and [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]]. The conspirators decided that these games presented especially good opportunities because [[New York (state)|New York]] bookmakers generally accepted large bets for [[New York (state)|New York]] teams. They reintroduced the original strategy and it proved successful for the February 3 [[Fordham Rams|Fordham]] game when [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]], a 10-point favorite, won by seven points, 71\u201364.\n\nThe February 6 game against [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] was a \"push\" (get your exact bet back), as the syndicate neither won nor lost when [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] prevailed 85\u201376, the exact point spread (9) the bookmakers had offered.{{Efn-lr|name=9\u201312|The syndicate was able to lay 9 points when the game was first available to be bet, and therefore pushed. Bookmakers, on seeing the heavy action, moved the line as high as 12 to discourage bets on the favorite [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|(St. John's)]] and attract more bets on the underdog. Those later betters on [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] lost money because they laid more than the eventual 9 point margin of victory.}}\n\nConfident from their recent success, the conspirators viewed the February 10 game against [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] as an opportunity to reap the full benefits of their scheme. They were aware that bookmakers generally accepted large bets on this game because [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] and [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] were traditional rivals and also because the game was being nationally televised. [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] was favored to win and, consistent with the scheme, the conspirators bet on [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] to win by a margin greater than the point spread, 7.{{Efn-lr|name=2\u20137|In this case, while the line may have opened, or at one time gone to, 2, because of the heavy betting on [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]], the syndicate had to lay as many as 7 points, and therefore lost their bet.}} [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]] ultimately won by only two points, 98\u201396, as Ernie Cobb scored eight points in the final minute to bring [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]] close, and everyone involved lost a substantial amount of money. Hill stated that, at the time, he and Burke were watching the game on television at Burke's home in [[Howard Beach, Queens]], and when it was over Burke, having lost $50,000 (${{Inflation|US|50000|1979|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) of his own money on the game, put his foot through his television set in a rage. Said Hill, \"He wanted me to fly up to Boston. Ultimately, nothing happened. Jimmy said he was finished. He didn't want to be bothered with these kids anymore.\" The scheme thus ended on an unsuccessful note.\n\nThe [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College basketball team]] ended its 1978\u201379 season with a 22\u20139 record. It is unclear how much money the players involved in the point-shaving scheme were paid. Hill reportedly cleared over $100,000  (${{Inflation|US|100000|1979|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) and bettors higher up the line were said to have made up to $250,000 (${{Inflation|US|250000|1979|r=-2|fmt=c}} today).\n\n==Uncovering of the scheme==\nThe Boston College basketball point-shaving conspiracy was uncovered in 1980 when Hill was arrested and indicted by [[New York (state)|New York state]] authorities on [[drug trafficking]] charges and subsequently was implicated in the [[Lufthansa heist]], which occurred while the basketball scheme was underway (December 1978). Hill [[Turn state's evidence|turned state's evidence]] in exchange for avoiding prison time and to escape possible execution by Burke and the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese family]]. While being questioned on the drug and heist crimes, Hill inadvertently revealed that he had recently participated in a point-shaving scheme involving the Boston College basketball team and various underworld figures. Hill offered to relate the full story of the swindle if federal officials would guarantee him full immunity and would agree to intercede on his behalf to convince state officials to drop the drug charges pending in state court.\n\nThe grand jury indicted Burke, Mazzei, Kuhn, Rocco Perla, and Tony Perla on the basis of testimony given by Hill.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Hill was listed as a co-conspirator, but was not named as a defendant. At the trial in 1981, the government's case consisted primarily of the testimony of Hill and three other witnesses, James Sweeney and Joseph Beaulieu, both Boston College players, and Barbara Reed, a 23-year-old nurse who lived with Kuhn during the 1978\u201379 Boston College season. The government also introduced two confessions, one made by Kuhn and the other by Tony Perla.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Finally, the government presented telephone records showing evidence of extensive communications between the conspirators during the 1978\u201379 season and records provided by Western Union and various hotels which further corroborated government testimony.\n\nAfter a four-week trial, each conspirator was convicted on charges of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) conspiracy, conspiracy to commit sports bribery, and interstate travel with the intent to commit bribery. Burke was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.<ref>{{cite news|title=James (Jimmy the Gent) Burke, Gangster, 64, of 'Wiseguy' Fame|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/17/nyregion/james-jimmy-the-gent-burke-gangster-64-of-wiseguy-fame.html|accessdate=19 April 2018|agency=The New York Times|date=17 April 1996}}</ref> Kuhn was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1982/02/06/kuhn-gets-10-year-sentence-in-bc-point-shaving-case/6dd15e0e-48a8-4ce8-a8ad-a5154b210f21/|title=Kuhn Gets 10-Year Sentence In BC Point-Shaving Case|last=Barnes|first=Bart|date=1982-02-06|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> later reduced to 28 months.
