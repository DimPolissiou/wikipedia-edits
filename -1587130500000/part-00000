It is located at the corner of [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]] and Union Street in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], serving the communities of [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]] and [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times. The [[D (New York City Subway service)|D]] and [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] trains also stop here during late nights, and a few rush-hour [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Union Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970. The station was also renovated in 1970 and in the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line.

It is located at the corner of [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]] and Union Street in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], serving the communities of [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]] and [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times. The [[D (New York City Subway service)|D]] and [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] trains also stop here during late nights, and a few rush-hour [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Union Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970. The station was also renovated in 1970 and in the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line.

It is located at Prospect Avenue and Fourth Avenue near the convergence of the [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]], [[Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn|Greenwood Heights]], [[Park Slope]], and [[South Park Slope]] neighborhoods. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times. The [[D (New York City Subway service)|D]] and [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] trains also stop here during late nights, and a few rush-hour [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Prospect Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Prospect Avenue started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970.

station|station]] on the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] in [[Brooklyn]]. It is located at Prospect Avenue and Fourth Avenue near the convergence of the [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]], [[Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn|Greenwood Heights]], [[Park Slope]], and [[South Park Slope]] neighborhoods. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times. The [[D (New York City Subway service)|D]] and [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] trains also stop here during late nights, and a few rush-hour [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Prospect Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Prospect Avenue started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970. The station was also renovated in 1970 and 2017.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Prospect Av station before renewal (38060731396).jpg|thumb|left|The station prior to renovation]]\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe Prospect Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line.
