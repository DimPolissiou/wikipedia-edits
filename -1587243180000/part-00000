Headquartered in [[Greenlawn, New York|Greenlawn]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], since 1955, it had facilities in several other locations in Long Island, including its Wheeler Laboratories facility in [[Smithtown, New York]], manufacturing plants in [[Riverhead (town), New York|Riverhead]] and Little Neck, NY, and a division in [[Braintree, Massachusetts]].  \n\nThe company originally concentrated on the design of electronic circuits and the licensing of patents. Innovations in radio, monochrome and later color television components allowed the company to grow. One particularly lucrative design was the [[Automatic Gain Control]] circuit. This was such a useful feature that almost every AM radio made used this feature, by license from Hazeltine, from about 1930 until the patent expired. Hazeltine Corporation also developed and licensed many of the basic concepts of the [[NTSC]] color television system.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1959 the president of the Hazeltine Company was [[Philip La Follette]], former three-term governor of Wisconsin and son of \"Fighting Bob\" La Follette, who campaigned for president in 1924 as the Progressive Party candidate.\n\nThe company flourished into the 1980s as a United States Federal [[defense contractor]] with particular success as a designer and manufacturer of \"[[Identification Friend or Foe]]\" (IFF) military detection and identification systems.  \n\nDuring the 1970s, as an outgrowth of its defense work, Hazeltine Corp. developed the [[Hazeltine Terminal]],<ref>\n[http://vt100.net/hazeltine/h1500-rm.pdf \"Hazeltine H1500 Video Display Terminal Reference Manual\"], Hazeltine Corporation, July 1977</ref> an early [[monochrome]] [[Computer terminal#\"Intelligent\" terminals|smart terminal]]. Several improved models followed, including the popular [[Hazeltine 1500]], which found use in the emerging [[microcomputer]] market in the late 1970s. The company eventually sold the terminal line to a short-lived third party called Esprit, which was managed by ex-Hazeltine employees.\n\nHazeltine was acquired by the [[Emerson Electric Company]] in 1986. \n\nIn 1990, Emerson demerged its Government and Defense Group (including Hazeltine) to form ESCO Electronics Corporation. \n\nIn 1996, Hazeltine was acquired from ESCO by [[Marconi Electronic Systems|GEC-Marconi Electronic Systems Corp.]], a US subsidiary of [[The General Electric Company plc|The General Electric Company]], and renamed '''GEC-Marconi Hazeltine'''. ESCO was represented by investment banking firm Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Inc. in a deal which valued Hazeltine at $110 million. \n\nWith the 1999 merger of GEC-Marconi and [[British Aerospace]] to form [[BAE Systems]], GEC-Marconi Hazeltine was renamed '''BAE Systems Advanced Systems'''.  In 2002, it was renamed '''BAE Systems CNIR''' (Communication, Navigation, Identification and Reconnaissance). \n\nIn a 2007 reorganization, the division was folded into [[BAE Systems Electronics and Integrated Solutions]] and is currently known as '''BAE Systems Sensor Systems'''.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[ftp://ftp.cs.utk.edu/pub/shuford/terminal/hazeltine_news.txt Richard S.

Hazeltine Corporation also developed and licensed many of the basic concepts of the [[NTSC]] color television system.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1959 the president of the Hazeltine Company was [[Philip La Follette]], former three-term governor of Wisconsin and son of \"Fighting Bob\" La Follette, who campaigned for president in 1924 as the Progressive Party candidate.\n\nThe company flourished into the 1980s as a United States Federal [[defense contractor]] with particular success as a designer and manufacturer of \"[[Identification Friend or Foe]]\" (IFF) military detection and identification systems.  \n\nDuring the 1970s, as an outgrowth of its defense work, Hazeltine Corp. developed the [[Hazeltine Terminal]],<ref>\n[http://vt100.net/hazeltine/h1500-rm.pdf \"Hazeltine H1500 Video Display Terminal Reference Manual\"], Hazeltine Corporation, July 1977</ref> an early [[monochrome]] [[Computer terminal#\"Intelligent\" terminals|smart terminal]]. Several improved models followed, including the popular [[Hazeltine 1500]], which found use in the emerging [[microcomputer]] market in the late 1970s. The company eventually sold the terminal line to a short-lived third party called Esprit, which was managed by ex-Hazeltine employees.\n\nHazeltine was acquired by the [[Emerson Electric Company]] in 1986. \n\nIn 1990, Emerson demerged its Government and Defense Group (including Hazeltine) to form ESCO Electronics Corporation. \n\nIn 1996, Hazeltine was acquired from ESCO by [[Marconi Electronic Systems|GEC-Marconi Electronic Systems Corp.]], a US subsidiary of [[The General Electric Company plc|The General Electric Company]], and renamed '''GEC-Marconi Hazeltine'''. ESCO was represented by investment banking firm Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Inc. in a deal which valued Hazeltine at $110 million. \n\nWith the 1999 merger of GEC-Marconi and [[British Aerospace]] to form [[BAE Systems]], GEC-Marconi Hazeltine was renamed '''BAE Systems Advanced Systems'''.  In 2002, it was renamed '''BAE Systems CNIR''' (Communication, Navigation, Identification and Reconnaissance). \n\nIn a 2007 reorganization, the division was folded into [[BAE Systems Electronics and Integrated Solutions]] and is currently known as '''BAE Systems Sensor Systems'''.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[ftp://ftp.cs.utk.edu/pub/shuford/terminal/hazeltine_news.txt Richard S.

The Dukes were a charter member of the modern [[Northern League (baseball, 1993\u20132010)|Northern League]], which started play in 1993. The Dukes played their home games at [[Wade Stadium]]. After the 2002 season, the Dukes were moved to Kansas City where they were renamed the [[Kansas City T-Bones|T-Bones]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Duluth\u2013Superior Dukes were a re-incarnation of previous minor league teams based in the [[Twin Ports]]. The [[Duluth Dukes]] and [[Superior Blues]] both played in earlier versions of the [[Northern League (baseball, 1902\u201371)|Northern League]], with the two teams merging after the 1955 season. Initially the team was called the White Sox, with the team becoming the [[Duluth-Superior Dukes (1956\u201370)|Duluth-Superior Dukes]] in 1960. The team would fold after the 1970 season, with the league itself folding one year later.\n\nThe modern version of the Northern League was founded by Miles Wolf as a minor professional [[independent baseball league]]. This means the league was not affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]] or the [[Minor League Baseball|organized minor leagues]]. The Dukes became one of six original teams that began play in the 1993 season, along with the [[St. Paul Saints]], the [[Sioux Falls Canaries]], the [[Sioux City Explorers]], the [[Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks]] and the Rochester Aces (who moved after one season and become the [[Winnipeg Goldeyes]]). The team would play its home games at Wade Stadium, which had been the home to the previous versions of the Dukes/White Sox since it was completed in 1941. [[Mal Fichman]] was named the team's first manager.\n\n==Early struggles==\n\nThe league employed a [[split season]], with the winner of each half making the playoffs. This was done so that teams would have a chance to overcome a bad start and could remain in playoff contention later into the season. However, this system did not help the Dukes, as they were perennial cellar dwellers early on. For only one half during the first three seasons did the Dukes manage to avoid finishing in last place in the six team league (they finished fifth during the first half in 1995).\n\nDespite the struggles of the team, there were a couple of individual highlights. Catcher/outfielder [[Jeff Grotewold]], who was on the Dukes roster in 1994 and had played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1992, would return to the majors in 1995 with the Kansas City Royals.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/groteje02.shtml</ref> In 1995, catcher Pete Kuld (acquired in a mid-season trade with Thunder Bay) would go on to lead the league in home runs with 24.\n\nThe 1996 season saw changes for the league (it split into two divisions with four teams each) as well as a turn around for the team. With new manager [[George Mitterwald]], the Dukes would post a 21\u201321 record in the first half, a game and a half behind East Division winner St. Paul. The playoff race in the second half would go down to the final days of the season with the Dukes battling the [[Madison Black Wolf]] (who, along with the [[Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks]], joined the league as expansion teams for the 1996 season). Coming into the game with identical second half records, Madison would defeat the Dukes in the final game of the season to claim a playoff spot and end the Dukes season.\n\n==Championship season==\n\nWith Mitterwald returning as manager for the 1997 season, along with a number of players, the team was expected to contend. However, the team struggled in the first half and finished six and half games behind St. Paul, who finished first in the East Division. However, the Dukes were much improved in the second half of the season, finishing with a 22\u201320 record, their first winning half in team history. So despite an overall record below .500, the Dukes claimed a playoff berth by finishing first in the East Division for the second half. The team was powered by Mike Meggers (acquired in a mid-season trade with Winnipeg), who would lead the league with 32 home runs. The pitching staff was led by starter Jeremy McGarity and closer Emiliano Giron.\n\nIn the playoffs, they would meet St. Paul. The Dukes won the series 3 games to 2 to claim the Eastern Division title. They then moved on to face the Western Division winner, the Winnipeg Goldeyes. With the series tied at 2, the Dukes would win the deciding game 3\u20131 in front of a sold-out Wade Stadium to claim the league championship.<ref>http://attic.areavoices.com/2008/09/09/dukes-win-1997/</ref> The championship was especially rewarding for McGarity, infielders Al Barsoom and first baseman Jeff Jensen. Each were in their third season and had been a part of the struggles the team had been through previously.\n\nLeague championship series MVP Allen Halley, who was the winning pitcher in the deciding game against Winnipeg, died from a seizure in March 1998.<ref>http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Duluth-Superior-Dukes-Pitcher-Dies/id-4210d0e68ce311a95cb22c9ed3246fee</ref> It had been expected that Halley would have returned to the team for the 1998 season.\n\n==Ila Borders==\n\nHistory was made in the Northern League in 1997 when the St. Paul Saints signed [[Ila Borders]], who became one of the first women to pitch in men's professional baseball. After a few outings with the Saints, Borders was traded to the Dukes about a month into the season.<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-26/sports/sp-6980_1_ila-borders</ref> Borders would see limited action during that season, but she would be a member of the championship team. She returned to the Dukes for the 1998 season. After not pitching much in the first half of the season, Borders would become the first woman to start a men's professional baseball game on July 7, 1998.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/10/sports/plus-baseball-it-s-another-first-for-pitcher-borders.html</ref> On July 24, she recorded her first and only win of the season, another first for a woman. She again returned to the Dukes for the 1999 season, but the new manager decreased her playing time. She requested a trade, which was granted, with the Dukes sending her to the Madison Black Wolf.\n\n==Second playoff berth==\n\nThe 1998 and 1999 seasons saw a return to losing for the Dukes, as they missed out on the playoffs both seasons. However, the 2000 season saw a resurgence. Under new manager [[Benny Castillo]], the Dukes enjoyed one of their best seasons. The team just missed claiming the first half title in the East division, finishing one and half games behind St. Paul. This season, much like in 1996, would be a battle down the stretch between the Dukes and Madison. Finishing with identical second half records, the two teams would meet in a one-game playoff to determine who would make the playoffs. After losing to Madison in 1996, the Dukes would not let history repeat itself, as they beat the Black Wolf to claim their second ever playoff berth.\n\nFirst baseman Anthony \"Big Papa\" Lewis (in his third season with the team), designated hitter Tony Mitchell, and outfielder [[Jim Rushford]] powered the offense. They would lead the team with 33, 26, and 12 home runs respectively. The pitching staff was led by Chris Swaitkiewicz, who led the team with 11 wins.\n\nThe team went on a roll through the first two rounds of the playoffs, beating St. Paul (3 games to 1) to claim the Eastern Division title and Fargo-Moorhead (3 games to 0) to claim the Central Championship. However, due to the recent merger between the Northern League and the Northeast League the year before, there was an extra round of playoffs to be played. The Dukes would be swept by Adirondack 3 games to 0, ending their season.\n\nTwo players from this team would go on to make appearances in Major League Baseball. After the season, Rushford was signed to a contract by the Milwaukee Brewers organization and would go on to play 23 games with the Brewers at the end of the 2002 season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rushfji01.shtml</ref> Pitcher [[Terry Pearson (baseball)|Terry Pearson]] would sign with the Detroit Tigers organization and would pitch in four games during the 2002 season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pearste01.shtml</ref>\n\n==Final seasons==\n\nThe turn of the century brought numerous changes to the league, as teams left struggling markets and moved to more prosperous ones. After the 1998 season, Thunder Bay moved to the Chicago area and became the [[Schaumburg Flyers]], while the Black Wolf left Madison after the 2000 season and became the [[Lincoln Saltdogs]]. 2002 also saw further expansion into the Chicago market, with the addition of the [[Gary SouthShore RailCats]] and the [[Joliet JackHammers]].\n\nThese changes left the Dukes near the bottom of the league in attendance, with the team averaging a league low 1209 fans per game for the 2002 season.<ref>http://www.nlfan.com/league/results/results02.shtml</ref> Also, the team failed to build off the success of the 2000 season and struggled on the field in 2001 and 2002, especially in the second half. These factors combined led to rumors that owner John Ehlert would move the team. Despite assurances he would keep the team in Duluth, Ehlert announced in September 2002 that the team would re-locate and become the [[Kansas City T-Bones]].<ref>http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=1974807</ref>\n\nHowever, Wade Stadium and Duluth would not remain without a team for long. The [[Northwoods League]], a [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer baseball league]], immediately granted Duluth a team to fill the void left by the Dukes. This team would be called the [[Duluth Huskies]] and began play in the 2003 season.\n\n==Seasonal record==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Season !! Division !! W \u2013 L <br> (1st Half)!!

The playoff race in the second half would go down to the final days of the season with the Dukes battling the [[Madison Black Wolf]] (who, along with the [[Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks]], joined the league as expansion teams for the 1996 season). Coming into the game with identical second half records, Madison would defeat the Dukes in the final game of the season to claim a playoff spot and end the Dukes season.\n\n==Championship season==\n\nWith Mitterwald returning as manager for the 1997 season, along with a number of players, the team was expected to contend. However, the team struggled in the first half and finished six and half games behind St. Paul, who finished first in the East Division. However, the Dukes were much improved in the second half of the season, finishing with a 22\u201320 record, their first winning half in team history. So despite an overall record below .500, the Dukes claimed a playoff berth by finishing first in the East Division for the second half. The team was powered by Mike Meggers (acquired in a mid-season trade with Winnipeg), who would lead the league with 32 home runs. The pitching staff was led by starter Jeremy McGarity and closer Emiliano Giron.\n\nIn the playoffs, they would meet St. Paul. The Dukes won the series 3 games to 2 to claim the Eastern Division title. They then moved on to face the Western Division winner, the Winnipeg Goldeyes. With the series tied at 2, the Dukes would win the deciding game 3\u20131 in front of a sold-out Wade Stadium to claim the league championship.<ref>http://attic.areavoices.com/2008/09/09/dukes-win-1997/</ref> The championship was especially rewarding for McGarity, infielders Al Barsoom and first baseman Jeff Jensen. Each were in their third season and had been a part of the struggles the team had been through previously.\n\nLeague championship series MVP Allen Halley, who was the winning pitcher in the deciding game against Winnipeg, died from a seizure in March 1998.<ref>http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Duluth-Superior-Dukes-Pitcher-Dies/id-4210d0e68ce311a95cb22c9ed3246fee</ref> It had been expected that Halley would have returned to the team for the 1998 season.\n\n==Ila Borders==\n\nHistory was made in the Northern League in 1997 when the St. Paul Saints signed [[Ila Borders]], who became one of the first women to pitch in men's professional baseball. After a few outings with the Saints, Borders was traded to the Dukes about a month into the season.<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-26/sports/sp-6980_1_ila-borders</ref> Borders would see limited action during that season, but she would be a member of the championship team. She returned to the Dukes for the 1998 season. After not pitching much in the first half of the season, Borders would become the first woman to start a men's professional baseball game on July 7, 1998.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/10/sports/plus-baseball-it-s-another-first-for-pitcher-borders.html</ref> On July 24, she recorded her first and only win of the season, another first for a woman. She again returned to the Dukes for the 1999 season, but the new manager decreased her playing time. She requested a trade, which was granted, with the Dukes sending her to the Madison Black Wolf.\n\n==Second playoff berth==\n\nThe 1998 and 1999 seasons saw a return to losing for the Dukes, as they missed out on the playoffs both seasons. However, the 2000 season saw a resurgence. Under new manager [[Benny Castillo]], the Dukes enjoyed one of their best seasons. The team just missed claiming the first half title in the East division, finishing one and half games behind St. Paul. This season, much like in 1996, would be a battle down the stretch between the Dukes and Madison. Finishing with identical second half records, the two teams would meet in a one-game playoff to determine who would make the playoffs. After losing to Madison in 1996, the Dukes would not let history repeat itself, as they beat the Black Wolf to claim their second ever playoff berth.\n\nFirst baseman Anthony \"Big Papa\" Lewis (in his third season with the team), designated hitter Tony Mitchell, and outfielder [[Jim Rushford]] powered the offense. They would lead the team with 33, 26, and 12 home runs respectively. The pitching staff was led by Chris Swaitkiewicz, who led the team with 11 wins.\n\nThe team went on a roll through the first two rounds of the playoffs, beating St. Paul (3 games to 1) to claim the Eastern Division title and Fargo-Moorhead (3 games to 0) to claim the Central Championship. However, due to the recent merger between the Northern League and the Northeast League the year before, there was an extra round of playoffs to be played. The Dukes would be swept by Adirondack 3 games to 0, ending their season.\n\nTwo players from this team would go on to make appearances in Major League Baseball. After the season, Rushford was signed to a contract by the Milwaukee Brewers organization and would go on to play 23 games with the Brewers at the end of the 2002 season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rushfji01.shtml</ref> Pitcher [[Terry Pearson]] would sign with the Detroit Tigers organization and would pitch in four games during the 2002 season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pearste01.shtml</ref>\n\n==Final seasons==\n\nThe turn of the century brought numerous changes to the league, as teams left struggling markets and moved to more prosperous ones. After the 1998 season, Thunder Bay moved to the Chicago area and became the [[Schaumburg Flyers]], while the Black Wolf left Madison after the 2000 season and became the [[Lincoln Saltdogs]]. 2002 also saw further expansion into the Chicago market, with the addition of the [[Gary SouthShore RailCats]] and the [[Joliet JackHammers]].\n\nThese changes left the Dukes near the bottom of the league in attendance, with the team averaging a league low 1209 fans per game for the 2002 season.<ref>http://www.nlfan.com/league/results/results02.shtml</ref> Also, the team failed to build off the success of the 2000 season and struggled on the field in 2001 and 2002, especially in the second half. These factors combined led to rumors that owner John Ehlert would move the team. Despite assurances he would keep the team in Duluth, Ehlert announced in September 2002 that the team would re-locate and become the [[Kansas City T-Bones]].<ref>http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=1974807</ref>\n\nHowever, Wade Stadium and Duluth would not remain without a team for long. The [[Northwoods League]], a [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer baseball league]], immediately granted Duluth a team to fill the void left by the Dukes. This team would be called the [[Duluth Huskies]] and began play in the 2003 season.\n\n==Seasonal record==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Season !! Division !! W \u2013 L <br> (1st Half)!!

It was established in February 1999 by five developers formerly of Rebel Boat Rocker. [[Randy Pitchford]], one of the founders, serves as [[President (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]]. Gearbox initially created expansions for the [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] game ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'', then ported that game and others to console platforms. In 2005, Gearbox launched its first independent set of games, ''[[Brothers in Arms (video game series)|Brothers in Arms]]'', on console and mobile devices. It became their flagship franchise and spun off a comic book series, television documentary, books, and action figures. Their second original game series, ''[[Borderlands (series)|Borderlands]]'', commenced in 2009, and by 2015 had sold over 26 million copies. The company also owns the intellectual property of ''[[Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Homeworld]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Gearbox Software logo (1999).jpg|thumb|left|The primary of two variations of Gearbox Software's original logo created by Brian Martel, Stephen Bahl and Landon Montgomery.

Porting ''Half-Life'' to console platforms (each with new game content) followed, building the company's experience in console game-making, in addition to enhancing and building upon the successful ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' branch of the ''Half-Life'' franchise. Prior to ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', they had developed or helped develop every ''Half-Life'' expansion game or port, including ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift|Blue Shift]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', ''Half-Life'' for the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] (including ''[[Half-Life: Decay]]''), and ''Half-Life'' for the Sega [[Dreamcast]] (including ''Blue Shift''). Branching out to other publishers, they pursued additional [[Porting|port]] work, each game being released with additional content, but this time from console to PC. These projects included their first non-first-person shooter, ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'', and ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', forging new publisher relationships with [[Activision]] and [[Microsoft Game Studios]] respectively. Additional new development, in the form of a PC game in the [[James Bond]] franchise (''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]'') for [[Electronic Arts]], also occurred during the company's initial 5-year period.\n\nIn 2005, they launched an original property of their creation, ''[[Brothers in Arms (series)|Brothers in Arms]]'', with the release of ''[[Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30]]'' on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Personal computer|PC]] and PlayStation 2.

Schreiber created a test map to give an idea of what it may look like, which he took screenshots of and posted on the Gearbox forums. Shortly after posting the screenshots the images and the project made their way to various gaming sites causing a small buzz within the gaming community. He first contacted Gearbox Software, who told him to contact [[George Broussard]] and Scott Miller at 3D Realms. Schreiber proceeded to contact 3D Realms. The screenshots for the project were enough to convince Scott Miller to a certain degree about the project, but the game would need Take Two's permission for it to happen.\n\nSchreiber again contacted Gearbox, hoping they would have a better relationship with Take Two than 3D Realms. After following the proper channels within Gearbox, he was able to get in contact with PJ Putnam, the company's vice-president and General Counsel. Gearbox was interested in helping the project and Schreiber was eventually granted a \"personal non-commercial license\" to Duke Nukem.\n\nHaving received permission to proceed, Schreiber announced the game on October 13, 2010, under the name ''Duke Nukem Next-Gen'', revealing he had set up a small team to work with. It was also stated the game would be based on the Unreal Engine 3 and would not require any other game for it to run. On November 4, 2010, the game was renamed to ''Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded''.\n\nThe game has been put on an indefinite hold as of September 24, 2011, pending the resolution of differences between the Interceptor Entertainment team and Gearbox Software due to ambiguity on whether or not the finished product would actually be allowed to see release.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schreiber |first=Frederik |title=Public Announcement |url=http://www.interceptor-entertainment.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2418 |work=Project Lead |publisher=Interceptor Entertainment |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203094845/http://www.interceptor-entertainment.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2418 |archivedate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Gearbox confirmed that a new ''Duke Nukem'' was in development and that concept images have been made.<ref>{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/head-turning-new-duke-nukem-game-teased-but-dont-e/1100-6428903/ |title=\"Head-Turning\" New Duke Nukem Game Teased, But Don't Expect it Soon |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=July 15, 2015 |accessdate=October 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009162730/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/head-turning-new-duke-nukem-game-teased-but-dont-e/1100-6428903/ |archivedate=October 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn September 4, 2016, Gearbox announced ''Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour''.

It was established in February 1999 by five developers formerly of Rebel Boat Rocker. [[Randy Pitchford]], one of the founders, serves as [[President (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]]. Gearbox initially created expansions for the [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] game ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'', then ported that game and others to console platforms. In 2005, Gearbox launched its first independent set of games, ''[[Brothers in Arms (video game series)|Brothers in Arms]]'', on console and mobile devices. It became their flagship franchise and spun off a comic book series, television documentary, books, and action figures. Their second original game series, ''[[Borderlands (series)|Borderlands]]'', commenced in 2009, and by 2015 had sold over 26 million copies. The company also owns the intellectual property of ''[[Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Homeworld]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Gearbox Software logo (1999).jpg|thumb|left|The primary of two variations of Gearbox Software's original logo created by Brian Martel, Stephen Bahl and Landon Montgomery.

Porting ''Half-Life'' to console platforms (each with new game content) followed, building the company's experience in console game-making, in addition to enhancing and building upon the successful ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' branch of the ''Half-Life'' franchise. Prior to ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', they had developed or helped develop every ''Half-Life'' expansion game or port, including ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift|Blue Shift]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', ''Half-Life'' for the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] (including ''[[Half-Life: Decay]]''), and ''Half-Life'' for the Sega [[Dreamcast]] (including ''Blue Shift''). Branching out to other publishers, they pursued additional [[Porting|port]] work, each game being released with additional content, but this time from console to PC. These projects included their first non-first-person shooter, ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'', and ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', forging new publisher relationships with [[Activision]] and [[Microsoft Game Studios]] respectively.

Schreiber created a test map to give an idea of what it may look like, which he took screenshots of and posted on the Gearbox forums. Shortly after posting the screenshots the images and the project made their way to various gaming sites causing a small buzz within the gaming community. He first contacted Gearbox Software, who told him to contact [[George Broussard]] and Scott Miller at 3D Realms. Schreiber proceeded to contact 3D Realms. The screenshots for the project were enough to convince Scott Miller to a certain degree about the project, but the game would need Take Two's permission for it to happen.\n\nSchreiber again contacted Gearbox, hoping they would have a better relationship with Take Two than 3D Realms. After following the proper channels within Gearbox, he was able to get in contact with PJ Putnam, the company's Vice-President and General Counsel. Gearbox was interested in helping the project and Schreiber was eventually granted a \"personal non-commercial license\" to Duke Nukem.\n\nHaving received permission to proceed, Schreiber announced the game on October 13, 2010, under the name ''Duke Nukem Next-Gen'', revealing he had set up a small team to work with. It was also stated the game would be based on the Unreal Engine 3 and would not require any other game for it to run. On November 4, 2010, the game was renamed to ''Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded''.\n\nThe game has been put on an indefinite hold as of September 24, 2011, pending the resolution of differences between the Interceptor Entertainment team and Gearbox Software due to ambiguity on whether or not the finished product would actually be allowed to see release.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schreiber |first=Frederik |title=Public Announcement |url=http://www.interceptor-entertainment.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2418 |work=Project Lead |publisher=Interceptor Entertainment |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203094845/http://www.interceptor-entertainment.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2418 |archivedate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Gearbox confirmed that a new ''Duke Nukem'' was in development and that concept images have been made.<ref>{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/head-turning-new-duke-nukem-game-teased-but-dont-e/1100-6428903/ |title=\"Head-Turning\" New Duke Nukem Game Teased, But Don't Expect it Soon |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=July 15, 2015 |accessdate=October 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009162730/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/head-turning-new-duke-nukem-game-teased-but-dont-e/1100-6428903/ |archivedate=October 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn September 4, 2016, Gearbox announced ''Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour''.

After three years of construction, the [[Alfa Romeo Arese Plant]] first began vehicle production in 1963, which would continue for decades, becoming the biggest production facility for Alfa Romeo. The factory became known simply as \"Arese\" as most of the industrial area and its main entrance are in this municipality. Following a gradual decrease in production activities, the factory finished manufacturing activities in 2005. Today the factory is almost totally closed and abandoned, since the Alfa Romeo owners ([[FIAT]]) have almost completely moved design and production to other factories inside and outside [[Italy]]. The few remaining employees (about 500) have often demonstrated against their dismissal.

After three years of construction, the [[Alfa Romeo Arese Plant]] first began vehicle production in 1963, which would continue for decades, becoming the biggest production facility for Alfa Romeo. The factory became known simply as \"Arese\" as most of the industrial area and its main entrance are in this municipality. Following a gradual decrease in production activities, the factory finished manufacturing activities in 2005. Today the factory is almost totally closed and abandoned, since the Alfa Romeo owners ([[FIAT]]) have almost completely moved design and production to other factories inside and outside [[Italy]]. The few remaining employees (about 500) have often demonstrated against their dismissal. At the moment, most of the factory buildings are abandoned and the local administrations are looking for projects to use the huge area in a proper way, given its location.
