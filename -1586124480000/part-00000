The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service.

The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit.

After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps.

After that he continued to devote himself to botanical study, and in 1817 he and [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] were sent to [[Brazil]] by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I Joseph]], the [[king of Bavaria]]. They travelled from [[Rio de Janeiro]] through several of the southern and eastern provinces of [[Brazil]] and travelled up the [[Amazon River]] to [[Tabatinga]], as well as exploring some of its larger tributaries.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn his return to [[Europe]] in 1820 Martius was appointed as the keeper of the botanic garden at [[Munich]], including the [[herbarium]] at the [[Botanische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen|Munich Botanical Collection]], and in 1826 as professor of botany in the university there, and he held both offices until 1864. He devoted his chief attention to the flora of Brazil, and in addition to numerous short papers he published the ''Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Brasiliensium'' (1823\u20131832, 3 vols.) and ''Icones selectae Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Brasiliensium'' (1827), both works being finely illustrated. An account of his travels in Brazil appeared in three volumes between 1823 and 1831, with an atlas of plates, but probably the work by which he is best known is his ''[[Historia naturalis palmarum]]'' (1823\u20131850) in three large folio volumes, in which all known genera of the palm family are described and illustrated. The work contains more than 240 [[chromolithographs]], with habitat sketches and botanical dissections.<ref>[http://sciweb.nybg.org/Science2/Onlinexhibits/exhbtcata.html Plants and Gardens Portrayed: Rare and Illustrated Books from The LuEsther T<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1840 he began the ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'', with the assistance of the most distinguished European botanists, who undertook monographs of the various orders. Its publication was continued after his death under the editorship of [[A. W. Eichler]] (1839\u20131887) until 1887, and subsequently of [[Ignatz Urban]]. He also edited several works on the zoological collections made in Brazil by Spix, after the death of the latter in 1826. In 1837, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn the outbreak of [[potato]] disease in Europe he investigated it and published his observations in 1842.

At the time of his death the collection had been further expanded and comprised 300,000 specimens representing 65,000 species from around the world, and was one of the largest private herbaria assembled.\n\nThe [[Belgium|Belgian government]] acquired the collection in 1870 which formed the basis of the then newly established ''Jardin botanique de l'Etat''.

The party left from [[Trieste]] on April 10, 1817.\n\nThe first natural history collections were made in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] at [[Laranjeiras]], [[Corcovado]], [[Aqueduto]], [[Fonte da Carioca]], [[Tijuca]], [[Botafogo]], [[Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, Rio de Janeiro|Jardim Botanico]]) immediately following the wedding.\n\nSpix and Martius then spent some days at \"Fazenda Mandioca\" with [[Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff]] and then went to a [[fazenda]] near [[Para\u00edba do Sul|Rio Paraiba]] before returning to Rio. A mounted expedition took them on horseback to [[Itagua\u00ed]] (December 13, 1817) through [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo state]] to the city of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] where they arrived on December 31, 1817. They left on January 9th, 1818 for [[Sorocaba]] and [[Itu, Brazil|Itu]] on to [[Minas Gerais]], then through [[Camanducaia]] to cross the [[Do Peixe River (Sapuca\u00ed River)|Rio Sapuca\u00ed]] for [[S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Par\u00e1|S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo]] and [[Ouro Pr\u00eato]]. On May 1, 1818, they left for [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], [[Minas Novas]] and then [[Montes Claros]].\n\n[[File:Martius and Spix route in Brazil 1817-1820.jpg|thumb|220px|Route followed by Martius and Spix between 1817 and 1820]]\nOn August 12, 1818, they headed North-North East to [[Carinhanha River|Rio Carinhanha]], as far as the [[Serra Geral]] then returned by [[Cod\u00f3]] to [[Carinhanha]] arriving at [[Rio de Contas]] on October 17, 1818, then riding east to cross the [[Paragua\u00e7u River|Rio Paragua\u00e7u]] arriving at [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] on the November 10th, 1818, and leaving on February 18th, 1819 via [[Alagoas|Coit]] and [[Jacobina]]. The party then travelled to [[Piaui]], [[Oeiras, Piau\u00ed|Oeiras]] where they arrived on May 3. They departed on May 11, arriving on May 15 at [[Cear\u00e1|S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante]], where Martius became seriously ill.

After that he continued to devote himself to botanical study, and in 1817 he and [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] were sent to [[Brazil]] by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I Joseph]], the [[king of Bavaria]]. They travelled from [[Rio de Janeiro]] through several of the southern and eastern provinces of [[Brazil]] and travelled up the [[Amazon River]] to [[Tabatinga]], as well as exploring some of its larger tributaries.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn his return to [[Europe]] in 1820 Martius was appointed as the keeper of the botanic garden at [[Munich]], including the [[herbarium]] at the [[Botanische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen|Munich Botanical Collection]], and in 1826 as professor of botany in the university there, and he held both offices until 1864. He devoted his chief attention to the flora of Brazil, and in addition to numerous short papers he published the ''Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Brasiliensium'' (1823\u20131832, 3 vols.) and ''Icones selectae Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Brasiliensium'' (1827), both works being finely illustrated. An account of his travels in Brazil appeared in three volumes between 1823 and 1831, with an atlas of plates, but probably the work by which he is best known is his ''[[Historia naturalis palmarum]]'' (1823\u20131850) in three large folio volumes, in which all known genera of the palm family are described and illustrated. The work contains more than 240 [[chromolithographs]], with habitat sketches and botanical dissections.<ref>[http://sciweb.nybg.org/Science2/Onlinexhibits/exhbtcata.html Plants and Gardens Portrayed: Rare and Illustrated Books from The LuEsther T<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1840 he began the ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'', with the assistance of the most distinguished European botanists, who undertook monographs of the various orders. Its publication was continued after his death under the editorship of [[A. W. Eichler]] (1839\u20131887) until 1887, and subsequently of [[Ignatz Urban]]. He also edited several works on the zoological collections made in Brazil by Spix, after the death of the latter in 1826.

At the time of his death the collection had been further expanded and comprised 300,000 specimens representing 65,000 species from around the world, and was one of the largest private herbaria assembled.\n\nThe [[Belgium|Belgian government]] acquired the collection in 1870 which formed the basis of the then newly established ''Jardin botanique de l'Etat''.

For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.<ref name=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health\">{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}</ref> Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period. According surveys commissioned by to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] between 20%\u201330% of teenagers used/abused illicit substances, a much higher rate than single-mother households.<ref name=\"Youth Substance Abuse, NIDA\">{{cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/drug-abuse-statistics/|title=Drug Abuse Statistics, NIDA|date=1997\u20132014}}</ref> Another example of poorly cited statistics to further this narrative can be found in children who have lost at least one parent. In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%\u201350%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M. Amabile states, \"Those kinds of events can crush a child, they can lead to a lot of problems; they can lead to substance abuse, they can lead to various forms of emotional illness. They can also lead to incredible resilience and almost superhuman behaviors, seemingly, if people can come through those experiences intact.

However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\n\nData from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/|title=The gun's not in the closet|date=Aug 2018}}</ref> The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting. This has led many to question whether parents should be held criminally negligent for their children's gun-related crimes. By 2018, a total of four parents were convicted of failing to lock up the guns that were used to shoot up US schools by their children.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\"/> Such incidents may also lead to nationwide discussion on gun laws.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government Vows to Take Action Following Kauhajoki Shootings |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/govt_promises_action_following_kauhajoki_shootings/6112199 |accessdate=September 23, 2008 |work=YLE}}</ref>\n\nThe [[FBI]] offer a guide for helping to identify potential school shooters, ''The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective''.<ref name=\"The School Shooter, 1999\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/stats-services-publications-school-shooter-school-shooter/view|title=The School Shooter|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n'''\"Student 'Rules the Roost'\"'''\n\"The parents set few or no limits on the child's conduct, and regularly give in to his demands. The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children.\"\n\n'''\"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet\"'''\n\"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal of time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects.\"\n\nThis last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.\n \n[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}</ref> Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents. No more than they could come from attentive, educated, negligent, single, married, abusive, or loving parents.\n\n===Younger age===\nAccording to [[Adrian Raine|Raine]] (2002), [[Developmental age|immaturity]] is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of [[violence]] and outbursts of [[aggression]].<ref>Raine, A (2002) \u2013 [https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_13840000000000001/attachments/280145/Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Issue%25202%252D%2520Criminal%2520Behavior%2520Biological.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJFNFXH2V2O7RPCAA%2F20180220%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20180220T005116Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=23f428ae1771a265c3e52655a7f89c172460554591678d83000da681f239993e Biological Basis for Crime in Crime: Public Policies for Crime control (J.Q.

While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the [[nervous system]] in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, [[axons]], [[neurons]], and [[synapses]], to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. ''pruning'' (or [[apoptosis]], otherwise known as ''cell death'').<ref>Feinberg, Irwin \u2013 [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-synaptic-pruning-important-for-the-developing-brain/ Why synaptic pruning is important for the developing brain] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref> These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the [[pre-frontal cortex]], the brain location where [[decision-making]] occurs, is the concluding area for development. While the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on the brain part known as the [[amygdala]]; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including [[aggression]] and [[impulsiveness]]. As a consequence each individual is more likely to want to make riskier choices, and to do so more frequently.<ref>Raising children network, in collaboration with, the Centre for Adolescent Health \u2013 [http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/brain_development_teenagers.html Brain development: Teenagers] ''Australian parenting website'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref>\n \nSteinberg (2004)<ref>Steinberg, L (2004) \u2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15251873 Risk taking in adolescence: what changes, and why?] [[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] Accessed February 20, 2018</ref> identified the fact of adolescents ''taking more risks'', typically, than adults; Deakin et al.

One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|title=Mass Shootings and Mental Health Policy|journal=Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=107\u2013121}}</ref>\n\nIt is also mentionable that school size can play a role on the presence of shooter mental health concerns. In a presented study from researchers Baird, Roellke & Zeifman from the Social Science Journal, it is presented that school size and level of attention given to students can precede violent actions, as students who commit mass shootings in larger schools are likely to have transitioned from smaller schools. This adds important nuance to the idea that larger schools are more prone to mass violence by showing that the stress associated with losing the personal support given in a smaller community is a weight on students. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baird, Roellke, & Zeifman |title=Alone and adrift: The association between mass school shootings, school size, and student support |journal=Social Science Journal |date=2017 |issue=54 |pages=261-270 |doi=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009 |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nA 2016 opinion piece concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not.

In several peer\u2010reviewed articles on mental health consequences of school shootings by Lowe & Galea, it is shown that mass shootings can bring on the onset of PTSD and continued depression. In the cities that are home to these kind of events, the town can experience continued paranoia and an exaggerated sense of fear. Lowe & Galea continue to say that continued research is necessary to pinpoint the exact mental symptoms that occur in the victims of school shootings.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Draucker |first1=Claire-Burke |title=The mental health consequences of mass school shootings: What do we need to know? |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |year=2020 |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=423\u2013425 |publisher=Wiley |doi=10.1111/jan.14258 |pmid=31713890}}</ref>\n\n=== Violent video games theory ===\nIt has long been debated whether there exists a correlation between school shooting perpetrators and the type of media they consume. A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\n\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\n\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 & Spencer, 2009). Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.\n\n==Frequency trends==\nSchool shootings are a \"modern phenomenon\". There were scattered instances of gunmen or bombers attacking schools in the years before the [[Frontier Middle School shooting]] in [[Moses Lake, Washington]] in 1996, \"but they were lower profile\", according to journalist [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in 2015.<ref name=nyr20151019/> Beginning in the late 1990s, there has been a steep increase in the frequency of school shootings across the globe.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertz|first1=Frank|title=Deadly Dreams|journal=Scientific American Mind|volume=18|issue=4|pages=52\u201359|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0807-52|year=2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In the United States specifically, the most recent trend has been downward following the spikes of the 1990s, yet at the same time they are trending towards a higher likelihood of being premeditated and executed with a strict plan in mind.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertz|first1=Frank|title=Deadly Dreams|journal=Scientific American Mind|volume=18|issue=4|pages=52\u201359|publisher=Scientific American|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0807-52|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nA study by [[Northeastern University]] found that \"four times the number of children were killed in schools in the early 1990s than today\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/02/26/schools-are-still-one-of-the-safest-places-for-children-researcher-says/|title=Schools are safer than they were in the 90s, and school shootings are not more common than they used to be, researchers say|access-date=March 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 2018, [[NPR]] reported that a U.S. Education Department report, released earlier in the year, for the 2015\u20132016 school year said \"nearly 240 schools ... reported at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting\".

One suggestion that has come up is the idea to allow firearms in the classroom. \"Since the issue of arming teachers is a relatively new topic, it has received little empirical study. Therefore, most of the literature does not come from peer reviewed sources but rather published news reports. In addition, most of these reports are not objective and clearly appear to support a specific side of the debate.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=Teachers with Guns: Firearms Discharges by School teachers, 1980\u20132012 |url= http://homicidecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Teachers-with-Guns-RESEARCH-REPORT-FINAL.pdf|website=Homicidecenter.org|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |page=3 |date=2013}}</ref> So far, data has been inconclusive as to whether or not arming teachers would have any sort of benefit for schools. For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\n\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\n\nTo diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: \n* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. \n* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. \n* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}</ref>\n* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=August 1, 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"[[weapons effect]]\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz & LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks.

According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\n\nA 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.<ref>\"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home\". ''Christian Science Monitor''. October 31, 2013.</ref>\n\nMost states have Child Access Prevention Laws \u2013 laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. An example of a weaker law is a law that enforces liability only in the event of reckless, knowing or deliberate behavior by the adult.<ref>{{cite web|author=Randich, Cheri|title=Description of State Child Access Prevention Laws.|publisher=Law & Justice|date=December 10, 2012|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Documents/SummaryOfStateChildAccessPreventionLaws.pdf|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}<</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the [[United States Secret Service]] released an analysis of targeted school violence, concluding the best practice for prevention was forming a \"multidisciplinary [[threat assessment]] team, in conjunction with the appropriate policies, tools, and training\".<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/data/protection/ntac/usss-analysis-of-targeted-school-violence.pdf |title=Protecting America's Schools: A U.S. Secret Service Analysis of Targeted School Violence |date=November 2019 |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |author=National Threat Assessment Center, United States Secret Service |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> An earlier report published in 2018 concluded there was no single profile of a student attacker, and emphasized the importance of the threat assessment process instead.

For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.<ref name=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health\">{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}</ref> Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period.

In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%\u201350%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M.

However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\n\nData from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/|title=The gun's not in the closet|date=Aug 2018}}</ref> The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting.

The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children.\"\n\n'''\"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet\"'''\n\"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal of time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects.\"\n\nThis last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.\n \n[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}</ref> Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents.

While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the [[nervous system]] in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, [[axons]], [[neurons]], and [[synapses]], to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. ''pruning'' (or [[apoptosis]], otherwise known as ''cell death'').<ref>Feinberg, Irwin \u2013 [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-synaptic-pruning-important-for-the-developing-brain/ Why synaptic pruning is important for the developing brain] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref> These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the [[pre-frontal cortex]], the brain location where [[decision-making]] occurs, is the concluding area for development.

One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse.

A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\n\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\n\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 & Spencer, 2009). Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.\n\n==Frequency trends==\nSchool shootings are a \"modern phenomenon\".

For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\n\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\n\nTo diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: \n* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. \n* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. \n* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}</ref>\n* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=August 1, 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"[[weapons effect]]\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz & LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks.

According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\n\nA 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.<ref>\"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home\". ''Christian Science Monitor''. October 31, 2013.</ref>\n\nMost states have Child Access Prevention Laws \u2013 laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury.

One night, while working a bar shift, a patron talked to him about his wrestling background and invited him to work with some young [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artists]] on their wrestling. Shortly after this, he decided to pursue a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) career.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Early career===\nFerguson began his professional MMA career fighting in small organizations around California in 2007. Notable matches in his early career include a win over kickboxing champion [[Joe Schilling]] and a loss to future WEC fighter [[Karen Darabedyan]].\n\n===The Ultimate Fighter===\nFerguson applied to compete in the UFC's reality series \"The Ultimate Fighter\" multiple times.

He was the starting defensive back for the 2000 Division 8 state football champions and was a three-time All-State selection in wrestling, winning the 152-lb division in 2002.\n\nAfter high school, Ferguson enrolled at [[Central Michigan University]] before transferring to [[Grand Valley State University]]. He also did a stint at [[Muskegon Community College]]. He did not complete his degree, but had a successful collegiate wrestling career, winning the 2006 [[National Collegiate Wrestling Association]] national wrestling championship in the 165-lb division.<ref name=GVSUwrestling/>\n\nFollowing college, Ferguson moved back to California to be closer to his extended family, working in marketing and sales during the day and picking up shifts as a bartender at night. One night, while working a bar shift, a patron talked to him about his wrestling background and invited him to work with some young [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artists]] on their wrestling. Shortly after this, he decided to pursue a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) career.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Early career===\nFerguson began his professional MMA career fighting in small organizations around California in 2007. Notable matches in his early career include a win over kickboxing champion [[Joe Schilling]] and a loss to future WEC fighter [[Karen Darabedyan]].\n\n===The Ultimate Fighter===\nFerguson applied to compete in the UFC's reality series \"The Ultimate Fighter\" multiple times. In 2010, he was finally accepted to compete in season 13 of the series after amassing a 10-2 professional record and winning the welterweight championship in PureCombat. He competed as a welterweight on [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Lesnar vs. Team dos Santos]].\n\nFerguson was selected as the third pick for Team Lesnar. In his first fight, Ferguson defeated [[Justin Edwards (fighter)|Justin Edwards]] by knockout in the first round. He next faced Ryan McGillivray in the quarterfinals and won by a TKO in the first round. He then faced [[Chuck O'Neil]] in the semifinals and won by TKO in the third round to advance to the final.\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nFerguson officially made his UFC debut at [[the Ultimate Fighter 13 Finale]] against [[Ramsey Nijem]] to determine the winner of [[The Ultimate Fighter 13]].

It is the first of nine cantatas on texts by [[Christiana Mariana von Ziegler]], which Bach composed at the end of his second annual cycle of cantatas in Leipzig. Based on the Gospel reading from the [[Farewell Discourse]], where Jesus, announcing that he will leave, says \"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\", Bach contrasts music of sorrow and joy, notably in the unusual first [[Movement (music)|movement]], where he inserts an almost operatic [[recitative]] of Jesus in the [[fugal]] choral setting. The architecture of the movement combines elements of the usual [[Concerto grosso|concerto]] form with the more text-related older form of a [[motet]]. Bach scores an unusual [[flauto piccolo]] (descant [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] in D) as an [[obbligato]] instrument in an [[aria]] contemplating the sorrow of missing Jesus, who is addressed as a doctor who shall heal the wounds of sins. Bach scores a [[trumpet]] in only one movement, an aria expressing the joy about the predicted return of Jesus. The cantata in six movements closes with a [[chorale]], the ninth [[stanza]] of [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s [[hymn]] \"{{lang|de|Barmherzger Vater, h\u00f6chster Gott|italic=no}}\".\n\n== History and words ==\n\nBach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the [[Church cantata#Third Sunday after Easter (Jubilate)|Third Sunday after Easter]], called [[Jubilate Sunday|Jubilate]]. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the [[First Epistle of Peter]], \"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man\" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Peter|chapter=2|verse=11|range=\u201320}}), and from the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus announcing his [[second coming]] in the so-called [[Farewell Discourse]], saying \"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=John|chapter=16|verse=16|range=\u201323}}). For this occasion Bach had already composed in 1714 {{lang|de|[[Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12|''Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen'', BWV 12]] |italic=unset}}, which he used later as the basis for the movement {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} in his [[Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\nIn his second year in Leipzig, Bach composed [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantatas]] between the first Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] and [[Palm Sunday]], but for [[Easter]] he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his [[librettist]].<ref name=\"Wolff\" /> Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and [[Pentecost]] are based on texts by [[Christiana Mariana von Ziegler]], this one being the first of the series especially written for Bach.<ref name=\"Hofmann\" /> He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the ''[[St John Passion]]''.<ref name=\"Gardiner 2006\" />\n\nThe librettist begins with a quotation from the Gospel, verse 20, and concludes with the ninth [[stanza]] of [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s [[hymn]] \"{{lang|de|Barmherzger Vater, h\u00f6chster Gott|italic=no}}\" (1653).<ref name=\"chorale text\" /> Her own poetry reflects, in a sequence of [[recitative]]s and [[aria]]s, in two movements sadness at the loss of Jesus, and in two others joy at his predicted return. Bach edited her writing considerably, for example in movement 4, excising two lines of four and rephrasing the others.<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\nBach first performed the cantata on 22 April 1725 with the [[Thomanerchor]]. For later performances, he revised the instrumentation, replacing the flauto piccolo by a [[flauto traverso]].<ref name=\"Wolff\" />\n\n== Scoring and structure ==\n\n[[File:Different Sizes of Recorders.JPG|thumb|350px|The size of a D-descant recorder (sixth flute) is between the two smallest ones illustrated here.]]\nThe cantata in six movements is scored for three vocal soloists ([[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]), a [[SATB|four-part choir]], [[trumpet]], [[flauto piccolo]] (descant [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] in D), two [[oboe d'amore|oboes d'amore]], two [[violin]]s, [[viola]] and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]].<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\n# Chorus and arioso (bass): {{lang|de|Ihr werdet weinen und heulen|italic=no}}\n# Recitative (tenor): {{lang|de|Wer sollte nicht in Klagen untergehn|italic=no}}\n# Aria (alto): {{lang|de|Kein Arzt ist au\u00dfer dir zu finden|italic=no}}\n# Recitative (alto): {{lang|de|Du wirst mich nach der Angst auch wiederum erquicken|italic=no}}\n# Aria (tenor): {{lang|de|Erholet euch, betr\u00fcbte Sinnen|italic=no}}\n# Chorale: {{lang|de|Ich hab dich einen Augenblick|italic=no}}\n\n== Music ==\nThe cantata begins in [[B minor]], illustrating sorrow, but in  movement 4 shifts to the relative major key of [[D major]], illustrating the theme of consolation in Ziegler's text.<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\nThe opening chorus has an unusual structure, which includes an [[arioso]] passage for the bass voice. All instruments except the trumpet play a [[ritornello]], after which a choral [[fugue]] pictures the weeping and wailing of the text in unrelated musical material, rich in [[chromatic]]ism. In great contrast the following line, \"{{lang|de|aber die Welt wird sich freuen|italic=no}}\" (But the world will rejoice),<ref name=\"Dellal\" /> is conveyed by the chorus embedded in a repeat of the first part of the ritornello. The sequence is repeated on a larger scale: this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second [[Theme (music)|theme]] taken from the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety.

It is the first of nine cantatas on texts by [[Christiana Mariana von Ziegler]], which Bach composed at the end of his second annual cycle of cantatas in Leipzig. Based on the Gospel reading from the [[Farewell Discourse]], where Jesus, announcing that he will leave, says \"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\", Bach contrasts music of sorrow and joy, notably in the unusual first [[Movement (music)|movement]], where he inserts an almost operatic [[recitative]] of Jesus in the [[fugal]] choral setting. The architecture of the movement combines elements of the usual [[Concerto grosso|concerto]] form with the more text-related older form of a [[motet]]. Bach scores an unusual [[flauto piccolo]] (descant [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] in D) as an [[obbligato]] instrument in an [[aria]] contemplating the sorrow of missing Jesus, who is addressed as a doctor who shall heal the wounds of sins. Bach scores a [[trumpet]] in only one movement, an aria expressing the joy about the predicted return of Jesus. The cantata in six movements closes with a [[chorale]], the ninth [[stanza]] of [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s [[hymn]] \"{{lang|de|Barmherzger Vater, h\u00f6chster Gott|italic=no}}\".\n\n== History and words ==\n\nBach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the [[Church cantata#Third Sunday after Easter (Jubilate)|Third Sunday after Easter]], called [[Jubilate Sunday|Jubilate]]. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the [[First Epistle of Peter]], \"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man\" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Peter|chapter=2|verse=11|range=\u201320}}), and from the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus announcing his [[second coming]] in the so-called [[Farewell Discourse]], saying \"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=John|chapter=16|verse=16|range=\u201323}}). For this occasion Bach had already composed in 1714 {{lang|de|[[Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12|''Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen'', BWV 12]] |italic=unset}}, which he used later as the basis for the movement {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} in his [[Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\nIn his second year in Leipzig, Bach composed [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantatas]] between the first Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] and [[Palm Sunday]], but for [[Easter]] he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his [[librettist]].<ref name=\"Wolff\" /> Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and [[Pentecost]] are based on texts by [[Christiana Mariana von Ziegler]], this one being the first of the series especially written for Bach.<ref name=\"Hofmann\" /> He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the ''[[St John Passion]]''.<ref name=\"Gardiner 2006\" />\n\nThe librettist begins with a quotation from the Gospel, verse 20, and concludes with the ninth [[stanza]] of [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s [[hymn]] \"{{lang|de|Barmherzger Vater, h\u00f6chster Gott|italic=no}}\" (1653).<ref name=\"chorale text\" /> Her own poetry reflects, in a sequence of [[recitative]]s and [[aria]]s, in two movements sadness at the loss of Jesus, and in two others joy at his predicted return. Bach edited her writing considerably, for example in movement 4, excising two lines of four and rephrasing the others.<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\nBach first performed the cantata on 22 April 1725 with the [[Thomanerchor]]. For later performances, he revised the instrumentation, replacing the flauto piccolo by a [[flauto traverso]].<ref name=\"Wolff\" />\n\n== Scoring and structure ==\n\n[[File:Different Sizes of Recorders.JPG|thumb|350px|The size of a D-descant recorder (sixth flute) is between the two smallest ones illustrated here.]]\nThe cantata in six movements is scored for three vocal soloists ([[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]), a [[SATB|four-part choir]], [[trumpet]], [[flauto piccolo]] (descant [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] in D), two [[oboe d'amore|oboes d'amore]], two [[violin]]s, [[viola]] and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]].<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\n# Chorus and arioso (bass): {{lang|de|Ihr werdet weinen und heulen|italic=no}}\n# Recitative (tenor): {{lang|de|Wer sollte nicht in Klagen untergehn|italic=no}}\n# Aria (alto): {{lang|de|Kein Arzt ist au\u00dfer dir zu finden|italic=no}}\n# Recitative (alto): {{lang|de|Du wirst mich nach der Angst auch wiederum erquicken|italic=no}}\n# Aria (tenor): {{lang|de|Erholet euch, betr\u00fcbte Sinnen|italic=no}}\n# Chorale: {{lang|de|Ich hab dich einen Augenblick|italic=no}}\n\n== Music ==\nThe cantata begins in [[B minor]], illustrating sorrow, but in  movement 4 shifts to the relative major key of [[D major]], illustrating the theme of consolation in Ziegler's text.<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\nThe opening chorus has an unusual structure, which includes an [[arioso]] passage for the bass voice. All instruments except the trumpet play a [[ritornello]], after which a choral [[fugue]] pictures the weeping and wailing of the text in unrelated musical material, rich in [[chromatic]]ism. In great contrast the following line, \"{{lang|de|aber die Welt wird sich freuen|italic=no}}\" (But the world will rejoice),<ref name=\"Dellal\" /> is conveyed by the chorus embedded in a repeat of the first part of the ritornello. The sequence is repeated on a larger scale: this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second [[Theme (music)|theme]] taken from the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety. The bass as the [[vox Christi]] (voice of Christ) sings three times, with a sudden tempo change to [[Tempo (music)|adagio]], \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber werdet traurig sein|italic=no}}\" (But you will be sad)<ref name=\"Dellal\" /> as an accompagnato recitative. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes: \"This recitative is a mere eight bars long but its context and piteousness give it enormous dramatic impact. Bach's lack of respect for the conservative Leipzig authorities' dislike of operatic styles in religious music was never more apparent!\"<ref name=\"Mincham\" /> [[Klaus Hofmann]] compares the recitative's \"highly expressive melody and harmony\" to Bach's [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]].<ref name=\"Hofmann\" /> Finally, the extended sequence of fugue and ritornello with chorus returns transposed, on the text \"{{lang|de|Doch eure Traurigkeit soll in Freude verkehret werden|italic=no}}\" (Yet your sorrow shall be changed into joy).<ref name=\"Dellal\" /> According to [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]], the architecture of the movement is a large scale experiment combining elements of the older style of a text-related [[motet]] with the form of a concerto of instrumental groups and voices, as typically used by Bach.<ref name=\"D\u00fcrr\" />\n\n[[File:John Eliot Gardiner at rehearsal in Wroclaw cropped portrait.jpeg|thumb|John Eliot Gardiner, 2007]]\n[[John Eliot Gardiner]], who conducted the [[Bach Cantata Pilgrimage]] with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, notes that Bach's \"strategy is to superimpose these opposite moods, binding them in a mutually enlightening whole and emphasising that it is the same God who both dispenses and then ameliorates these conditions.<ref name=\"Gardiner\" />\n\nMovement 2 is a secco recitative for tenor, concluding in an arioso section with a \"deeply moving\" [[melisma]] on the word \"{{lang|de|Schmerzen|italic=no}}\" (sorrows).<ref name=\"Mincham\" /> Movement 3, \"{{lang|de|Kein Arzt ist au\u00dfer dir zu finden|italic=no}}\" (Besides You is no doctor to be found)<ref name=\"Dellal\" /> is an [[aria]] for alto with the [[obbligato]] flauto piccolo, which according to Mincham, employs a \"figuration ever striving upwards, moderates the underlying sense of potential tragedy\".<ref name=\"Mincham\" /> The alto recitative \"marks a change of scene\", it begins in B minor, like the opening chorus, but modulates to D-major and ends with a wide-ranging [[coloratura]] marking the word \"{{lang|de|Freude|italic=no}}\" (joy).<ref name=\"Hofmann\" /><ref name=\"Mincham\" /> Movement 5, \"{{lang|de|Erholet euch, betr\u00fcbte Sinnen|italic=no}}\" (Recover now, O troubled feelings),<ref name=\"Dellal\" /> picks up the joyful coloraturas, supported by the trumpet and fanfares in [[Triad (music)|triads]] in the orchestra,<ref name=\"Hofmann\" /> Mincham notes that the trumpet \"bursts upon us with an energy, acclamation and jubilation unheard, so far, in this work\".<ref name=\"Mincham\" /> The cantata is closed with a four-part setting of the [[chorale]], sung to the melody of \"{{lang|de|Was mein Gott will, das g'scheh allzeit|italic=no}}\"<ref name=\"chorale melody\" /> which Bach used frequently, including in his ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''.<ref name=\"Mincham\" />\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe entries of the following table are taken from the listing on the Bach Cantatas Website.<ref name=\"Oron\" /> For several recordings, the name of the bass soloist is not provided.

In order to advance onto the \"D\"-level license and beyond, the user must complete a number of races with little to no accidents, off-track incidents, or losses of control. As the user achieves the higher-level licenses, they qualify to compete in more official series.\n\nFor the standard official series managed by iRacing, each calendar year is normally divided into four 12-week seasons, with all driving sessions in a series taking place on one track for each week during the 12-week seasons.<ref>{{cite book |chapter = 4.2.

Sessions |title = FIRST Official Sporting Code}}</ref> Week 13, in general, has a more relaxed attitude, with an emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Week 13 is often plagued with server issues, as the purpose of the week is for the implementation of software updates. There are also non-standard series, examples of which are the four-week Rookie series, IndyCar, Skip Barber and Grand-Am Premier series, and Pro series.<ref>{{cite book |chapter = 4.2.5. Rookie Series |title = FIRST Official Sporting Code}}</ref> Races that are organized by members do not have to follow any official schedule. The series are divided into two main categories, oval and road, which are further divided into several license level series from Rookie to Pro, and a driver must earn each license to be eligible to participate in official race week sessions at their license level. If not qualified for the correct license for a series, drivers can still participate in practice sessions.<ref>{{cite book |chapter = 2.9. Series Eligibility |title = FIRST Official Sporting Code}}</ref> Earning a higher license involves both participation in competitions on a driver's current highest license level and achievement of a minimum safety record.

In order to advance onto the \"D\"-level license and beyond, the user must complete a number of races with little to no accidents, off-track incidents, or losses of control. As the user achieves the higher-level licenses, they qualify to compete in more official series.\n\nFor the standard official series managed by iRacing, each calendar year is normally divided into four 12-week seasons, with all driving sessions in a series taking place on one track for each week during the 12-week seasons.<ref>{{cite book |chapter = 4.2.

It is based on a true story [[Forrest Gump,the 1986 book of the same name]] by [[Winston Groom]], and stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Mykelti Williamson]], and [[Sally Field]]. The story depicts several decades in the life of [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States. The film is based substantially from event of Forrest Gump life.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The [[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.\n\n''Forrest Gump'' was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received favorable reviews for Zemeckis' directing, Hanks' performance, the visual effects, the music and the script. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over {{US$|677{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the [[1994 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1994]]. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies.

It received many [[List of accolades received by Forrest Gump|award nominations]], including [[Golden Globe]]s, [[British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nVarying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism. In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Forrest Gump join Library of Congress film trove\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-11-240/2011-national-film-registry-more-than-a-box-of-chocolates/2011-12-28/|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/forrest-gump-bollywood-remake-works-1194721|title='Forrest Gump' Bollywood Remake in the Works|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn 1981, a white feather drifts down out of the sky and lands at a bus stop in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A man named Forrest Gump picks it up and places it in his copy of the children's book ''[[Curious George]]''. He then recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.\n\nIn 1951 in Greenbow, [[Alabama]], young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and is unable to walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young [[Elvis Presley]], who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his famous performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. It is implied that Jenny's father sexually abuses her.\n\nForrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. While fleeing from some bullies, his braces fall off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a [[American football|football]] [[scholarship]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1963; he witnesses [[List of governors of Alabama|Alabama Governor]] [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|stand in the schoolhouse door]], becomes a top [[kick returner]], is named to the [[College Football All-America Team|All-American team]], and meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] Following that, then Forrest remembers the Kennedy assassination, when [[Lee Harvey Oswald|somebody shot]] the President in [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963]] and [[Sirhan Sirhan|somebody shot]] his younger brother in [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|1968]].\n\nAfter his college graduation, Forrest enlists into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], where he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"Bubba\", who convinces Forrest to go into the [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] business with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], serving with the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] region. After a few routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. While trying to find Bubba, Forrest ends up finding and saving several wounded platoon-mates\u2014including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs\u2014and is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nAt the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] \"[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"|March on the Pentagon]]\" rally, Forrest meets [[Abbie Hoffman]] and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a [[hippie]] lifestyle. He also develops a talent for [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in [[ping-pong diplomacy]], earning him an interview alongside [[John Lennon]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. Following that, then Forrest remembers that [[Mark David Chapman|somebody shot]] John Lennon in [[Murder of John Lennon|1980]]. In [[New York City]], he spends the holidays and the 1972 new year with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an embittered cripple. Forrest soon meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and stays in the [[Watergate complex]], where he accidentally exposes the [[Watergate scandal]], forcing Nixon to resign in 1974. Forrest Gump is officially discharged from the army after the war ends.\n\nReturning to Greenbow, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre]], fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive [[Hurricane Carmen]], they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], after which Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Lieutenant Dan invests into [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer, Inc.]] and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also gives half of the earnings to Bubba's family, giving them a better life. Forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of [[cancer]].\n\nIn 1976, Jenny\u2014recovering from years of drugs and abuse returns to visit Forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. That night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running, and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again before returning home to Greenbow.\n\nIn the present, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. The strangers say that the address on the letter is only a few blocks away, and Forrest immediately takes off. As Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to their son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, so Forrest has Jenny and Forrest Jr move back to Greenbow with him. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, with Lt. Dan serving as best man while wearing his new prosthetic legs. Sadly, Jenny is overcome by the virus and dies a year later. At her grave some time later, Forrest tells Jenny that he had her father's house bulldozed to the ground, and that little Forrest is doing well. The film ends with Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school. Forrest notices that Jr has his ''Curious George'' book, as he wants to take it to school for show-and-tell. When Forrest opens the book, the white feather from the beginning of the film falls to the ground. He waves goodbye to Forrest Jr as the school bus leaves, and then sits down on a log as the wind blows and carries the feather back into the sky.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Tom Hanks]] (left) and [[Gary Sinise]] (right) on the film set in 1993.\n| image1 = TomHanksForrestGump94.jpg\n| width1 = 149\n| alt1 = A man is at the center of the image smiling into the camera.

It is based on [[Forrest Gump (novel)|the 1986 novel of the same name]] by [[Winston Groom]], and stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Mykelti Williamson]], and [[Sally Field]]. The story depicts several decades in the life of [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The [[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.\n\n''Forrest Gump'' was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received favorable reviews for Zemeckis' directing, Hanks' performance, the visual effects, the music and the script. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over {{US$|677{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the [[1994 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1994]]. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. ''Forrest Gump'' won the [[Academy Awards]] for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many [[List of accolades received by Forrest Gump|award nominations]], including [[Golden Globe]]s, [[British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nVarying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism.

A man named Forrest Gump picks it up and places it in his copy of the children's book ''[[Curious George]]''. He then recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.\n\nIn 1951 in Greenbow, [[Alabama]], young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and is unable to walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young [[Elvis Presley]], who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his famous performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. It is implied that Jenny's father sexually abuses her.\n\nForrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. While fleeing from some bullies, his braces fall off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a [[American football|football]] [[scholarship]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1963; he witnesses [[List of governors of Alabama|Alabama Governor]] [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|stand in the schoolhouse door]], becomes a top [[kick returner]], is named to the [[College Football All-America Team|All-American team]], and meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] Following that, then Forrest remembers the Kennedy assassination, when [[Lee Harvey Oswald|somebody shot]] the President in [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963]] and [[Sirhan Sirhan|somebody shot]] his younger brother in [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|1968]].\n\nAfter his college graduation, Forrest enlists into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], where he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"Bubba\", who convinces Forrest to go into the [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] business with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], serving with the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] region. After a few routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. While trying to find Bubba, Forrest ends up finding and saving several wounded platoon-mates\u2014including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs\u2014and is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nAt the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] \"[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"|March on the Pentagon]]\" rally, Forrest meets [[Abbie Hoffman]] and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a [[hippie]] lifestyle. He also develops a talent for [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in [[ping-pong diplomacy]], earning him an interview alongside [[John Lennon]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. Following that, then Forrest remembers that [[Mark David Chapman|somebody shot]] John Lennon in [[Murder of John Lennon|1980]]. In [[New York City]], he spends the holidays and the 1972 new year with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an embittered cripple. Forrest soon meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and stays in the [[Watergate complex]], where he accidentally exposes the [[Watergate scandal]], forcing Nixon to resign in 1974. Forrest Gump is officially discharged from the army after the war ends.\n\nReturning to Greenbow, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre]], fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive [[Hurricane Carmen]], they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], after which Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Lieutenant Dan invests into [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer, Inc.]] and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also gives half of the earnings to Bubba's family, giving them a better life. Forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of [[cancer]].\n\nIn 1976, Jenny\u2014recovering from years of drugs and abuse returns to visit Forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. That night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running, and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again before returning home to Greenbow.\n\nIn the present, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. The strangers say that the address on the letter is only a few blocks away, and Forrest immediately takes off. As Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to their son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, so Forrest has Jenny and Forrest Jr move back to Greenbow with him. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, with Lt. Dan serving as best man while wearing his new prosthetic legs. Sadly, Jenny is overcome by the virus and dies a year later. At her grave some time later, Forrest tells Jenny that he had her father's house bulldozed to the ground, and that little Forrest is doing well. The film ends with Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school. Forrest notices that Jr has his ''Curious George'' book, as he wants to take it to school for show-and-tell. When Forrest opens the book, the white feather from the beginning of the film falls to the ground. He waves goodbye to Forrest Jr as the school bus leaves, and then sits down on a log as the wind blows and carries the feather back into the sky.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Tom Hanks]] (left) and [[Gary Sinise]] (right) on the film set in 1993.\n| image1 = TomHanksForrestGump94.jpg\n| width1 = 149\n| alt1 = A man is at the center of the image smiling into the camera.
