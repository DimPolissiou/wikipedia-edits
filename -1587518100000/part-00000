Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.\n\nTypical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20\u201321}}\n* [[Quartz]]: SiO<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Calcite]]: CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\n* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6ssacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]\nParent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.\n\nResidual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}\n\nMost soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.\n* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60\u201390 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.\n* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.\n* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.\n* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].\n\nCumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.\n\n=====Weathering=====\nThe [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of \"shells\". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity.

In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.\n\nThe terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:\n\n# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard\n# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm\n# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic\n# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62\u201363, 565\u201367}}\n\nSoil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.\n\n===Temperature===\n{{Further|Soil thermal properties|Heat capacity|Thermal conduction}}\n\nSoil [[temperature]] depends

The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:\n\n: <math>q_x  = - k \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta x}</math>\n\nIn [[SI]] units\n: <math>q</math> is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>\n: <math>k</math> is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7[[Kelvin|K]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.\n: <math>\\delta T</math> is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].\n: <math>\\delta x</math> is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.\n\nHeat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x, the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Soil classification}}\n\nSoil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil in a particular region. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications.

Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]).

Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity.

It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.\n[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]\n\n[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.\n\nA serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.\n\nSoil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface.

[[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] with higher levels of applied water in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands | year = 1993 | publisher = Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 978-0-16-061623-5}}</ref><ref name=\"Waterlog\">{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816225219/http://www.waterlog.info/ |archivedate=16 August 2010  }}</ref>\n\n==Reclamation==\nSoils which contain high levels of particular clays, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.\n\nMany farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.\n\nIn 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.<ref name=\"Water Management Institute2010\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |author=International Water Management Institute}}</ref>\n\nIf the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition.

Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.\n\nTypical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20\u201321}}\n* [[Quartz]]: SiO<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Calcite]]: CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\n* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6ssacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]\nParent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.\n\nResidual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}\n\nMost soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.\n* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60\u201390 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.\n* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.\n* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.\n* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].\n\nCumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.\n\n=====Weathering=====\nThe [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.\n## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5\u201350&nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.\n## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1\u201310&nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.\n# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type\n## Very fine or very thin: <1&nbsp;mm platy and spherical; <5&nbsp;mm blocky; <10&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Fine or thin: 1\u20132&nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5\u201310&nbsp;mm blocky; 10\u201320&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Medium: 2\u20135&nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10\u201320&nbsp;mm blocky; 20\u201350 prismlike.\n## Coarse or thick: 5\u201310&nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20\u201350&nbsp;mm blocky; 50\u2013100&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Very coarse or very thick: >10&nbsp;mm platy, granular; >50&nbsp;mm blocky; >100&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.\n## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.\n## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.\n## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.\n## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.\n\nAt the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink\u2013swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishn\u00e9 |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.\n\nThe terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:\n\n# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard\n# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm\n# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic\n# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62\u201363, 565\u201367}}\n\nSoil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads.

The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction.

The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.\n: <math>\\delta T</math> is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].\n: <math>\\delta x</math> is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.\n\nHeat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign.

As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished \u2013 this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.<ref name=\"Roy2006Chapter4\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf |title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management |last1=Roy |first1=R.

However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion, also called [[Brownian motion]], of molecules within a gradient of decreasing concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kramers |first=Hendrik Anthony |year=1940 |title=Brownian motion in a field of force and the diffusion model of chemical reactions |journal=[[Physica (journal)|Physica]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=284\u2013304 |url=http://fy.chalmers.se/~frtbm/NonlinearDynamics/Kramers.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(40)90098-2 |accessdate=11 August 2019 |bibcode=1940Phy.....7..284K }}</ref> By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as [[transpiration]] has almost stopped following [[stoma]]tal closure.

Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].<ref name=\"Foth1984\"/> Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing soil [[porosity]]. Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter. However, humus may persist over centuries if not millennia.\n\n===Climatological influence===\nThe production, accumulation and degradation of organic matter are greatly dependent on climate.

That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Soil classification}}\n\nSoil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil in a particular region. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications.

Soils degradation involves the [[Soil acidification|acidification]], [[soil contamination|contamination]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]] or [[Soil salinity|salination]].\n\n[[Soil acidification]] is beneficial in the case of alkaline soils, but it degrades land when it lowers crop productivity and increases soil vulnerability to contamination and erosion. Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].\n\n[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation. An example of diffuse pollution with contaminants is the copper distribution in agricultural soils mainly due to fungicide applications in vineyards and other permanent crops.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ballabio|first=Cristiano|last2=Panagos|first2=Panos|last3=Lugato|first3=Emanuele|last4=Huang|first4=Jen-How|last5=Orgiazzi|first5=Alberto|last6=Jones|first6=Arwyn|last7=Fern\u00e1ndez-Ugalde|first7=Oihane|last8=Borrelli|first8=Pasquale|last9=Montanarella|first9=Luca|date=2018-09-15|title=Copper distribution in European topsoils: An assessment based on LUCAS soil survey|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=636|pages=282\u2013298|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.268|pmid=29709848|issn=0048-9697|bibcode=2018ScTEn.636..282B}}</ref>\n[[File:Soil erosion, Southfield - geograph.org.uk - 367917.jpg|thumb|Desertification]]\n\n[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.\n[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]\n\n[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.\n\nA serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.\n\nSoil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602\u201310 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}</ref> The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dooley|first=Alan|title=Sandboils 101: Corps has experience dealing with common flood danger | website = Engineer Update|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers\n|date=June 2006|url=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/jun06/story8.htm|accessdate = 14 May 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418185527/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/jun06/story8.htm |archivedate = 18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.<ref>{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18\u201334 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> All irrigation water has some level of salinity.

For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.\n\nMany farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.\n\nIn 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.<ref name=\"Water Management Institute2010\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |author=International Water Management Institute}}</ref>\n\nIf the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition.

{"title_page": "Politics of Bermuda", "text_new": "{{Politics of Bermuda}}\n{{Update|date=November 2010}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n\nBermuda is the oldest self-governing [[British Overseas Territory]] and has a great degree of internal autonomy. Its parliament held its first session in 1620, making it the third-oldest continuous parliament in the world. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is head of state and is represented in Bermuda by a [[governor]], whom she appoints on the advice of the British government. The governor has [[reserved powers|special responsibilities]] in four areas: external affairs, defence, internal security, and policing.\n\nInternally, [[Bermuda]] is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]]. The premier is the [[head of government]], and there is a [[multi-party system]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Military defence is officially the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]], but Bermuda maintains its own [[Military of Bermuda|military force.]]\n\nBermuda participates, through British delegations, in the [[United Nations|UN]] and some of its specialized and related agencies. The [[United Nations]] Committee on Decolonization includes Bermuda on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].\n\n==History==\nThe original system of government was created under the Virginia Company, which colonised Bermuda, accidentally in 1609, and deliberately from 1612. The [[London Company|Virginia Company]] lost its Royal Charter for North America (\"Virginia\") in 1622, and the Crown assumed responsibility for the administration of the continental colony. Bermuda, however, passed in 1615 to a new company, The [[Somers Isles Company]] (The Somers Isles being the other official name of the colony), formed by the same shareholders. The House of Assembly was created under that company, which continued to appoint governors until it was dissolved in 1684, with the Crown assuming responsibility for the Colony's administration. The Crown left in place the political system created under the Company. The Colonial Parliament originally consisted only of the lower house. The ''Privy Council'', an appointed body, served in the roles of an upper house and a cabinet. The President of The Council could find himself temporarily acting as governor when no governor was present.\n\nVoting was originally restricted to male landowners. When the numbers of non-white landowners began to increase, a minimum value was established for the properties which entitled their owners to vote. In 1960, this was \u00a360. A man could vote in each parish in which he owned sufficiently valuable land \u2013 giving the richest whites as many as nine votes each if they so desired.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Fodor\n | first = Eugene, ed.\n | year = 1960\n | title = Fodor's Guide to the Caribbean, Bahamas and Bermuda\n | publisher = David McKay Co\n | location = New York\n}}</ref>\n\nSince 1968 Bermuda has had a constitution that sets out its structure of government.<ref> http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Bermuda%20Constitution%20Order%201968.pdf Bermuda Constitution Order 1968]</ref> The constitution provides the island with formal responsibility for internal self-government, while the British Government retained responsibility for external affairs, defence, and security. The Bermudian Government is always consulted on any international negotiations affecting the territory. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Parliament of Bermuda|Parliament]]. The party system is dominated by the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] and the [[One Bermuda Alliance]], while prior to 1998 it had been dominated by the [[United Bermuda Party]].\n\n==Executive branch==\n[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], head of state of Bermuda]]\n\nThe governor is appointed by the monarch. The governor invites the leader of largest party in Parliament to form a government as premier. The [[Premier of Bermuda|premier]] is head of government and leader of the majority party in the elected House of Assembly. The [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] is composed of 14 members selected by the premier from among members of the [[bicameral parliament]] consisting of the nominated [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] and the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]].\n\nThe governor appoints a number of senior government positions, including the [[puisne judge]]s, police commissioner, the auditor general and the parliamentary registrar.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

The House of Assembly was originally composed of 40 members from 20 electoral districts (two representatives from each district) for a term not to exceed 5 years. As the districts, based on the old parish boundaries, contained significantly differing numbers of voters ([[malapportionment]]), that body was replaced in 2002 with a 36-member House elected from single-seat electoral districts of roughly equal population for a five-year term. The Senate, called the [[Legislative Council]] until 1980, is the revising chamber and serves concurrently with the House of Assembly. There are 11 senators: five appointed by the governor in consultation with the premier; three in consultation with the [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]; and three at the governor's discretion.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Bermuda|Elections in Bermuda}}\n\nThe latest election results for the House of Assembly are as follows:\n{{Main|Bermudian general election, 2017}}\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Party\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/\u2013\n|-\n|align=left|[[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]]||20,059||58.89||24||+7\n|-\n|align=left|[[One Bermuda Alliance]]||13,832||40.61||12||\u22127\n|-\n|align=left|Independents||169||0.50||0||0\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||UNK||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left|'''Total'''||'''34,060'''||'''100'''||'''36'''||'''0'''\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||46,669||-||\u2013||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left colspan=5|Source: [http://www.elections.gov.bm/ Parliamentary Registry], [http://electionguide.org/results.php?ID=1951 IFES]\n|}\n\n==Judicial branch==\nThe Magistrates' Court is a creature of statute. Its jurisdiction includes: adjudicating on small claims in civil matters, dealing with a number of regulatory applications, trial of summary criminal offences and serving as examining justices on indictable matters (that is, determining if there is sufficient evidence to commit a criminal suspect for trial on indictment in the Supreme Court).\n\nThe Supreme Court has inherent original jurisdiction for most civil matters, with concurrent jurisdiction in common law and equity. The Supreme Court also deals with trials on indictment (that is, the most serious criminal matters). The Supreme Court can judicially review government action in accordance with the principles of [[Administrative Law]] and entertain petitions that laws or public acts are contrary to the Constitution of Bermuda. It also has appellate jurisdiction on matters from the Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction on matters from the Supreme Court.\n\nThe [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court on all matters from Bermuda.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nBermuda has two municipal [[Administrative division|subnational entities]]: the city of Hamilton and the town of St. George.  There are also nine traditional parishes, but these have no administrative or legal role.  When Bermuda was first colonised, the territory was divided between eight primary landowners (the shareholders of the Bermuda Company) in equal allotments, and public land (St. George's); these divisions, then called \"Tribes\", came to be known as \"Parishes\".  Until the late 20th century, the parishes maintained their own community councils responsible for such functions as birth records. Today, the Bermuda parishes are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bernews.com/government/parishes-of-bermuda/|title=Parishes of Bermuda Parishes|website=Bernews|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>\n\n# Sandys\n# Southampton\n# Warwick\n# Paget\n# Pembroke\n# Devonshire\n# Smith's\n# Hamilton \n# St. George's\n\n==International organization participation==\n[[Caricom]] (associate), CCC, ICFTU, [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] (subbureau), IOC\n\n==Political conditions==\nBermuda's first political party, the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] (PLP), was formed in February 1963 with predominantly black and working class adherents. Its leadership quickly became dominated by West Indian Bermudians (the 20th century had seen considerable immigration from the West Indies, resulting in profound social and political changes in Bermuda). In 1965, the two-party system was launched with the formation of the [[United Bermuda Party]] (UBP), which had the support of the majority of white voters and of some blacks. A third party, the [[Bermuda Democratic Alliance]] (BDA) (not to be confused with a party of the same name founded in 2009), was formed in the summer of 1967 with a splinter group from the PLP as a nucleus; it disbanded in 1970. It was later replaced by the [[National Liberal Party (Bermuda)|National Liberal Party]] (NLP) which contested elections until 2003 with no success.\n\nBermuda's first election held on the basis of universal adult suffrage and equal voting took place on 22 May 1968; previously, the franchise had been limited to property owners and those above the age of 21. Persons who owned land in one or more parishes could vote in each parish.  In the 1968 election, the UBP won 30 House of Assembly seats, while the PLP won 10 and the BDP lost the three seats it had previously held. The UBP continued to maintain control of the government, although by decreasing margins in the Assembly, until 1998 when the PLP won the general election for the first time with 54% of the popular vote and a 24-seat majority in the 40-member Assembly.  The PLP would succeed gaining a second term in July 2003, although by a reduced majority of 52% margin of the popular vote and 22 seats in a new 36-seat Assembly.  A leadership battle followed the election, resulting in the PLP's first Premier, Jennifer M. Smith (now Dame Jennifer) being ousted with [[William Alexander Scott]] chosen as new Party Leader and later Premier. In December 2007, after an October 2006 party leadership change in which Dr. [[Ewart F. Brown]], Jr. became Premier, the PLP gained a third term by maintaining a 52% margin of the popular vote and 22 out of 36 seats in the Assembly. [[Paula Cox]] replaced Brown as leader of the PLP, and therefore the Premier, in October 2010.\n\nUnsatisfied aspirations, particularly among young blacks, led to a brief civil disturbance in December 1977, following the execution of two men found guilty of the 1972\u201373 assassinations of Governor Sir [[Richard Sharples]] and four others. In the 1980s, the increasing prosperity of Bermudians, combined with limited land area, caused severe pressure in housing. Despite a general strike in 1981 and poor economic conditions worldwide during 1981\u201383, Bermuda's social, political, and economic institutions showed resilience and stability.\n\nBermuda's positive experience with internal self-government has led to discussions of possible complete independence by both parties. However, an [[Bermudan independence referendum, 1995|independence referendum]] called by a sharply divided UBP in the summer of 1995 was resoundingly defeated and resulted in the resignation of the Premier and UBP leader, Sir [[John Swan (Bermuda politician)|John Swan]]. Just over 58% of the electorate voted in the independence referendum, which had to be postponed one day due to disruptions caused by [[Hurricane Felix (1995)|Hurricane Felix]] in 1995. Of those voting, over 73% voted against independence, while only 25% voted in favour. The vote may not have been a true test of support for independence, however, as the Progressive Labour Party (PLP) urged its membership and supporters to boycott the referendum. The PLP stated that the unwillingness of the UBP government to put forward a plan of substantive constitutional reform made it impossible for it to support the referendum.\n\nThis was despite independence having been one of the PLP's central principles since the party's inception in 1963. In 1968, the PLP election platform stated that, \"No government can be either responsible or democratic while under the rule of another country. [[Colonialism]] is a cancer....Therefore we shall return to [[London]] to examine with the British Government what arrangements can be made for our independence.\"\n\nDespite the previous emphasis, any mention of independence was absent from the PLP's general election platform both in 1998, when the PLP first triumphed at the polls, and again in 2003. In fact, Premier [[Jennifer Meredith Smith|Jennifer M. Smith]] stated that she would not pursue independence during her first term. Again, in 2001, she made the following statement: \"As I have stated repeatedly, consistently and unequivocally since assuming the leadership of the Bermuda Progressive Labour Party, I shall state once again for the record \u2013 independence is not an issue that we will address in our first term and probably not in our second term....We believe that there are a number of areas that need addressing before Bermuda heads down this road.\"\n\nUnder the leadership of Smith, the Government of Bermuda began to systematically address the issues that it believes are fundamental prerequisites for independence. It very quickly enacted legislation providing for the elimination of annual voter registration. In 2001, the government began taking steps to amend Bermuda's constitution in order to abolish the island's system of parish-based, dual-seat constituencies which favored voters in parishes of small, predominantly white populations. The British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) prepared an [[Order in Council]] empowering the [[Constituency Boundaries Commission (Bermuda)|Constituency Boundaries Commission]] to recommend to the governor the number and boundaries of single-member constituencies into which Bermuda should be divided. The Commission held meetings with the public and concluded its deliberations. The governor then submitted the commission's report to the UK's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, together with the views of the House of Assembly. Finally, the FCO prepared a second Order in Council for presentation to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] to effect the proposals made by the commission, including constitutional amendments relating to electoral boundaries and representation.\n\nThe possibility of independence has relevance to newly enacted UK legislation entitling citizens of Britain's Overseas Territories, including Bermuda, to British citizenship. The British's Overseas Territories Act, passed in February 2002, provides automatic acquisition of British citizenship, including automatic transmission of citizenship to their children; the right of abode, including the right to live and work in Britain and the [[European Union]]; the right not to exercise or to formally renounce British citizenship; and the right to use the fast track EU/EEA channel at the airport, free of British immigration controls.\n\nA poll conducted by the ''Bermuda Sun'', a local semiweekly newspaper, reveals support for British citizenship\u2014however, that support largely comes from whites and the majority of blacks in the island\u2014that is, Bermuda's majority\u2014are not interested in British citizenship, opting rather to live and study in North America{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

Its parliament held its first session in 1620, making it the third-oldest continuous parliament in the world. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is head of state and is represented in Bermuda by a [[governor]], whom she appoints on the advice of the British government. The governor has [[reserved powers|special responsibilities]] in four areas: external affairs, defence, internal security, and policing.\n\nInternally, [[Bermuda]] is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]]. The premier is the [[head of government]], and there is a [[multi-party system]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Military defence is officially the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]], but Bermuda maintains its own [[Military of Bermuda|military force.]]\n\nBermuda participates, through British delegations, in the [[United Nations|UN]] and some of its specialized and related agencies. The [[United Nations]] Committee on Decolonization includes Bermuda on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].\n\n==History==\nThe original system of government was created under the Virginia Company, which colonised Bermuda, accidentally in 1609, and deliberately from 1612. The [[London Company|Virginia Company]] lost its Royal Charter for North America (\"Virginia\") in 1622, and the Crown assumed responsibility for the administration of the continental colony. Bermuda, however, passed in 1615 to a new company, The [[Somers Isles Company]] (The Somers Isles being the other official name of the colony), formed by the same shareholders. The House of Assembly was created under that company, which continued to appoint governors until it was dissolved in 1684, with the Crown assuming responsibility for the Colony's administration. The Crown left in place the political system created under the Company. The Colonial Parliament originally consisted only of the lower house. The ''Privy Council'', an appointed body, served in the roles of an upper house and a cabinet. The President of The Council could find himself temporarily acting as governor when no governor was present.\n\nVoting was originally restricted to male landowners. When the numbers of non-white landowners began to increase, a minimum value was established for the properties which entitled their owners to vote. In 1960, this was \u00a360. A man could vote in each parish in which he owned sufficiently valuable land \u2013 giving the richest whites as many as nine votes each if they so desired.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Fodor\n | first = Eugene, ed.\n | year = 1960\n | title = Fodor's Guide to the Caribbean, Bahamas and Bermuda\n | publisher = David McKay Co\n | location = New York\n}}</ref>\n\nSince 1968 Bermuda has had a constitution that sets out its structure of government.<ref> http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Bermuda%20Constitution%20Order%201968.pdf Bermuda Constitution Order 1968]</ref> The constitution provides the island with formal responsibility for internal self-government, while the British Government retained responsibility for external affairs, defence, and security. The Bermudian Government is always consulted on any international negotiations affecting the territory. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Parliament of Bermuda|Parliament]]. The party system is dominated by the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] and the [[One Bermuda Alliance]], while prior to 1998 it had been dominated by the [[United Bermuda Party]].\n\n==Executive branch==\n[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], head of state of Bermuda]]\n\nThe governor is appointed by the monarch. The governor invites the leader of largest party in Parliament to form a government as premier. The [[Premier of Bermuda|premier]] is head of government and leader of the majority party in the elected House of Assembly. The [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] is composed of 14 members selected by the premier from among members of the [[bicameral parliament]] consisting of the nominated [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] and the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]].\n\nThe governor appoints a number of senior government positions, including the [[puisne judge]]s, police commissioner, the auditor general and the parliamentary registrar.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

The House of Assembly was originally composed of 40 members from 20 electoral districts (two representatives from each district) for a term not to exceed 5 years. As the districts, based on the old parish boundaries, contained significantly differing numbers of voters ([[malapportionment]]), that body was replaced in 2002 with a 36-member House elected from single-seat electoral districts of roughly equal population for a five-year term. The Senate, called the [[Legislative Council]] until 1980, is the revising chamber and serves concurrently with the House of Assembly. There are 11 senators: five appointed by the governor in consultation with the premier; three in consultation with the [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]; and three at the governor's discretion.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Bermuda|Elections in Bermuda}}\n\nThe latest election results for the House of Assembly are as follows:\n{{Main|Bermudian general election, 2017}}\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Party\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/\u2013\n|-\n|align=left|[[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]]||20,059||58.89||24||+7\n|-\n|align=left|[[One Bermuda Alliance]]||13,832||40.61||12||\u22127\n|-\n|align=left|Independents||169||0.50||0||0\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||UNK||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left|'''Total'''||'''34,060'''||'''100'''||'''36'''||'''0'''\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||46,669||-||\u2013||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left colspan=5|Source: [http://www.elections.gov.bm/ Parliamentary Registry], [http://electionguide.org/results.php?ID=1951 IFES]\n|}\n\n==Judicial branch==\nThe Magistrates' Court is a creature of statute. Its jurisdiction includes: adjudicating on small claims in civil matters, dealing with a number of regulatory applications, trial of summary criminal offences and serving as examining justices on indictable matters (that is, determining if there is sufficient evidence to commit a criminal suspect for trial on indictment in the Supreme Court).\n\nThe Supreme Court has inherent original jurisdiction for most civil matters, with concurrent jurisdiction in common law and equity. The Supreme Court also deals with trials on indictment (that is, the most serious criminal matters). The Supreme Court can judicially review government action in accordance with the principles of [[Administrative Law]] and entertain petitions that laws or public acts are contrary to the Constitution of Bermuda. It also has appellate jurisdiction on matters from the Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction on matters from the Supreme Court.\n\nThe [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court on all matters from Bermuda.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nBermuda has two municipal [[Administrative division|subnational entities]]: the city of Hamilton and the town of St. George.  There are also nine traditional parishes, but these don't have any administrative or legal role.  When Bermuda was first colonised, the territory was divided between eight primary landowners (the shareholders of the Bermuda Company) in equal allotments, and public land (St. George's); these divisions, then called \"Tribes\", came to be known as \"Parishes\".  Until the late 20th century, the parishes maintained their own community councils responsible for such functions as birth records. Today, the Bermuda parishes are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bernews.com/government/parishes-of-bermuda/|title=Parishes of Bermuda Parishes|website=Bernews|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>\n\n# Sandys\n# Southampton\n# Warwick\n# Paget\n# Pembroke\n# Devonshire\n# Smith's\n# Hamilton \n# St. George's\n\n==International organization participation==\n[[Caricom]] (associate), CCC, ICFTU, [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] (subbureau), IOC\n\n==Political conditions==\nBermuda's first political party, the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] (PLP), was formed in February 1963 with predominantly black and working class adherents. Its leadership quickly became dominated by West Indian Bermudians (the 20th century had seen considerable immigration from the West Indies, resulting in profound social and political changes in Bermuda). In 1965, the two-party system was launched with the formation of the [[United Bermuda Party]] (UBP), which had the support of the majority of white voters and of some blacks. A third party, the [[Bermuda Democratic Alliance]] (BDA) (not to be confused with a party of the same name founded in 2009), was formed in the summer of 1967 with a splinter group from the PLP as a nucleus; it disbanded in 1970. It was later replaced by the [[National Liberal Party (Bermuda)|National Liberal Party]] (NLP) which contested elections until 2003 with no success.\n\nBermuda's first election held on the basis of universal adult suffrage and equal voting took place on 22 May 1968; previously, the franchise had been limited to property owners and those above the age of 21. Persons who owned land in one or more parishes could vote in each parish.  In the 1968 election, the UBP won 30 House of Assembly seats, while the PLP won 10 and the BDP lost the three seats it had previously held. The UBP continued to maintain control of the government, although by decreasing margins in the Assembly, until 1998 when the PLP won the general election for the first time with 54% of the popular vote and a 24-seat majority in the 40-member Assembly.

Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A.

At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A.

Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A.

Therefore, a [[Great Coalition]] of parties formed in order to reform the political system.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=44}}\n\n===Influences leading to Confederation===\nSeveral factors influenced Confederation, both caused from internal sources and pressures from external sources.{{sfn|Martin|1995|pp=23-57}}<ref name=\"Martin1990\">{{cite book |first=Ged |last=Martin |title=The Causes of Canadian confederation |pages=[https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 12\u201324] |year=1990 |publisher=Acadiensis Press |isbn=978-0-919107-25-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Smith |title=British Businessmen and Canadian Confederation Constitution-Making in an Era of Anglo-Globalization |location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2008}}</ref>\n;Internal causes that influenced Confederation:\n* political deadlock resulting from the current political structure\n* demographic pressure (population expansion)\n* economic nationalism and the promise of economic development\n* an inter-colony railroad which would improve trade, military movement, and transportation in general <ref>The Intercolonial Railway, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=4</ref>\n\n;External pressures that influenced Confederation:\n* cancellation of the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] (a free trade policy whereby products were allowed into the United States without taxes or tariffs starting in 1854, which was then considered to be beneficial for Canada), in 1865 by the United States, partly as a revenge against Great Britain for unofficial support of the South in the American Civil War\n* the U.S. doctrine of \"[[manifest destiny]]\", the possible threat of invasion from the U.S.\u2014Canadians had fended off American invasions during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812\u2014increased by the [[Alaska Purchase]] of March 30, 1867, which was supported on the floor of the U.S. Senate (by Charles Sumner, among others) precisely in terms of taking over the remainder of North America from the British\n* the [[American Civil War]], which horrified Canadians and drove many away from any thought of republicanism, along with British actions during the war, and American reactions to Canada<ref>The American Dimension, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=3</ref>\n* the [[Fenian raids]]\n* the [[Little Englander]] philosophy, whereby Britain no longer wanted to maintain troops in its colonies.\n* political pressure from British financiers who had invested money in the loss-making [[Grand Trunk Railway]]\n* The [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]\n\n===Ideological origins and philosophical dimensions===\n[[File:Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Confederation 1867.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Canadian Confederation, 1867.]]\nThere is extensive scholarly debate on the role of political ideas in Canadian Confederation. Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

Macdonald]] surprised the Atlantic premiers by asking if the Province of Canada could be included in the negotiations. The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008}} After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]]'s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]'s [[Clear Grits]].{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}} Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald presented arguments in favour of a union of the three colonies;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] presented the Province of Canada's proposals on the financial arrangements of such a union;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} and George Brown presented a proposal for what form a united government might take.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}} The Canadian delegation's proposal for the governmental system involved:\n# preservation of ties with Great Britain;\n# residual jurisdiction left to a central authority;\n# a bicameral system including a Lower House with representation by population (rep by pop) and an Upper House with representation based on regional, rather than provincial, equality;\n# responsible government at the federal and provincial levels;\n# the appointment of a [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian governor general]] by the [[British Crown]].\n\nOther proposals attractive to the politicians from the Maritime colonies were:\n# assumption of provincial debt by the central government;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# revenues from the central government apportioned to the provinces on the basis of population;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# the building of an intercolonial railway to link Montreal and Halifax, giving Canada access to an ice-free winter port and the Maritimes easy access to Canada and [[Rupert's Land]].{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=307}}\n\nBy September 7, 1864, the delegates from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gave a positive answer to the Canadian delegation, expressing the view the federation of all of the provinces was considered desirable if the terms of union could be made satisfactory{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}} and the question of Maritime Union was waived.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}}\n\nAfter the Conference adjourned on September 9, there were further meetings between delegates held at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Fredericton]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=88}}{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}} These meetings evinced enough interest that the delegates decided to hold a second Conference.\n[[File:ThomasDArcyMcGee.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868]]\n\n====Delegates' reactions====\nOne of the most important purposes of the Charlottetown Conference was the introduction of Canadians to the leaders from the Maritime Provinces and vice versa. At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A. Macdonald asked [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Viscount Monck]], the [[Governor-General of the Province of Canada]] to invite delegates from the three Maritime provinces and Newfoundland to a conference with United Canada delegates. Monck obliged and the Conference went ahead at [[Quebec City]] in October 1864.\n\n[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|left|Delegates at the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], October 1864]]\n\nThe Conference began on October 10, 1864, on the site of present-day Montmorency Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |title=Quebec 2008 (400th Anniversary website), Government of Canada |publisher=Quebec400.gc.ca |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011800/http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |archivedate=May 6, 2012}}</ref> The Conference elected [[\u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9]] as its chairman, but it was dominated by Macdonald. Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S. E. Dawson and reprinted in a Quebec City newspaper during the Conference.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nAgain, reaction to the Quebec Conference varied depending on the political views of the critic.\n\n==== Constitutional scheme discussed in London====\nGeorge Brown was the first to carry the constitutional proposals to the British Government in London in December 1864, where it gave \"a most gracious answer to our constitutional scheme.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mackenzie |first=Alexander |title=The Life and Speeches of Hon.

The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.\n\nIn December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[audience (meeting)|audience]],<ref name=\"Lady Carnarvon\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/ |title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day |date=2017-06-30 |work=Lady Carnarvon |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=16}}</ref> At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].\n\nAfter breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the ''[[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]].'' The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A.

July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].\n\nThe form of the country's government was influenced by the American republic to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A.

In addition, USA Baseball selects players for the 14U, 16U and 17U National Team Development Programs.\n\nThe organization is responsible for the continued proliferation and health of the sport, and leads a number of amateur initiatives through its Sport Development department, including Play Ball and Pitch Smart. \u00a0USA Baseball also presents the Golden Spikes Award annually to the top amateur baseball player in the country and is responsible for creating the USABat standard.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Creation ===\nIn 1978, the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] established the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) and provided for national governing bodies to be created for each Olympic sport. Since then, USA Baseball has been the national governing body for amateur baseball. It represents the sport in the United States as a member of the USOC and internationally as a member federation of the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC).\n\nNearly every major national amateur baseball organization in America is united as a USA Baseball national member organization. As a result, USA Baseball governs more than 15.6&nbsp;million amateur players in ballparks and playgrounds across the country. As the commissioner's office for amateur baseball, USA Baseball is a resource center for its various membership groups, fans and players. USA Baseball is also responsible for promoting and developing the game of baseball on the grassroots level, both nationally and internationally.\n\n=== Move to North Carolina ===\nOriginally based in [[New Jersey]], USA Baseball moved to [[Arizona]] in November 1997 where it spent five years before moving one more time to its current home in [[Cary, North Carolina]], in March 2003. With its family friendly environment, already-rapid growth and proximity to such huge sports cities as [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], the town of Cary was the perfect destination for the national governing body of Our Pastime's Future.\n\nAn agreement was reached with the town to create a complex and headquarters there and the USA Baseball National Training Complex opened its doors in June 2007. The first event held at the facility was the 2007 USA Baseball Tournament of Stars, which served as the primary identification event for the organization's 18U National Team from 2007 to 2018.\n[[File:USA Baseball National Training Complex CaryNC.jpg|thumb|USA Baseball National Training Complex|308x308px]]\n\n=== National Training Complex ===\nThe USA Baseball National Training Complex at Thomas Brooks Park in Cary, North Carolina, opened its doors in 2007. Located within the 221-acre Thomas Brooks Park, the National Training Complex includes four baseball fields \u2013 a stadium field and three training fields \u2013 all with dimensions of 330 feet down the lines and 400 feet in centerfield. All fields are maintained at [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) standards.\n\nIn recognition of more than 30 years of public service and countless accomplishments for the citizens of Cary, the Cary Town Council named the stadium field in honor of former Town Manager William B. Coleman, Jr., upon his retirement on October 17, 2008.\n\nColeman Field has a press box that includes two suites, an official scorer's room, a sound room and a press row. Spectator seating is for 1,754 people, including handicapped accessible seating, and additional grass seating for approximately 250 people. All fields have access to restroom facilities and a concession building.\n\nThe National Training Complex is also home to the flagship USA Baseball Team Store, which is open during all USA Baseball events at the complex.\n\n=== 14U and 16U National Teams ===\nFrom 1997\u20132011, USA Baseball fielded a 16U National Team that participated in the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) World Youth Championships, as well as other tournaments, including the [[COPABE]] Pan American Youth Championships and the 1999 PAL World Series.\n\nIn its 15-year history, the USA Baseball 16U National Team experienced unparalleled success on the international stage. Team USA made it to the championship game of every international tournament it appeared in, taking home 11 gold medals \u2013 including nine in World Championships \u2013 and three silvers. In addition, eight of those teams went undefeated in international play. The program holds an overall historical record of 99\u201310 against international opponents, including going 54\u20132 in World Championships.\n\nThe 14U National Team was created in 2007 and fielded teams for the COPABE Pan American Championships and Pan American Championships Qualifiers until 2011. In that time, the program went undefeated five times in six international tournaments, earning five gold medals and one bronze in its history and finishing with a 39\u20132 overall record.\n\nIn 2011, the two teams were discontinued after the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) changed its youth championships age discipline to 15U. The programs were replaced with the 15U National Team and the 14U National Team Development Program.\n\n=== USA Baseball in the Olympic Games ===\nBaseball was first introduced to the [[Olympic Games]] as an exhibition sport at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles 1984 Games]] and returned as a demonstration sport in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul 1988 Games]]. In 1984, the United States came in second, falling to Japan in the final, 6\u20133. Four years later though, Team USA got Olympic redemption as it won the gold medal over Japan with a 5\u20133 victory.\n\nBaseball became an official [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] sport with its addition to the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona 1992 Games]] program. The tournament consisted of eight teams and featured a round-robin format in which each team played each other before advancing to the semi-final and final rounds. The USA Baseball Collegiate National Team represented the U.S. in the games from 1992 until 2000, as all athletes were required to be amateurs during that time. Team USA did not place in the 1992 games but won bronze on home soil during the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta 1996 Games]].\n\nUSA Baseball started using professional-level athletes for the first time in 1999 with the 2000 Olympic Team being one of the first Professional National Teams to represent the U.S. in international competition. Led by Manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] and featuring players like [[Ben Sheets]], [[Ernie Young]] and [[Brad Wilkerson]], Team USA went 8\u20131 in the tournament en route to the Olympic gold medal. The 2000 Olympic Team was later named the [[USOC Team of the Year]].\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004 Games]], the U.S. returned to the Olympics in 2008, finishing with a 6\u20133 record and claiming the bronze medal with an 8\u20134 defeat of Japan.\n\nBaseball was voted out of the Olympic program for the 2012 and 2016 games, but on August 3, 2016, the [[International Olympic Committee]] approved the reinstatement of the sport for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.\n\n==National Teams==\n\n\n===Professional National Team===\nSince 1999, USA Baseball has been selecting teams of professional-level [[Minor League Baseball|Minor]] and [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] players to represent the United States in various international competitions, including the [[World Baseball Classic]].\n\nThe very first Professional National Team that the organization selected participated in the [[1999 Pan American Games]] in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Canada]]. The team went 5\u20132 in the tournament, eventually making it to the gold medal game where it fell to [[Cuba]] 5\u20131 to claim the silver medal.\n\nAlso among the first teams of professional players that USA Baseball fielded was the [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 U.S. Olympic Baseball Team]], managed by [[Tommy Lasorda]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Behind a stellar performance on the mound by [[Ben Sheets]], the team of Minor League players defeated Cuba for the gold medal. In 2008, a [[Davey Johnson]]-led U.S. team featuring [[Dexter Fowler]], [[Matt LaPorta]] and [[Stephen Strasburg]] took home the bronze medal from the Beijing Games, which currently stands as the last Olympic Games featuring a baseball competition.\n\nIn 2011, USA Baseball fielded one team of professional Minor League players to compete in both the World Cup and Pan American Games. The Pan American team posted a 10\u20136 record and took home the silver medal from [[Lagos de Moreno|Lagos de Moreno, Mexico]]. [[Joe Thurston]] and [[Brett Jackson]] led the team offensively, and [[Andy Van Hekken]] and [[Drew Smyly]] contributed strong pitching performances.\n\nThe World Cup Team was named co-bronze medalist of the [[Baseball World Cup|IBAF Baseball World Cup]], which was played in [[Panama]]. The U.S. shared the honor with Canada after their bronze-medal game was rained out.\n\nIn 2015, USA Baseball fielded two Professional National Teams, once again made up of Minor League players, for the [[2015 Pan American Games|Toronto 2015 Pan American Games]] and the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) [[WBSC Premier12|Premier12]]. The U.S. claimed the silver medal in both events. The Pan American Games roster featured players like [[Albert Almora|Albert Almora, Jr.]], [[Tyler Pastornicky]], [[Paul Sewald]] and [[Zach Eflin]], while the Premier12 team was led by [[Matt McBride]], [[Adam Frazier]] and [[Anthony Vasquez (baseball)|Anthony Vasquez]]. \n\nUSA Baseball will once again field a Professional National Team in 2019 for the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation|WBSC]] [[WBSC Premier12|Premier12]].

Subsequently, the tournament was created and the first installment was played in 2006. Unique to the event is the use of Major League players on the rosters, marking the first team in USA Baseball history to feature MLB-level athletes.\n\nFor the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic, Team USA featured such stars as [[Chase Utley]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Chipper Jones]]. In the second installment of the WBC in 2009, with players like [[Dustin Pedroia]], [[Jimmy Rollins]] and Jeter donning the red, white and blue, the U.S. team finished fourth, losing to Japan in the semi-finals.\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic Team was managed by [[Joe Torre]] and led by the likes of [[David Wright]], [[Joe Mauer]] and Rollins. Team USA advanced to the second round of the tournament before falling to [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nMost recently, Team USA had its best showing in the tournament so far, taking home the 2017 World Baseball Classic gold medal. Managed by [[Jim Leyland]] and featuring players like [[Marcus Stroman]], [[Christian Yelich]], [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], [[Eric Hosmer]], [[Buster Posey]] and [[Brandon Crawford]], the U.S. went 6\u20132 en route to the title. The team opened the tournament with a dramatic 3\u20132 walk-off victory in extra innings over [[Colombia]] and took down the defending champions [[Dominican Republic]] \u2013 with the help of an iconic catch from Jones that robbed [[Manny Machado]] of a home run \u2013 in the second round to advance to the semi-finals.\n\nFollowing a rain-soaked 2\u20131 victory over Japan, Team USA went head-to-head against Puerto Rico \u2013 which had beaten the U.S. 6\u20135 earlier in the tournament \u2013 in the final and put together a dominating 8\u20130 win. Stroman got the start and took a no-hitter into the seventh inning of the contest, giving up just one hit and one walk in his six innings of work. The offense backed up Stroman's stellar outing with a 13-hit showing that led to 8 runs, five of which came with two outs, to secure the shutout victory and USA Baseball's first-ever World Baseball Classic championship.\n\nStroman was named the MVP of the tournament, while Hosmer (1B) and Yelich (OF) were both named to the World Baseball Classic All-Tournament Team.<ref name=\"WBC\">{{cite web |title=About |url=https://www.worldbaseballclassic.com/info/about |website=worldbaseballclassic.com |accessdate=January 26, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n'''ALL-TIME TEAM USA WORLD BASEBALL CLASSIC RESULTS:'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2006 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/7/06\n|Mexico\n|2\u20130 (W)\n|-\n|3/8/06\n|Canada\n|8\u20136 (W)\n|-\n|3/10/06\n|South Africa\n|17\u20130 (W)\n|-\n|3/12/06\n|Japan\n|4\u20133 (W)\n|-\n|3/13/06\n|Korea\n|7\u20133 (L)\n|-\n|3/16/06\n|Mexico\n|2\u20131 (L)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2009 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/7/09\n|Canada\n|6\u20135 (W)\n|-\n|5/8/09\n|Venezuela\n|15\u20136 (W)\n|-\n|3/11/09\n|Venezuela\n|5\u20133 (L)\n|-\n|3/14/09\n|Puerto Rico\n|11\u20131 (L)\n|-\n|3/15/09\n|Netherlands\n|9\u20133 (W)\n|-\n|3/17/09\n|Puerto Rico\n|6\u20135 (W)\n|-\n|3/18/09\n|Venezuela\n|10\u20136 (L)\n|-\n|3/22/09\n|Japan\n|9\u20134 (L)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2013 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/8/13\n|Mexico\n|5\u20132 (L)\n|-\n|3/9/13\n|Italy\n|6\u20132 (W)\n|-\n|3/10/13\n|Canada\n|9\u20134 (W)\n|-\n|3/12/13\n|Puerto Rico\n|7\u20131 (W)\n|-\n|3/14/13\n|Dominican Republic\n|3\u20131 (L)\n|-\n|3/15/13\n|Puerto Rico\n|4\u20133 (L)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2017 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/10/17\n|Colombia\n|3\u20132, 10 innings (W)\n|-\n|3/11/17\n|Dominican Republic\n|7\u20135 (L)\n|-\n|3/12/17\n|Canada\n|8\u20130 (W)\n|-\n|3/15/17\n|Venezuela\n|4\u20132 (W)\n|-\n|3/17/17\n|Puerto Rico\n|6\u20135 (L)\n|-\n|3/18/17\n|Dominican Republic\n|6\u20133 (W)\n|-\n|3/21/17\n|Japan\n|2\u20131 (W)\n|-\n|3/22/17\n|Puerto Rico (Championship Game)\n|8\u20130 (W)\n|}\n\n\n===Collegiate National Team===\nThe USA Baseball Collegiate National Team is composed of the top non-draft eligible collegiate baseball players in the country. The team competes each summer in a schedule of exhibition games across the U.S. and overseas against the world's top baseball talent. As part of this schedule, the U.S. takes on the [[Japan national baseball team|Japan Collegiate All-Stars]] nearly every summer and squares off in international friendship series against the likes of Canada, Chinese Taipei, Cuba and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Collegiate program has witnessed great success in recent years. In 2009, the U.S. won the inaugural [[World Baseball Challenge]] in Canada, and the 2011 team posted an 11\u20132\u20131 record, defeating Japan in four out of five games during their international friendship series.\n\nIn 2013, the USA-Cuba international friendships series returned to the U.S. for the first time since 1996, with Team USA putting together a historic five-game sweep of the Cuban National Team. The Collegiate National Team also traveled abroad to compete in the 39th annual USA vs. Japan Collegiate All-Star Series, where the host nation claimed a 3\u20132 series victory.\n\nThe 2014 Collegiate National Team also enjoyed success in its summer tour, finishing with an 18\u20138\u20132 record, including going 7\u20131 in the [[Haarlem Baseball Week|XXVIII Haarlem Baseball Week]] tournament. In 2016, Team USA traveled to Cuba for the fifth installment of the USA vs. Cuba International Friendship Series. For the first time in USA Baseball history, the Collegiate National Team claimed a series against Cuba on Cuban soil, courtesy of a [[Keston Hiura]]-pinch hit home run in the final game of the series that secured a 2\u20131 defeat of the home country and a 3\u20132 series victory.\n\nIn 2017, the Collegiate National Team contributed to USA Baseball's historic sweep of international competition with series wins over all three of its international opponents that year, including [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team|Chinese Taipei]], Cuba and Japan. The 2018 Collegiate National Team then followed that with another sweep, once again collecting series wins over Chinese Taipei, Cuba and Japan. The program followed its 2017 success with another strong showing in 2018, once again sweeping its three international series against Chinese Taipei, Japan and Cuba and finishing with a 11-3 record in international play. The series win against Cuba was just the second time in USA Baseball history that the Collegiate National Team has won a series against Cuba on Cuban soil with the first coming 2016.\n\nPlayers who have taken the field for the Collegiate National Team and have gone on to have successful Major League Baseball careers include such notables as [[Jim Abbott]], [[Alex Bregman]], [[Kris Bryant]], [[Troy Glaus]], [[Todd Helton]], [[Ryan Howard]], [[Barry Larkin]], [[Tino Martinez]], Pedroia, [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]], [[Huston Street]], [[Dansby Swanson]], [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Troy Tulowitzki]], [[Jason Varitek]] and [[Ryan Zimmerman]].<ref name=\"USAB-ColNat\">{{cite web |title=Collegiate National Team Home |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/collegiate-national-team |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Collegiate National Team Gold Medals<ref name=\"USAB-ColNatHist\">{{cite web |title=Collegiate National Team History |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/collegiate-national-team/history |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n!Year\n!Tournament\n|-\n|2014\n|XXVIII Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|2009\n|World Baseball Challenge\n|-\n|2008\n|XXV Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|2008\n|IV FISU World University Games\n|-\n|2006\n|FISU World University Championships\n|-\n|2004\n|FISU World University Championships\n|-\n|2002\n|XXII Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|2000\n|XXI Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|1995\n|National Baseball Congress World Series\n|-\n|1988\n|Seoul 1988 Olympic Games\n|-\n|1974\n|XXIII Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|1973\n|XXII Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|1967\n|V Pan American Games\n|}\n\n===18U National Team===\nComposed of the nation's top players ages 16 to 18, the USA Baseball 18U National Team is a perennial power on the international baseball scene. The team competes in two major events in bi-yearly cycles \u2013 the COPABE Pan American \u201cAAA\u201d Championships and the [[U-18 Baseball World Cup|World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) U-18 Baseball World Cup]]. The 18U team will be looking for its fifth consecutive Pan Am Championships gold medal in 2018. The program has won seven straight international tournament titles dating back to 2011, including winning the last four WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cups in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the 18U National Team finished off USA Baseball's unprecedented sweep of international competition with a dominant showing in the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup. The team went undefeated for just the second time in the program's history, and the first since 1989, while the pitching staff tallied an incredible 0.47 collective [[Earned run average|ERA]] en route to the gold medal.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the 18U National Team finished a stellar USA Baseball season on a high note. The team traveled to Panama for the 2018 COPABE U-18 Pan-American Championships in November and dominated to claim its fifth Pan-American Championships gold medal in a row and its eighth straight gold medal in international competition dating back to 2011. The team had a historic run en route to the title, outscoring its opponents 131-27 in nine games while going undefeated. The 131 runs scored is the most an 18U National Team has ever scored in international competition.\n\nCurrent Major Leaguers [[Matt Holliday]], [[Bryce Harper]], [[Clayton Kershaw]], [[Buster Posey]], [[Eric Hosmer]], [[Freddie Freeman]] and [[Justin Upton]] have all worn the USA jersey as 18U players.<ref name=\"USAB-18U\">{{cite web |title=18U National Team Home |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/18u |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+National Team Gold Medals<ref name=\"USAB-18UHist\">{{cite web |title=18U National Team History |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/18u/history |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n!Year\n!Tournament\n|-\n|2018\n|COPABE U-18 Pan-American Championships\n|-\n|2017\n|WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|2016\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|2015\n|WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|2014\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|2013\n|IBAF \"AAA\" World Cup\n|-\n|2012\n|IBAF \"AAA\" World Cup\n|-\n|2011\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|2009\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|1999\n|IBA Junior World Cup\n|-\n|1995\n|Junior World Championships\n|-\n|1989\n|World Youth Baseball Championships\n|-\n|1988\n|World Youth Baseball Championships\n|}\n\n===15U National Team===\nIn 2012, USA Baseball rolled out its first-ever 15U National Team. The program, which is composed of some of the most talented young players across the county, played four games in the [[Dominican Republic]] against the Dominicans and [[Puerto Rico]]. Team USA went 4\u20130 abroad, outscoring their opponents, 31\u20133.\n\nIn 2013, the 15U National Team traveled to [[Barranquilla|Baranquilla, Colombia]], for the COPABE Pan American \"AA\" Championships, where it brought home the gold medal for the first time. En route to defeating Cuba, 6\u20131, in the championship game, the 15U squad amassed a perfect record, finishing 8\u20130 in the event.\n\nCompeting in its first World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) [[U-15 Baseball World Cup]] in 2014, Team USA traveled to [[Mazatl\u00e1n|Mazatlan, Mexico]], and went 9\u20131 overall and claimed the silver medal. The 2014 campaign also saw the 15U National Team's [[Brice Turang]] bring home the 15U's first-ever USA Baseball Richard W. \"Dick\" Case Player of the Year Award. The award is given to the athlete who is not only an outstanding player on the field, but also exemplified sportsmanship and love of the game. The full list of winners can be found here.\n\nUSA Baseball's National Team Championships, 14U National Team Development Program (NTDP) and National Team Identification Series (NTIS) help the organization identify players for the 15U National Team. The National Team Championships are held in Arizona and Florida and up to 72 teams compete in each region. USA Baseball representatives and scouts select the top players from each event to make up the National Team.\n\nStarting in 2017, a new trials system was introduced for the 15U program that includes two phases and 72 athletes vying for just 20 spots on Team USA's roster. The pool of talent is then narrowed to 34 players for Phase 2 before the final 20 are named.\n\nFollowing 2018 trials and training at the National Training Complex in Cary, North Carolina, the 15U National Team traveled to [[David, Chiriqu\u00ed|David, Panama]], where it claimed the program's first-ever WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup gold medal.<ref name=\"USAB-15U\">{{cite web |title=15U National Team Home |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/15u |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+15U National Team Gold Medals<ref name=\"USAB-15UHist\">{{cite web |title=15U National Team History |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/15u/history |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n!Year\n!Tournament\n|-\n|2018\n|WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|2017\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|-\n|2015\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|-\n|2013\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|-\n|2012\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|}\n\n===12U National Team===\nIn 2013, USA Baseball launched its first-ever 12U National Team. The team, which was composed of some of the most talented young players from across the county, traveled to [[Taipei|Taipei City, Taiwan]], and came home with its first International Baseball Federation (IBAF) [[U-12 Baseball World Cup|12U World Cup]] gold medal. After lengthy pool play, the 12U National Team defeated the host, Chinese Taipei, in the World Cup final, 8\u20131. The game was attended by over 10,000 home fans and was broadcast throughout parts of Asia and online.\n\nThe 12U National Team is composed of players selected from the USA Baseball National Team Identification Series (NTIS), the 12U National Open through the 12U Open Development Camps and the 11U Futures Invitational.\n\nIn 2015, the 12U National Team claimed its second world championship in a row with a 7\u20132 win over Chinese Taipei in the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) [[U-12 Baseball World Cup]]. The program then followed that with a silver medal at the 2016 COPABE Pan American \"A\" Championships. A third consecutive gold medal in the WBSC U-12 Baseball World Cup in 2017 with another 7\u20132 defeat of Chinese Taipei marked the team's contribution to USA Baseball's 2017 sweep of international competition.\n\nThe 12U National Team returned to the COPABE U-12 Pan American Championships in 2018 where it claimed its first-ever gold medal in the event.

Team USA repeated as [[International Baseball Federation|IBAF]] World Cup gold medalists in 2006 in Taiwan, before taking home the bronze medal at the 2008 World Cup in Japan and again in 2010 in Venezuela.\n\nIn 2012 and 2014, the Women's National Team won the silver medal at the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) Women's Baseball World Cup in Edmonton, Canada, and [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki, Japan]], respectively. The 2015 Women's National Team competed in the [[2015 Pan American Games|Toronto 2015 Pan American Games]] and claimed gold, defeating Canada 11\u20133 to earn the championship.\n\nWhen not competing in international tournaments, the Women's National Team hosts a Women's National Team Development Program, leads youth clinics and works to grow the game of baseball among women in the U.S.\n\nThe 2018 Women's National Team was named following the Women's National Open and Women's National Team Trials in June of this year. The 20-woman team competes in the 2018 WBSC Women's Baseball World Cup, which was held in the U.S. for the first time, from August 22\u201331 at the USSSA Space Coast Complex in Viera, Florida.

It also serves to help young players accelerate their maturation and readiness for the next step in their respective baseball careers.\n\nSince the program's inception in 2012, 64 national team development program attendees have earned spots on national team rosters at the 15U, 18U and Collegiate National Team levels. Additionally, in the five years that NTDP participants have been eligible, 21 players have been selected in the first five rounds of the [[Major League Baseball draft|MLB First-Year Player Draft]].\n\n===17U National Team Development Program===\nIn 2012, USA Baseball fielded its first ever 17U National Team Development Program.

As no event currently brings in a level of talent from top to bottom that the NHSI promises, the eventual tournament champion will kick off their respective season with recognition as the top high school baseball team in the country.\n\nThe NHSI, which not only features the top teams in the country, but also some of the best amateur baseball players, is a 16-team, single-elimination championship tournament. Each participating team is guaranteed to play four games.

At its inception, the event was a tournament for 16-and-under travel baseball teams that was used to identify talent for the USA Baseball 16U National Team.\n\nWhen USA Baseball moved from [[New Jersey]] to [[Arizona]] in 1998, the then-56 team tournament moved out west as well, where it was contested at the [[Spring training|Spring Training]] homes of the [[Colorado Rockies]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]]/[[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. With the popularity and size of the event growing exponentially, it was expanded to a second location in 2001, once again including the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] with a location in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers, Fla]].\n\nIn 2009, the tournament was renamed and expanded once more, this time to include a second age group. Now called the National Team Championships, a 14U division was added to identify talent for the USA Baseball 14U National Team. However, when the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) changed its international competition age groups from 16U to 15U in 2012, a 15U division was added to the National Team Championships for the new 15U National Team, the 16U division was changed to 17U and the 17U and 14U divisions now funneled into the newly-created National Team Development Programs.\n\nThrough this event \u2013 which is still held annually in both Arizona and Florida \u2013 USA Baseball provides an opportunity for 400+ teams to showcase their ability against teams from all across the country.\n\nIn Florida, the USA Baseball National Team Championships are held in [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], at [[Roger Dean Stadium]], the Spring Training home of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Miami Marlins]], and [[FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches|The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches]], the Spring Training home of the 2017 World Series Champions [[Houston Astros]] and the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\nIn Arizona, the USA Baseball National Team Championships are held in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] and [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]], Arizona, at the Spring Training homes of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\n\n\n===Futures Invitational===\nThe USA Baseball 10U and 11U Futures Invitational are elite, invite-only youth championship events, exclusively reserved for top 10U and 11U teams and athletes.

In addition, USA Baseball selects players for the 14U, 16U and 17U National Team Development Programs.\n\nThe organization is responsible for the continued proliferation and health of the sport, and leads a number of amateur initiatives through its Sport Development department, including Play Ball and Pitch Smart. \u00a0USA Baseball also presents the Golden Spikes Award annually to the top amateur baseball player in the country and is responsible for creating the USABat standard.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Creation ===\nIn 1978, the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] established the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) and provided for national governing bodies to be created for each Olympic sport. Since then, USA Baseball has been the national governing body for amateur baseball. It represents the sport in the United States as a member of the USOC and internationally as a member federation of the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC).\n\nNearly every major national amateur baseball organization in America is united as a USA Baseball national member organization. As a result, USA Baseball governs more than 15.6&nbsp;million amateur players in ballparks and playgrounds across the country. As the commissioner's office for amateur baseball, USA Baseball is a resource center for its various membership groups, fans and players. USA Baseball is also responsible for promoting and developing the game of baseball on the grassroots level, both nationally and internationally.\n\n=== Move to North Carolina ===\nOriginally based in [[New Jersey]], USA Baseball moved to [[Arizona]] in November 1997 where it spent five years before moving one more time to its current home in [[Cary, North Carolina]], in March 2003. With its family friendly environment, already-rapid growth and proximity to such huge sports cities as [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], the town of Cary was the perfect destination for the national governing body of Our Pastime's Future.\n\nAn agreement was reached with the town to create a complex and headquarters there and the USA Baseball National Training Complex opened its doors in June 2007. The first event held at the facility was the 2007 USA Baseball Tournament of Stars, which served as the primary identification event for the organization's 18U National Team from 2007 to 2018.\n[[File:USA Baseball National Training Complex CaryNC.jpg|thumb|USA Baseball National Training Complex|308x308px]]\n\n=== National Training Complex ===\nThe USA Baseball National Training Complex at Thomas Brooks Park in Cary, North Carolina, opened its doors in 2007. Located within the 221-acre Thomas Brooks Park, the National Training Complex includes four baseball fields \u2013 a stadium field and three training fields \u2013 all with dimensions of 330 feet down the lines and 400 feet in centerfield. All fields are maintained at [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) standards.\n\nIn recognition of more than 30 years of public service and countless accomplishments for the citizens of Cary, the Cary Town Council named the stadium field in honor of former Town Manager William B. Coleman, Jr., upon his retirement on October 17, 2008.\n\nColeman Field has a press box that includes two suites, an official scorer's room, a sound room and a press row. Spectator seating is for 1,754 people, including handicapped accessible seating, and additional grass seating for approximately 250 people. All fields have access to restroom facilities and a concession building.\n\nThe National Training Complex is also home to the flagship USA Baseball Team Store, which is open during all USA Baseball events at the complex.\n\n=== 14U and 16U National Teams ===\nFrom 1997\u20132011, USA Baseball fielded a 16U National Team that participated in the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) World Youth Championships, as well as other tournaments, including the [[COPABE]] Pan American Youth Championships and the 1999 PAL World Series.\n\nIn its 15-year history, the USA Baseball 16U National Team experienced unparalleled success on the international stage. Team USA made it to the championship game of every international tournament it appeared in, taking home 11 gold medals \u2013 including nine in World Championships \u2013 and three silvers. In addition, eight of those teams went undefeated in international play. The program holds an overall historical record of 99\u201310 against international opponents, including going 54\u20132 in World Championships.\n\nThe 14U National Team was created in 2007 and fielded teams for the COPABE Pan American Championships and Pan American Championships Qualifiers until 2011. In that time, the program went undefeated five times in six international tournaments, earning five gold medals and one bronze in its history and finishing with a 39\u20132 overall record.\n\nIn 2011, the two teams were discontinued after the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) changed its youth championships age discipline to 15U. The programs were replaced with the 15U National Team and the 14U National Team Development Program.\n\n=== USA Baseball in the Olympic Games ===\nBaseball was first introduced to the [[Olympic Games]] as an exhibition sport at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles 1984 Games]] and returned as a demonstration sport in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul 1988 Games]]. In 1984, the United States came in second, falling to Japan in the final, 6\u20133. Four years later though, Team USA got Olympic redemption as it won the gold medal over Japan with a 5\u20133 victory.\n\nBaseball became an official [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] sport with its addition to the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona 1992 Games]] program. The tournament consisted of eight teams and featured a round-robin format in which each team played each other before advancing to the semi-final and final rounds. The USA Baseball Collegiate National Team represented the U.S. in the games from 1992 until 2000, as all athletes were required to be amateurs during that time. Team USA did not place in the 1992 games but won bronze on home soil during the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta 1996 Games]].\n\nUSA Baseball started using professional-level athletes for the first time in 1999 with the 2000 Olympic Team being one of the first Professional National Teams to represent the U.S. in international competition. Led by Manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] and featuring players like [[Ben Sheets]], [[Ernie Young]] and [[Brad Wilkerson]], Team USA went 8\u20131 in the tournament en route to the Olympic gold medal. The 2000 Olympic Team was later named the [[USOC Team of the Year]].\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004 Games]], the U.S. returned to the Olympics in 2008, finishing with a 6\u20133 record and claiming the bronze medal with an 8\u20134 defeat of Japan.\n\nBaseball was voted out of the Olympic program for the 2012 and 2016 games, but on August 3, 2016, the [[International Olympic Committee]] approved the reinstatement of the sport for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.\n\n==National Teams==\n\n\n===Professional National Team===\nSince 1999, USA Baseball has been selecting teams of professional-level [[Minor League Baseball|Minor]] and [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] players to represent the United States in various international competitions, including the [[World Baseball Classic]].\n\nThe very first Professional National Team that the organization selected participated in the [[1999 Pan American Games]] in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Canada]]. The team went 5\u20132 in the tournament, eventually making it to the gold medal game where it fell to [[Cuba]] 5\u20131 to claim the silver medal.\n\nAlso among the first teams of professional players that USA Baseball fielded was the [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 U.S. Olympic Baseball Team]], managed by [[Tommy Lasorda]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Behind a stellar performance on the mound by [[Ben Sheets]], the team of Minor League players defeated Cuba for the gold medal. In 2008, a [[Davey Johnson]]-led U.S. team featuring [[Dexter Fowler]], [[Matt LaPorta]] and [[Stephen Strasburg]] took home the bronze medal from the Beijing Games, which currently stands as the last Olympic Games featuring a baseball competition.\n\nIn 2011, USA Baseball fielded one team of professional Minor League players to compete in both the World Cup and Pan American Games. The Pan American team posted a 10\u20136 record and took home the silver medal from [[Lagos de Moreno|Lagos de Moreno, Mexico]]. [[Joe Thurston]] and [[Brett Jackson]] led the team offensively, and [[Andy Van Hekken]] and [[Drew Smyly]] contributed strong pitching performances.\n\nThe World Cup Team was named co-bronze medalist of the [[Baseball World Cup|IBAF Baseball World Cup]], which was played in [[Panama]]. The U.S. shared the honor with Canada after their bronze-medal game was rained out.\n\nIn 2015, USA Baseball fielded two Professional National Teams, once again made up of Minor League players, for the [[2015 Pan American Games|Toronto 2015 Pan American Games]] and the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) [[WBSC Premier12|Premier12]]. The U.S. claimed the silver medal in both events. The Pan American Games roster featured players like [[Albert Almora|Albert Almora, Jr.]], [[Tyler Pastornicky]], [[Paul Sewald]] and [[Zach Eflin]], while the Premier12 team was led by [[Matt McBride]], [[Adam Frazier]] and [[Anthony Vasquez (baseball)|Anthony Vasquez]]. \n\nUSA Baseball will once again field a Professional National Team in 2019 for the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation|WBSC]] [[WBSC Premier12|Premier12]].

Subsequently, the tournament was created and the first installment was played in 2006. Unique to the event is the use of Major League players on the rosters, marking the first team in USA Baseball history to feature MLB-level athletes.\n\nFor the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic, Team USA featured such stars as [[Chase Utley]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Chipper Jones]]. In the second installment of the WBC in 2009, with players like [[Dustin Pedroia]], [[Jimmy Rollins]] and Jeter donning the red, white and blue, the U.S. team finished fourth, losing to Japan in the semi-finals.\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic Team was managed by [[Joe Torre]] and led by the likes of [[David Wright]], [[Joe Mauer]] and Rollins. Team USA advanced to the second round of the tournament before falling to [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nMost recently, Team USA had its best showing in the tournament so far, taking home the 2017 World Baseball Classic gold medal. Managed by [[Jim Leyland]] and featuring players like [[Marcus Stroman]], [[Christian Yelich]], [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], [[Eric Hosmer]], [[Buster Posey]] and [[Brandon Crawford]], the U.S. went 6\u20132 en route to the title. The team opened the tournament with a dramatic 3\u20132 walk-off victory in extra innings over [[Colombia]] and took down the defending champions [[Dominican Republic]] \u2013 with the help of an iconic catch from Jones that robbed [[Manny Machado]] of a home run \u2013 in the second round to advance to the semi-finals.\n\nFollowing a rain-soaked 2\u20131 victory over Japan, Team USA went head-to-head against Puerto Rico \u2013 which had beaten the U.S. 6\u20135 earlier in the tournament \u2013 in the final and put together a dominating 8\u20130 win. Stroman got the start and took a no-hitter into the seventh inning of the contest, giving up just one hit and one walk in his six innings of work. The offense backed up Stroman's stellar outing with a 13-hit showing that led to 8 runs, five of which came with two outs, to secure the shutout victory and USA Baseball's first-ever World Baseball Classic championship.\n\nStroman was named the MVP of the tournament, while Hosmer (1B) and Yelich (OF) were both named to the World Baseball Classic All-Tournament Team.<ref name=\"WBC\">{{cite web |title=About |url=https://www.worldbaseballclassic.com/info/about |website=worldbaseballclassic.com |accessdate=January 26, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n'''ALL-TIME TEAM USA WORLD BASEBALL CLASSIC RESULTS:'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2006 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/7/06\n|Mexico\n|2\u20130 (W)\n|-\n|3/8/06\n|Canada\n|8\u20136 (W)\n|-\n|3/10/06\n|South Africa\n|17\u20130 (W)\n|-\n|3/12/06\n|Japan\n|4\u20133 (W)\n|-\n|3/13/06\n|Korea\n|7\u20133 (L)\n|-\n|3/16/06\n|Mexico\n|2\u20131 (L)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2009 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/7/09\n|Canada\n|6\u20135 (W)\n|-\n|5/8/09\n|Venezuela\n|15\u20136 (W)\n|-\n|3/11/09\n|Venezuela\n|5\u20133 (L)\n|-\n|3/14/09\n|Puerto Rico\n|11\u20131 (L)\n|-\n|3/15/09\n|Netherlands\n|9\u20133 (W)\n|-\n|3/17/09\n|Puerto Rico\n|6\u20135 (W)\n|-\n|3/18/09\n|Venezuela\n|10\u20136 (L)\n|-\n|3/22/09\n|Japan\n|9\u20134 (L)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2013 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/8/13\n|Mexico\n|5\u20132 (L)\n|-\n|3/9/13\n|Italy\n|6\u20132 (W)\n|-\n|3/10/13\n|Canada\n|9\u20134 (W)\n|-\n|3/12/13\n|Puerto Rico\n|7\u20131 (W)\n|-\n|3/14/13\n|Dominican Republic\n|3\u20131 (L)\n|-\n|3/15/13\n|Puerto Rico\n|4\u20133 (L)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2017 World Baseball Classic\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Score (Result)\n|-\n|3/10/17\n|Colombia\n|3\u20132, 10 innings (W)\n|-\n|3/11/17\n|Dominican Republic\n|7\u20135 (L)\n|-\n|3/12/17\n|Canada\n|8\u20130 (W)\n|-\n|3/15/17\n|Venezuela\n|4\u20132 (W)\n|-\n|3/17/17\n|Puerto Rico\n|6\u20135 (L)\n|-\n|3/18/17\n|Dominican Republic\n|6\u20133 (W)\n|-\n|3/21/17\n|Japan\n|2\u20131 (W)\n|-\n|3/22/17\n|Puerto Rico (Championship Game)\n|8\u20130 (W)\n|}\n\n\n===Collegiate National Team===\nThe USA Baseball Collegiate National Team is composed of the top non-draft eligible collegiate baseball players in the country. The team competes each summer in a schedule of exhibition games across the U.S. and overseas against the world's top baseball talent. As part of this schedule, the U.S. takes on the [[Japan national baseball team|Japan Collegiate All-Stars]] nearly every summer and squares off in international friendship series against the likes of Canada, Chinese Taipei, Cuba and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Collegiate program has witnessed great success in recent years. In 2009, the U.S. won the inaugural [[World Baseball Challenge]] in Canada, and the 2011 team posted an 11\u20132\u20131 record, defeating Japan in four out of five games during their international friendship series.\n\nIn 2013, the USA-Cuba international friendships series returned to the U.S. for the first time since 1996, with Team USA putting together a historic five-game sweep of the Cuban National Team. The Collegiate National Team also traveled abroad to compete in the 39th annual USA vs. Japan Collegiate All-Star Series, where the host nation claimed a 3\u20132 series victory.\n\nThe 2014 Collegiate National Team also enjoyed success in its summer tour, finishing with an 18\u20138\u20132 record, including going 7\u20131 in the [[Haarlem Baseball Week|XXVIII Haarlem Baseball Week]] tournament. In 2016, Team USA traveled to Cuba for the fifth installment of the USA vs. Cuba International Friendship Series. For the first time in USA Baseball history, the Collegiate National Team claimed a series against Cuba on Cuban soil, courtesy of a [[Keston Hiura]]-pinch hit home run in the final game of the series that secured a 2\u20131 defeat of the home country and a 3\u20132 series victory.\n\nIn 2017, the Collegiate National Team contributed to USA Baseball's historic sweep of international competition with series wins over all three of its international opponents that year, including [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team|Chinese Taipei]], Cuba and Japan. The 2018 Collegiate National Team then followed that with another sweep, once again collecting series wins over Chinese Taipei, Cuba and Japan. The program followed its 2017 success with another strong showing in 2018, once again sweeping its three international series against Chinese Taipei, Japan and Cuba and finishing with a 11-3 record in international play. The series win against Cuba was just the second time in USA Baseball history that the Collegiate National Team has won a series against Cuba on Cuban soil with the first coming 2016.\n\nPlayers who have taken the field for the Collegiate National Team and have gone on to have successful Major League Baseball careers include such notables as [[Jim Abbott]], [[Alex Bregman]], [[Kris Bryant]], [[Troy Glaus]], [[Todd Helton]], [[Ryan Howard]], [[Barry Larkin]], [[Tino Martinez]], Pedroia, [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]], [[Huston Street]], [[Dansby Swanson]], [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Troy Tulowitzki]], [[Jason Varitek]] and [[Ryan Zimmerman]].<ref name=\"USAB-ColNat\">{{cite web |title=Collegiate National Team Home |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/collegiate-national-team |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Collegiate National Team Gold Medals<ref name=\"USAB-ColNatHist\">{{cite web |title=Collegiate National Team History |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/collegiate-national-team/history |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n!Year\n!Tournament\n|-\n|2014\n|XXVIII Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|2009\n|World Baseball Challenge\n|-\n|2008\n|XXV Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|2008\n|IV FISU World University Games\n|-\n|2006\n|FISU World University Championships\n|-\n|2004\n|FISU World University Championships\n|-\n|2002\n|XXII Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|2000\n|XXI Haarlem Baseball Week\n|-\n|1995\n|National Baseball Congress World Series\n|-\n|1988\n|Seoul 1988 Olympic Games\n|-\n|1974\n|XXIII Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|1973\n|XXII Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|1967\n|V Pan American Games\n|}\n\n===18U National Team===\nComposed of the nation's top players ages 16 to 18, the USA Baseball 18U National Team is a perennial power on the international baseball scene. The team competes in two major events in bi-yearly cycles \u2013 the COPABE Pan American \u201cAAA\u201d Championships and the [[U-18 Baseball World Cup|World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) U-18 Baseball World Cup]]. The 18U team will be looking for its fifth consecutive Pan Am Championships gold medal in 2018. The program has won seven straight international tournament titles dating back to 2011, including winning the last four WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cups in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the 18U National Team finished off USA Baseball's unprecedented sweep of international competition with a dominant showing in the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup. The team went undefeated for just the second time in the program's history, and the first since 1989, while the pitching staff tallied an incredible 0.47 collective [[Earned run average|ERA]] en route to the gold medal.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the 18U National Team finished a stellar USA Baseball season on a high note. The team traveled to Panama for the 2018 COPABE U-18 Pan-American Championships in November and dominated to claim its fifth Pan-American Championships gold medal in a row and its eighth straight gold medal in international competition dating back to 2011. The team had a historic run en route to the title, outscoring its opponents 131-27 in nine games while going undefeated. The 131 runs scored is the most an 18U National Team has ever scored in international competition.\n\nCurrent Major Leaguers [[Matt Holliday]], [[Bryce Harper]], [[Clayton Kershaw]], [[Buster Posey]], [[Eric Hosmer]], [[Freddie Freeman]] and [[Justin Upton]] have all worn the USA jersey as 18U players.<ref name=\"USAB-18U\">{{cite web |title=18U National Team Home |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/18u |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+National Team Gold Medals<ref name=\"USAB-18UHist\">{{cite web |title=18U National Team History |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/18u/history |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n!Year\n!Tournament\n|-\n|2018\n|COPABE U-18 Pan-American Championships\n|-\n|2017\n|WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|2016\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|2015\n|WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|2014\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|2013\n|IBAF \"AAA\" World Cup\n|-\n|2012\n|IBAF \"AAA\" World Cup\n|-\n|2011\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|2009\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AAA\" Championships\n|-\n|1999\n|IBA Junior World Cup\n|-\n|1995\n|Junior World Championships\n|-\n|1989\n|World Youth Baseball Championships\n|-\n|1988\n|World Youth Baseball Championships\n|}\n\n===15U National Team===\nIn 2012, USA Baseball rolled out its first-ever 15U National Team. The program, which is composed of some of the most talented young players across the county, played four games in the [[Dominican Republic]] against the Dominicans and [[Puerto Rico]]. Team USA went 4\u20130 abroad, outscoring their opponents, 31\u20133.\n\nIn 2013, the 15U National Team traveled to [[Barranquilla|Baranquilla, Colombia]], for the COPABE Pan American \"AA\" Championships, where it brought home the gold medal for the first time. En route to defeating Cuba, 6\u20131, in the championship game, the 15U squad amassed a perfect record, finishing 8\u20130 in the event.\n\nCompeting in its first World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) [[U-15 Baseball World Cup]] in 2014, Team USA traveled to [[Mazatl\u00e1n|Mazatlan, Mexico]], and went 9\u20131 overall and claimed the silver medal. The 2014 campaign also saw the 15U National Team's [[Brice Turang]] bring home the 15U's first-ever USA Baseball Richard W. \"Dick\" Case Player of the Year Award. The award is given to the athlete who is not only an outstanding player on the field, but also exemplified sportsmanship and love of the game. The full list of winners can be found here.\n\nUSA Baseball's National Team Championships, 14U National Team Development Program (NTDP) and National Team Identification Series (NTIS) help the organization identify players for the 15U National Team. The National Team Championships are held in Arizona and Florida and up to 72 teams compete in each region. USA Baseball representatives and scouts select the top players from each event to make up the National Team.\n\nStarting in 2017, a new trials system was introduced for the 15U program that includes two phases and 72 athletes vying for just 20 spots on Team USA's roster. The pool of talent is then narrowed to 34 players for Phase 2 before the final 20 are named.\n\nFollowing 2018 trials and training at the National Training Complex in Cary, North Carolina, the 15U National Team traveled to [[David, Chiriqu\u00ed|David, Panama]], where it claimed the program's first-ever WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup gold medal.<ref name=\"USAB-15U\">{{cite web |title=15U National Team Home |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/15u |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+15U National Team Gold Medals<ref name=\"USAB-15UHist\">{{cite web |title=15U National Team History |url=https://www.usabaseball.com/team-usa/15u/history |publisher=USA Baseball |accessdate=January 26, 2019}}</ref>\n!Year\n!Tournament\n|-\n|2018\n|WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup\n|-\n|2017\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|-\n|2015\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|-\n|2013\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|-\n|2012\n|COPABE Pan Am \"AA\" Championships\n|}\n\n===12U National Team===\nIn 2013, USA Baseball launched its first-ever 12U National Team. The team, which was composed of some of the most talented young players from across the county, traveled to [[Taipei|Taipei City, Taiwan]], and came home with its first International Baseball Federation (IBAF) [[U-12 Baseball World Cup|12U World Cup]] gold medal. After lengthy pool play, the 12U National Team defeated the host, Chinese Taipei, in the World Cup final, 8\u20131. The game was attended by over 10,000 home fans and was broadcast throughout parts of Asia and online.\n\nThe 12U National Team is composed of players selected from the USA Baseball National Team Identification Series (NTIS), the 12U National Open through the 12U Open Development Camps and the 11U Futures Invitational.\n\nIn 2015, the 12U National Team claimed its second world championship in a row with a 7\u20132 win over Chinese Taipei in the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) [[U-12 Baseball World Cup]]. The program then followed that with a silver medal at the 2016 COPABE Pan American \"A\" Championships. A third consecutive gold medal in the WBSC U-12 Baseball World Cup in 2017 with another 7\u20132 defeat of Chinese Taipei marked the team's contribution to USA Baseball's 2017 sweep of international competition.\n\nThe 12U National Team returned to the COPABE U-12 Pan American Championships in 2018 where it claimed its first-ever gold medal in the event.

Team USA repeated as [[International Baseball Federation|IBAF]] World Cup gold medalists in 2006 in Taiwan, before taking home the bronze medal at the 2008 World Cup in Japan and again in 2010 in Venezuela.\n\nIn 2012 and 2014, the Women's National Team won the silver medal at the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) Women's Baseball World Cup in Edmonton, Canada, and [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki, Japan]], respectively. The 2015 Women's National Team competed in the [[2015 Pan American Games|Toronto 2015 Pan American Games]] and claimed gold, defeating Canada 11\u20133 to earn the championship.\n\nWhen not competing in international tournaments, the Women's National Team hosts a Women's National Team Development Program, leads youth clinics and works to grow the game of baseball among women in the U.S.\n\nThe 2018 Women's National Team was named following the Women's National Open and Women's National Team Trials in June of this year. The 20-woman team competes in the 2018 WBSC Women's Baseball World Cup, which was held in the U.S. for the first time, from August 22\u201331 at the USSSA Space Coast Complex in Viera, Florida.

It also serves to help young players accelerate their maturation and readiness for the next step in their respective baseball careers.\n\nSince the program's inception in 2012, 64 national team development program attendees have earned spots on national team rosters at the 15U, 18U and Collegiate National Team levels. Additionally, in the five years that NTDP participants have been eligible, 21 players have been selected in the first five rounds of the [[Major League Baseball draft|MLB First-Year Player Draft]].\n\n===17U National Team Development Program===\nIn 2012, USA Baseball fielded its first ever 17U National Team Development Program.

As no event currently brings in a level of talent from top to bottom that the NHSI promises, the eventual tournament champion will kick off their respective season with recognition as the top high school baseball team in the country.\n\nThe NHSI, which not only features the top teams in the country, but also some of the best amateur baseball players, is a 16-team, single-elimination championship tournament. Each participating team is guaranteed to play four games.

At its inception, the event was a tournament for 16-and-under travel baseball teams that was used to identify talent for the USA Baseball 16U National Team.\n\nWhen USA Baseball moved from [[New Jersey]] to [[Arizona]] in 1998, the then-56 team tournament moved out west as well, where it was contested at the [[Spring training|Spring Training]] homes of the [[Colorado Rockies]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]]/[[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. With the popularity and size of the event growing exponentially, it was expanded to a second location in 2001, once again including the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] with a location in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers, Fla]].\n\nIn 2009, the tournament was renamed and expanded once more, this time to include a second age group. Now called the National Team Championships, a 14U division was added to identify talent for the USA Baseball 14U National Team. However, when the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) changed its international competition age groups from 16U to 15U in 2012, a 15U division was added to the National Team Championships for the new 15U National Team, the 16U division was changed to 17U and the 17U and 14U divisions now funneled into the newly-created National Team Development Programs.\n\nThrough this event \u2013 which is still held annually in both Arizona and Florida \u2013 USA Baseball provides an opportunity for 400+ teams to showcase their ability against teams from all across the country.\n\nIn Florida, the USA Baseball National Team Championships are held in [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], at [[Roger Dean Stadium]], the Spring Training home of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Miami Marlins]], and [[FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches|The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches]], the Spring Training home of the 2017 World Series Champions [[Houston Astros]] and the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\nIn Arizona, the USA Baseball National Team Championships are held in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] and [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]], Arizona, at the Spring Training homes of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\n\n\n===Futures Invitational===\nThe USA Baseball 10U and 11U Futures Invitational are elite, invite-only youth championship events, exclusively reserved for top 10U and 11U teams and athletes.
