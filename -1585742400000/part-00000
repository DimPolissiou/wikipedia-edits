The {{convert|126|km|mi}} long [[Westfriese Omringdijk]], completed by 1250, formed by connecting existing older dikes. The Roman chronicler [[Tacitus]] mentions that the rebellious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] pierced dikes to flood their land and to protect their retreat (AD 70).<ref>Tacitus ''Histories'' V 19</ref> The word ''dijk'' originally indicated both the [[trench]] and the [[bank (geography)|bank]].

Similar to Dutch, the English origins of the word lie in digging a trench and forming the upcast soil into a bank alongside it.  This practice has meant that the name may be given to either the excavation or to the bank. Thus [[Offa's Dyke]] is a combined structure and [[Car Dyke]] is a trench \u2013 though it once had raised banks as well. In the midlands and north of England, and in the United States, a dike is what a [[ditch]] is in the south, a property-boundary marker or small drainage-channel. Where it carries a stream, it may be called a running dike as in ''Rippingale Running Dike'', which leads water from the [[catchwater drain]], Car Dyke, to the South Forty Foot Drain in [[Lincolnshire]] (TF1427). The Weir Dike is a [[soak dike]] in [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne North Fen]], near [[Twenty, Lincolnshire|Twenty]] and alongside the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]], [[Lincolnshire]]. In the [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] [[The Broads|Broads]], a dyke may be a drainage ditch or a narrow artificial channel off a river or broad for access or mooring, some longer dykes being named, e.g. Candle Dyke.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.countrysideaccess.norfolk.gov.uk/news-details.aspx?id=119 \n|title= Weavers' Way footpath closure&nbsp;\u2014 Decoy Road (Hickling) to Potter Heigham 7 January 2011 \u2013 6 April 2012 \n|publisher= Countrysideaccess.norfolk.gov.uk \n|accessdate= 2013-05-17\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn parts of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], particularly [[Scotland]], a dyke may be a field wall, generally made with [[dry stone]].\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Versterkt talud. Locatie. Haven van Laaxum 002.JPG|thumb|A reinforced embankment]]\n\nThe main purpose of artificial levees is to prevent flooding of the adjoining [[countryside]] and to slow natural course changes in a waterway to provide reliable shipping lanes for maritime commerce over time; they also confine the flow of the river, resulting in higher and faster water flow. Levees can be mainly found along the sea, where dunes are not strong enough, along rivers for protection against high-floods, along lakes or along [[polder]]s. Furthermore, levees have been built for the purpose of empoldering, or as a boundary for an inundation area. The latter can be a controlled inundation by the military or a measure to prevent inundation of a larger area surrounded by levees. Levees have also been built as field boundaries and as military [[fortification|defences]]. More on this type of levee can be found in the article on [[dry-stone wall]]s.\n\nLevees can be permanent [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] or emergency constructions (often of [[sandbag]]s) built hastily in a flood emergency. When such an emergency bank is added on top of an existing levee it is known as a ''cradge''.\n\nSome of the earliest levees were constructed by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]] from circa 2600 BC) on which the agrarian life of the Harappan peoples depended.<ref>{{cite web | title = Indus River Valley Civilizations | website = History-world.org | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | url = http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/68HwtFCFs?url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Levees were also constructed over 3,000 years ago in [[ancient Egypt]], where a system of levees was built along the left bank of the [[River Nile]] for more than {{convert|600|mi|km}}, stretching from modern [[Aswan]] to the [[Nile Delta]] on the shores of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations and [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] also built large levee systems.<ref>Needham, Joseph. (1971). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brian Lander. \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T\u2019oung Pao 100.4\u20135 (2014): 325\u201362.</ref> Because a levee is only as strong as its weakest point, the height and standards of construction have to be consistent along its length. Some authorities have argued that this requires a strong governing authority to guide the work, and may have been a catalyst for the development of systems of governance in early civilizations.  However, others point to evidence of large scale water-control earthen works such as canals and/or levees dating from before [[King Scorpion]] in [[Predynastic Egypt]], during which governance was far less centralized.\n\nAnother example of a historical levee that protected the growing city-state of M\u0113xihco-Ten\u014dchtitlan and the neighbouring city of Tlatel\u014dlco, was constructed during the early 1400s, under the supervision of the tlahtoani of the altepetl Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl. Its function was to separate the brackish waters of Lake Texcoco (ideal for the agricultural technique ''Chin\u0101mitls'') from the fresh potable water supplied to the settlements. However, after the Europeans destroyed Tenochtitlan, the levee was also destroyed and flooding became a major problem, which resulted in the majority of The Lake to be drained in the 17th Century.\n\nLevees are usually built by piling earth on a cleared, level surface. Broad at the base, they taper to a level top, where temporary embankments or sandbags can be placed. Because flood discharge intensity increases in levees on both [[river bank]]s, and because [[silt]] deposits raise the level of [[Stream bed|riverbeds]], planning and auxiliary measures are vital. Sections are often set back from the river to form a wider channel, and flood valley basins are divided by multiple levees to prevent a single breach from flooding a large area. A levee made from stones laid in horizontal rows with a bed of thin turf between each of them is known as a ''spetchel''.\n\nArtificial levees require substantial engineering. Their surface must be protected from erosion, so they are planted with vegetation such as [[Bermuda grass]] in order to bind the earth together. On the land side of high levees, a low terrace of earth known as a ''banquette'' is usually added as another anti-erosion measure. On the river side, erosion from strong waves or currents presents an even greater threat to the integrity of the levee. The effects of erosion are countered by planting suitable vegetation or installing stones, boulders, weighted matting or concrete [[revetment]]s. Separate ditches or drainage tiles are constructed to ensure that the foundation does not become waterlogged.\n\n=== River flood prevention ===\n[[File:Sacramento River broken levee.jpg|thumb|Broken levee on the Sacramento River]]\n[[File:GretnaLevee.jpg|thumb|A levee keeps high water on the Mississippi River from flooding [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]], [[Louisiana]], in March 2005.]]\n\nProminent levee systems have been built along the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Sacramento River]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Po River|Po]], [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River]], [[Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Loire]], [[Vistula]], the delta formed by the Rhine, Maas/Meuse and [[Scheldt]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Danube]] in [[Europe]]. During the Chinese [[Warring States period]], the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]] was built by the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] as a water conservation and flood control project. The system's infrastructure is located on the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang]] ({{zh|c=\u5cb7\u6c5f|p=M\u00ednji\u0101ng}}), which is the longest tributary of the [[Chang Jiang]], in [[Sichuan]], [[China]].\n\nThe Mississippi levee system represents one of the largest such systems found anywhere in the world. It comprises over {{convert|3500|mi|km}} of levees extending some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} along the Mississippi, stretching from [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]], [[Missouri]], to the [[Mississippi Delta]]. They were begun by French settlers in [[Louisiana]] in the 18th century to protect the city of [[New Orleans]].<ref name=Kemp>Kemp, Katherine. [http://www.tulane.edu/~bfleury/envirobio/enviroweb/FloodControl.htm ''The Mississippi Levee System and the Old River Control Structure''The Louisiana Environment.] Tulane.edu</ref> The first Louisiana levees were about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high and covered a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km}} along the riverside.<ref name=Kemp/> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Mississippi River Commission, extended the levee system beginning in 1882 to cover the riverbanks from [[Cairo, Illinois]] to the mouth of the [[Mississippi delta]] in Louisiana.<ref name=Kemp/> By the mid-1980s, they had reached their present extent and averaged {{convert|24|ft|m}} in height; some Mississippi levees are as high as {{convert|50|ft|m}}. The Mississippi levees also include some of the longest continuous individual levees in the world. One such levee extends southwards from [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]], for a distance of some {{convert|380|mi|km}}.\n\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recommends and supports Cellular Confinement technology (geocells) as a best management practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA354949|title= levee rehabilitation in USACE Technical Report REMR-GT-26, Innovative Methods for Levee Rehabilitation|author=Edward B. Perry|date=September 1998|website=Dtic.mil|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Particular attention is given to the matter of surface erosion, overtopping prevention and protection of levee crest and downstream slope. Reinforcement with geocells provides tensile force to the soil to better resist instability.\n\nArtificial levees can lead to an elevation of the natural river bed over time; whether this happens or not and how fast, depends on different factors, one of them being the amount and type of the [[bed load]] of a river. [[Alluvium|Alluvial]] rivers with intense accumulations of sediment tend to this behavior. Examples of rivers where artificial levees led to an elevation of the river bed, even up to a point where the river bed is higher than the adjacent ground surface behind the levees, are found for the [[Yellow River]] in China and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] in the USA.\n\n=== Coastal flood prevention ===\nLevees are very common on the marshlands bordering the [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].  The [[Acadians]] who settled the area can be credited with the original construction of many of the levees in the area, created for the purpose of farming the fertile tidal marshlands. These levees are referred to as dykes. They are constructed with hinged sluice gates that open on the falling tide to drain freshwater from the agricultural marshlands, and close on the rising tide to prevent seawater from entering behind the dyke. These sluice gates are called \"[[aboiteau]]x\". In the [[Lower Mainland]] around the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], there are levees (known locally as dikes, and also referred to as \"the sea wall\") to protect low-lying land in the [[Fraser River]] delta, particularly the city of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] on [[Lulu Island]]. There are also dikes to protect other locations which have flooded in the past, such as the Pitt Polder, land adjacent to the [[Pitt River]] and other tributary rivers.\n\nCoastal flood prevention levees are also common along the inland coastline behind the [[Wadden Sea]], an area devastated by many historic floods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waddensea-secretariat.org/sites/default/files/downloads/03.1-coastal-defence-10-05-14.pdf|title=Trilateral Working Group on Coastal Protection and Sea Level Rise (CPSL), Wadden Sea Ecosystem No. 25 by Jacobus Hofstede, Common Wadden Sea Secretariat (CWSS), Wilhelmshaven, Germany, 2009|website=Waddensea-secretariat.org|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Thus the peoples and governments have erected increasingly large and complex flood protection levee systems to stop the sea even during storm floods.  The biggest of these are of course the huge levees in the [[Netherlands]], which have gone beyond just defending against floods, as they have aggressively taken back land that is below mean sea level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/specificplacesofinterest/a/dykes.htm|title=Dikes of the Netherlands&nbsp;\u2014 Geography|author=Matt Rosenberg|website=Geography.about.com}}</ref> <!-- {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some source reference may be reused from the Netherlands article -->\n\n=== Spur dykes or groynes ===\n{{see also|Jetty|Breakwater (structure)}}\nThese typically man-made hydraulic structures are situated to protect against erosion. They are typically placed in alluvial rivers perpendicular, or at an angle, to the bank of the channel or the [[revetment]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nenpo/no51/ronbunB/a51b0p64.pdf |title=Hao Zhang, Hajime Nakagawa, 2008, ''Scour around Spur Dyke: Recent Advances and Future Researches''|website=Dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp|accessdate=2013-05-17}}</ref> and are used widely along coastlines. There are two common types of spur dyke, permeable and impermeable, depending on the materials used to construct them.\n\n=== Super levee ===\nImportant cities in Japan (Tokyo and Osaka) developed a new flood protection known as Super levee. Super levees are thicker levees that will not fail even in the most extreme events<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sciengsustainability.blogspot.com/2018/09/levee-and-super-levee.html|title=Levee and Super Levee|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>.\n\n== Natural examples{{anchor|Natural levee|Natural levees}} ==\nNatural levees commonly form around lowland rivers and creeks without human intervention. They are elongate ridges of mud and/or silt that form on the river floodplains immediately adjacent to the cut banks. Like artificial levees, they act to reduce the likelihood of floodplain inundation.\n\nDeposition of levees is a natural consequence of the flooding of meandering rivers which carry high proportions of [[suspended sediment]] in the form of fine sands, silts, and muds. Because the carrying capacity of a river depends in part on its depth, the sediment in the water which is over the flooded banks of the channel is no longer capable of keeping the same amount of fine sediments in suspension as the main [[thalweg]]. The extra fine sediments thus settle out quickly on the parts of the floodplain nearest to the channel. Over a significant number of floods, this will eventually result in the building up of ridges in these positions, and reducing the likelihood of further floods and episodes of levee building.\n\nIf aggradation continues to occur in the main channel, this will make levee overtopping more likely again, and the levees can continue to build up. In some cases this can result in the channel bed eventually rising above the surrounding floodplains, penned in only by the levees around it; an example is the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]] near the sea, where oceangoing ships appear to sail high above the plain on the elevated river.\n\nLevees are common in any river with a high suspended sediment fraction, and thus are intimately associated with [[meander]]ing channels, which also are more likely to occur where a river carries large fractions of suspended sediment. For similar reasons, they are also common in tidal creeks, where tides bring in large amounts of coastal silts and muds. High [[Spring tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|spring tides]] will cause flooding, and result in the building up of levees.\n\n== Failures and breaches ==\n{{Main|Levee breach}}\n\nBoth natural and man-made levees can fail in a number of ways. Factors that cause levee failure include overtopping, erosion, structural failures, and levee saturation. The most frequent (and dangerous) is a ''[[levee breach]]''.  Here, a part of the levee actually breaks or is eroded away, leaving a large opening for water to flood land otherwise protected by the levee. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure, caused either by surface erosion or by subsurface weakness in the levee. A breach can leave a fan-shaped deposit of sediment radiating away from the breach, described as a [[crevasse splay]]. In natural levees, once a breach has occurred, the gap in the levee will remain until it is again filled in by levee building processes. This increases the chances of future breaches occurring in the same location. Breaches can be the location of [[meander cutoff]]s if the river flow direction is permanently diverted through the gap.\n\nSometimes levees are said to fail when water ''overtops'' the crest of the levee. This will cause flooding on the floodplains, but because it does not damage the levee, it has fewer consequences for future flooding.\n\nAmong various failure mechanisms that cause levee breaches, [[soil erosion]] is found to be one of the most important factors. Predicting soil erosion and scour generation when overtopping happens is important in order to design stable levee and [[floodwall]]s. There have been numerous studies to investigate the erodibility of soils. Briaud et al. (2008)<ref>Briaud, J., Chen, H., Govindasamy, A., Storesund, R. (2008). Levee erosion by overtopping in New Orleans during the Katrina Hurricane. Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering. 134 (5): 618\u2013632.</ref> used Erosion Function Apparatus (EFA) test to measure the erodibility of the soils and afterwards by using Chen 3D software, numerical simulations were performed on the levee to find out the velocity vectors in the overtopping water and the generated scour when the overtopping water impinges the levee. By analyzing the results from EFA test, an erosion chart to categorize erodibility of the soils was developed.  Hughes and Nadal in 2009<ref>Hughes, S.A., Nadal, N.C. (2009). Laboratory study of combined wave overtopping and storm surge overflow of a levee. Coastal Engineering.56: 244\u2013259</ref> studied the effect of combination of wave overtopping and storm surge overflow on the erosion and scour generation in levees. The study included hydraulic parameters and flow characteristics such as flow thickness, wave intervals, surge level above levee crown in analyzing scour development. According to the laboratory tests, empirical correlations related to average overtopping discharge were derived to analyze the resistance of levee against erosion. These equations could only fit to the situation similar to the experimental tests while they can give a reasonable estimation if applied to other conditions.\n\nOsouli et al. (2014) and Karimpour et al. (2015) conducted lab scale physical modeling of levees to evaluate score characterization of different levees due to floodwall overtopping.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scour Characteristics of Saturated Levees Due to Floodwall Overtopping|last1=Karimpour Mazdak|last2=Heinzl Kyle|last3=Stendback Emaline|last4=Galle Kevin|last5=Zamiran Siavash|last6=Osouli Abdolreza|journal=Ifcee 2015|year = 2015|pages = 1298\u20131307|doi=10.1061/9780784479087.117|isbn = 9780784479087}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275033990|title=Levee Erosion and Scour Potential Due to Floodwall Overtopping (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\nAnother approach applied to prevent levee failures is [[electrical resistivity tomography]] (ERT). This non-destructive geophysical method can detect in advance critical saturation areas in embankments. ERT can thus be used in monitoring of seepage phenomena in earth structures and act as an early warning system, e.g. in critical parts of levees or embankments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arosio|first=Diego|last2=Munda|first2=Stefano|last3=Tresoldi|first3=Greta|last4=Papini|first4=Monica|last5=Longoni|first5=Laura|last6=Zanzi|first6=Luigi|date=2017-10-13|title=A customized resistivity system for monitoring saturation and seepage in earthen levees: installation and validation|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=457\u2013467|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0035|issn=2391-5447|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...35A}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Bridge scour}}\n* {{annotated link|Bunding}}\n* {{annotated link|Coupure}}\n* {{annotated link|Dam}}\n* {{annotated link|Earth structure}}\n* {{annotated link|Flood control}}\n* {{annotated link|Lava levee}}\n* {{annotated link|Nullah}}\n* {{annotated link|Seawall}}\n* {{annotated link|Sleeper dike}}\n* {{annotated link|Subsidence}}\n* {{annotated link|Trench}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Lev\u00e9e}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Dikes}}\n\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA24 \"Well Diggers Trick\", June 1951, ''Popular Science''] article on how flood control engineers were using an old method to protect flood levees along rivers from seepage undermining the levee\n* [http://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerManuals/EM_1110-2-1913.pdf \"Design and Construction of Levees\" US Army Engineer Manual EM-1110-2-1913]\n* [https://www.ciria.org/Resources/Free_publications/I_L_H/ILH_resources.aspx The International Levee Handbook]\n\n{{coastal management|state=expanded}}\n{{Infrastructure}}\n{{Earth's landforms}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dikes| ]]\n[[Category:Flood control]]\n[[Category:Fluvial landforms]]\n[[Category:Riparian zone]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2018}}\n{{lead too short|date=December 2015}}\n}}\n{{short description|Ridge or wall to hold back water}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n[[file:River Levee Cross Section Figure.svg|thumb|Components of a levee:\n{{ordered list\n| 1 = Design high water level (HWL)\n| 2 = Low water channel\n| 3 = Flood channel\n| 4 = Riverside slope\n| 5 = Riverside banquette\n| 6 = Levee crown\n| 7 = Landside slope\n| 8 = Landside banquette\n| 9 = Berm\n| 10 = Low water revetment\n| 11 = Riverside land\n| 12 = Levee\n| 13 = Protected lowland\n| 14 = River zone\n}}]]\n[[file:Sacramento River Levee.jpg|thumb|The side of a levee in [[Sacramento, California]]]]\n\nA '''levee''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|\u025b|v|i}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/levee|title=levee \u2013 meaning of levee in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English |website=Ldoceonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/levee?a=british|title=levee Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=Dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref> '''dike''', '''dyke''', '''embankment''', '''floodbank''' or '''stopbank''' is an elongated naturally occurring ridge or artificially constructed [[fill dirt|fill]] or wall that regulates water levels.

Locatie. Haven van Laaxum 002.JPG|thumb|A reinforced embankment]]\n\nThe main purpose of artificial levees is to prevent flooding of the adjoining [[countryside]] and to slow natural course changes in a waterway to provide reliable shipping lanes for maritime commerce over time; they also confine the flow of the river, resulting in higher and faster water flow. Levees can be mainly found along the sea, where dunes are not strong enough, along rivers for protection against high-floods, along lakes or along [[polder]]s. Furthermore, levees have been built for the purpose of empoldering, or as a boundary for an inundation area. The latter can be a controlled inundation by the military or a measure to prevent inundation of a larger area surrounded by levees. Levees have also been built as field boundaries and as military [[fortification|defences]]. More on this type of levee can be found in the article on [[dry-stone wall]]s.\n\nLevees can be permanent [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] or emergency constructions (often of [[sandbag]]s) built hastily in a flood emergency. When such an emergency bank is added on top of an existing levee it is known as a ''cradge''.\n\nSome of the earliest levees were constructed by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]] from circa 2600 BC) on which the agrarian life of the Harappan peoples depended.<ref>{{cite web | title = Indus River Valley Civilizations | website = History-world.org | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | url = http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/68HwtFCFs?url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Levees were also constructed over 3,000 years ago in [[ancient Egypt]], where a system of levees was built along the left bank of the [[River Nile]] for more than {{convert|600|mi|km}}, stretching from modern [[Aswan]] to the [[Nile Delta]] on the shores of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations and [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] also built large levee systems.<ref>Needham, Joseph. (1971). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brian Lander. \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T\u2019oung Pao 100.4\u20135 (2014): 325\u201362.</ref> Because a levee is only as strong as its weakest point, the height and standards of construction have to be consistent along its length. Some authorities have argued that this requires a strong governing authority to guide the work, and may have been a catalyst for the development of systems of governance in early civilizations.  However, others point to evidence of large scale water-control earthen works such as canals and/or levees dating from before [[King Scorpion]] in [[Predynastic Egypt]], during which governance was far less centralized.\n\nAnother example of a historical levee that protected the growing city-state of M\u0113xihco-Ten\u014dchtitlan and the neighbouring city of Tlatel\u014dlco, was constructed during the early 1400s, under the supervision of the tlahtoani of the altepetl Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl. Its function was to separate the brackish waters of Lake Texcoco (ideal for the agricultural technique ''Chin\u0101mitls'') from the fresh potable water supplied to the settlements. However, after the Europeans destroyed Tenochtitlan, the levee was also destroyed and flooding became a major problem, which resulted in the majority of The Lake to be drained in the 17th Century.\n\nLevees are usually built by piling earth on a cleared, level surface. Broad at the base, they taper to a level top, where temporary embankments or sandbags can be placed. Because flood discharge intensity increases in levees on both [[river bank]]s, and because [[silt]] deposits raise the level of [[Stream bed|riverbeds]], planning and auxiliary measures are vital. Sections are often set back from the river to form a wider channel, and flood valley basins are divided by multiple levees to prevent a single breach from flooding a large area. A levee made from stones laid in horizontal rows with a bed of thin turf between each of them is known as a ''spetchel''.\n\nArtificial levees require substantial engineering. Their surface must be protected from erosion, so they are planted with vegetation such as [[Bermuda grass]] in order to bind the earth together. On the land side of high levees, a low terrace of earth known as a ''banquette'' is usually added as another anti-erosion measure. On the river side, erosion from strong waves or currents presents an even greater threat to the integrity of the levee. The effects of erosion are countered by planting suitable vegetation or installing stones, boulders, weighted matting or concrete [[revetment]]s. Separate ditches or drainage tiles are constructed to ensure that the foundation does not become waterlogged.\n\n=== River flood prevention ===\n[[File:Sacramento River broken levee.jpg|thumb|Broken levee on the Sacramento River]]\n[[File:GretnaLevee.jpg|thumb|A levee keeps high water on the Mississippi River from flooding [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]], [[Louisiana]], in March 2005.]]\n\nProminent levee systems have been built along the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Sacramento River]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Po River|Po]], [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River]], [[Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Loire]], [[Vistula]], the delta formed by the Rhine, Maas/Meuse and [[Scheldt]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Danube]] in [[Europe]]. During the Chinese [[Warring States period]], the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]] was built by the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] as a water conservation and flood control project. The system's infrastructure is located on the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang]] ({{zh|c=\u5cb7\u6c5f|p=M\u00ednji\u0101ng}}), which is the longest tributary of the [[Chang Jiang]], in [[Sichuan]], [[China]].\n\nThe Mississippi levee system represents one of the largest such systems found anywhere in the world. It comprises over {{convert|3500|mi|km}} of levees extending some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} along the Mississippi, stretching from [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]], [[Missouri]], to the [[Mississippi Delta]]. They were begun by French settlers in [[Louisiana]] in the 18th century to protect the city of [[New Orleans]].<ref name=Kemp>Kemp, Katherine. [http://www.tulane.edu/~bfleury/envirobio/enviroweb/FloodControl.htm ''The Mississippi Levee System and the Old River Control Structure''The Louisiana Environment.] Tulane.edu</ref> The first Louisiana levees were about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high and covered a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km}} along the riverside.<ref name=Kemp/> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Mississippi River Commission, extended the levee system beginning in 1882 to cover the riverbanks from [[Cairo, Illinois]] to the mouth of the [[Mississippi delta]] in Louisiana.<ref name=Kemp/> By the mid-1980s, they had reached their present extent and averaged {{convert|24|ft|m}} in height; some Mississippi levees are as high as {{convert|50|ft|m}}. The Mississippi levees also include some of the longest continuous individual levees in the world. One such levee extends southwards from [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]], for a distance of some {{convert|380|mi|km}}.\n\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recommends and supports Cellular Confinement technology (geocells) as a best management practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA354949|title= levee rehabilitation in USACE Technical Report REMR-GT-26, Innovative Methods for Levee Rehabilitation|author=Edward B. Perry|date=September 1998|website=Dtic.mil|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Particular attention is given to the matter of surface erosion, overtopping prevention and protection of levee crest and downstream slope. Reinforcement with geocells provides tensile force to the soil to better resist instability.\n\nArtificial levees can lead to an elevation of the natural river bed over time; whether this happens or not and how fast, depends on different factors, one of them being the amount and type of the [[bed load]] of a river. [[Alluvium|Alluvial]] rivers with intense accumulations of sediment tend to this behavior. Examples of rivers where artificial levees led to an elevation of the river bed, even up to a point where the river bed is higher than the adjacent ground surface behind the levees, are found for the [[Yellow River]] in China and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] in the USA.\n\n=== Coastal flood prevention ===\nLevees are very common on the marshlands bordering the [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].  The [[Acadians]] who settled the area can be credited with the original construction of many of the levees in the area, created for the purpose of farming the fertile tidal marshlands. These levees are referred to as dykes. They are constructed with hinged sluice gates that open on the falling tide to drain freshwater from the agricultural marshlands, and close on the rising tide to prevent seawater from entering behind the dyke. These sluice gates are called \"[[aboiteau]]x\". In the [[Lower Mainland]] around the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], there are levees (known locally as dikes, and also referred to as \"the sea wall\") to protect low-lying land in the [[Fraser River]] delta, particularly the city of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] on [[Lulu Island]]. There are also dikes to protect other locations which have flooded in the past, such as the Pitt Polder, land adjacent to the [[Pitt River]] and other tributary rivers.\n\nCoastal flood prevention levees are also common along the inland coastline behind the [[Wadden Sea]], an area devastated by many historic floods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waddensea-secretariat.org/sites/default/files/downloads/03.1-coastal-defence-10-05-14.pdf|title=Trilateral Working Group on Coastal Protection and Sea Level Rise (CPSL), Wadden Sea Ecosystem No. 25 by Jacobus Hofstede, Common Wadden Sea Secretariat (CWSS), Wilhelmshaven, Germany, 2009|website=Waddensea-secretariat.org|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Thus the peoples and governments have erected increasingly large and complex flood protection levee systems to stop the sea even during storm floods.  The biggest of these are of course the huge levees in the [[Netherlands]], which have gone beyond just defending against floods, as they have aggressively taken back land that is below mean sea level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/specificplacesofinterest/a/dykes.htm|title=Dikes of the Netherlands&nbsp;\u2014 Geography|author=Matt Rosenberg|website=Geography.about.com}}</ref> <!-- {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some source reference may be reused from the Netherlands article -->\n\n=== Spur dykes or groynes ===\n{{see also|Jetty|Breakwater (structure)}}\nThese typically man-made hydraulic structures are situated to protect against erosion. They are typically placed in alluvial rivers perpendicular, or at an angle, to the bank of the channel or the [[revetment]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nenpo/no51/ronbunB/a51b0p64.pdf |title=Hao Zhang, Hajime Nakagawa, 2008, ''Scour around Spur Dyke: Recent Advances and Future Researches''|website=Dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp|accessdate=2013-05-17}}</ref> and are used widely along coastlines. There are two common types of spur dyke, permeable and impermeable, depending on the materials used to construct them.\n\n=== Super levee ===\nImportant cities in Japan (Tokyo and Osaka) developed a new flood protection known as Super levee. Super levees are thicker levees that will not fail even in the most extreme events<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sciengsustainability.blogspot.com/2018/09/levee-and-super-levee.html|title=Levee and Super Levee|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>.\n\n== Natural examples{{anchor|Natural levee|Natural levees}} ==\nNatural levees commonly form around lowland rivers and creeks without human intervention. They are elongate ridges of mud and/or silt that form on the river floodplains immediately adjacent to the cut banks. Like artificial levees, they act to reduce the likelihood of floodplain inundation.\n\nDeposition of levees is a natural consequence of the flooding of meandering rivers which carry high proportions of [[suspended sediment]] in the form of fine sands, silts, and muds. Because the carrying capacity of a river depends in part on its depth, the sediment in the water which is over the flooded banks of the channel is no longer capable of keeping the same amount of fine sediments in suspension as the main [[thalweg]]. The extra fine sediments thus settle out quickly on the parts of the floodplain nearest to the channel. Over a significant number of floods, this will eventually result in the building up of ridges in these positions, and reducing the likelihood of further floods and episodes of levee building.\n\nIf aggradation continues to occur in the main channel, this will make levee overtopping more likely again, and the levees can continue to build up. In some cases this can result in the channel bed eventually rising above the surrounding floodplains, penned in only by the levees around it; an example is the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]] near the sea, where oceangoing ships appear to sail high above the plain on the elevated river.\n\nLevees are common in any river with a high suspended sediment fraction, and thus are intimately associated with [[meander]]ing channels, which also are more likely to occur where a river carries large fractions of suspended sediment. For similar reasons, they are also common in tidal creeks, where tides bring in large amounts of coastal silts and muds. High [[Spring tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|spring tides]] will cause flooding, and result in the building up of levees.\n\n== Failures and breaches ==\n{{Main|Levee breach}}\n\nBoth natural and man-made levees can fail in a number of ways. Factors that cause levee failure include overtopping, erosion, structural failures, and levee saturation. The most frequent (and dangerous) is a ''[[levee breach]]''.  Here, a part of the levee actually breaks or is eroded away, leaving a large opening for water to flood land otherwise protected by the levee. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure, caused either by surface erosion or by subsurface weakness in the levee. A breach can leave a fan-shaped deposit of sediment radiating away from the breach, described as a [[crevasse splay]]. In natural levees, once a breach has occurred, the gap in the levee will remain until it is again filled in by levee building processes. This increases the chances of future breaches occurring in the same location. Breaches can be the location of [[meander cutoff]]s if the river flow direction is permanently diverted through the gap.\n\nSometimes levees are said to fail when water ''overtops'' the crest of the levee. This will cause flooding on the floodplains, but because it does not damage the levee, it has fewer consequences for future flooding.\n\nAmong various failure mechanisms that cause levee breaches, [[soil erosion]] is found to be one of the most important factors. Predicting soil erosion and scour generation when overtopping happens is important in order to design stable levee and [[floodwall]]s. There have been numerous studies to investigate the erodibility of soils. Briaud et al. (2008)<ref>Briaud, J., Chen, H., Govindasamy, A., Storesund, R. (2008). Levee erosion by overtopping in New Orleans during the Katrina Hurricane. Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering. 134 (5): 618\u2013632.</ref> used Erosion Function Apparatus (EFA) test to measure the erodibility of the soils and afterwards by using Chen 3D software, numerical simulations were performed on the levee to find out the velocity vectors in the overtopping water and the generated scour when the overtopping water impinges the levee. By analyzing the results from EFA test, an erosion chart to categorize erodibility of the soils was developed.  Hughes and Nadal in 2009<ref>Hughes, S.A., Nadal, N.C. (2009). Laboratory study of combined wave overtopping and storm surge overflow of a levee. Coastal Engineering.56: 244\u2013259</ref> studied the effect of combination of wave overtopping and storm surge overflow on the erosion and scour generation in levees. The study included hydraulic parameters and flow characteristics such as flow thickness, wave intervals, surge level above levee crown in analyzing scour development. According to the laboratory tests, empirical correlations related to average overtopping discharge were derived to analyze the resistance of levee against erosion. These equations could only fit to the situation similar to the experimental tests while they can give a reasonable estimation if applied to other conditions.\n\nOsouli et al. (2014) and Karimpour et al. (2015) conducted lab scale physical modeling of levees to evaluate score characterization of different levees due to floodwall overtopping.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scour Characteristics of Saturated Levees Due to Floodwall Overtopping|last1=Karimpour Mazdak|last2=Heinzl Kyle|last3=Stendback Emaline|last4=Galle Kevin|last5=Zamiran Siavash|last6=Osouli Abdolreza|journal=Ifcee 2015|year = 2015|pages = 1298\u20131307|doi=10.1061/9780784479087.117|isbn = 9780784479087}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275033990|title=Levee Erosion and Scour Potential Due to Floodwall Overtopping (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\nAnother approach applied to prevent levee failures is [[electrical resistivity tomography]] (ERT). This non-destructive geophysical method can detect in advance critical saturation areas in embankments. ERT can thus be used in monitoring of seepage phenomena in earth structures and act as an early warning system, e.g. in critical parts of levees or embankments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arosio|first=Diego|last2=Munda|first2=Stefano|last3=Tresoldi|first3=Greta|last4=Papini|first4=Monica|last5=Longoni|first5=Laura|last6=Zanzi|first6=Luigi|date=2017-10-13|title=A customized resistivity system for monitoring saturation and seepage in earthen levees: installation and validation|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=457\u2013467|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0035|issn=2391-5447|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...35A}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Bridge scour}}\n* {{annotated link|Bunding}}\n* {{annotated link|Coupure}}\n* {{annotated link|Dam}}\n* {{annotated link|Earth structure}}\n* {{annotated link|Flood control}}\n* {{annotated link|Lava levee}}\n* {{annotated link|Nullah}}\n* {{annotated link|Seawall}}\n* {{annotated link|Sleeper dike}}\n* {{annotated link|Subsidence}}\n* {{annotated link|Trench}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Lev\u00e9e}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Dikes}}\n\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA24 \"Well Diggers Trick\", June 1951, ''Popular Science''] article on how flood control engineers were using an old method to protect flood levees along rivers from seepage undermining the levee\n* [http://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerManuals/EM_1110-2-1913.pdf \"Design and Construction of Levees\" US Army Engineer Manual EM-1110-2-1913]\n* [https://www.ciria.org/Resources/Free_publications/I_L_H/ILH_resources.aspx The International Levee Handbook]\n\n{{coastal management|state=expanded}}\n{{Infrastructure}}\n{{Earth's landforms}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dikes| ]]\n[[Category:Flood control]]\n[[Category:Fluvial landforms]]\n[[Category:Riparian zone]]\n", "name_user": "86.41.203.42", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee"}

The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, [[perennial plants]] and some simple animals are potentially [[biologically immortal]]. In the broader sense, aging can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing ([[cellular senescence]]) or to the population of a species ([[population ageing]]).\n\nIn humans, aging represents the accumulation of changes in a human being over time, encompassing [[Human body|physical]], [[psychological]], and social changes. Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world events and wisdom may expand. Aging is among the greatest known [[risk factor]]s for [[Aging-associated diseases|most human diseases]]: of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die from age-related causes.\n\nThe causes of aging are uncertain; current theories are assigned to the damage concept, whereby the accumulation of damage (such as [[DNA oxidation]]) may cause biological systems to fail, or to the programmed aging concept, whereby internal processes (such as [[DNA methylation]]) may cause aging. Programmed aging should not be confused with programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).\n\n== Aging versus immortality ==\n[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Immortal ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', a relative of the jellyfish]]\nHuman beings and members of other species, especially animals, have a tendency to develop aging.

When organisms restrict their diet, mTOR activity is reduced, which allows an increased level of autophagy. This recycles old or damaged cell parts, which increases longevity and decreases the chances of being obese. This is thought to prevent spikes of [[glucose]] concentration in the blood, leading to reduced insulin signalling. This has been linked to less mTOR activation as well.  Therefore, longevity has been connected to caloric restriction and insulin sensitivity inhibiting mTOR, which in turns allows autophagy to occur more frequently.  It may be that mTOR inhibition and autophagy reduce the effects of [[reactive oxygen species]] on the body, which damage DNA and other organic material, so longevity would be increased.<ref name=\"Johnson et al 2013\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature11861 |title=MTOR is a key modulator of aging and age-related disease |year=2013 |last1=Johnson |first1=Simon C. |last2=Rabinovitch |first2=Peter S. |last3=Kaeberlein |first3=Matt |journal=Nature |volume=493 |issue=7432 |pages=338\u201345 |pmid=23325216 |pmc=3687363|bibcode=2013Natur.493..338J }}</ref> In support of this contention are observations that several purported anti-aging remedies such as rapamycin, metformin, berberine, 2-deoxyglucose, vitamin D3, aspirin and resveratrol were shown to suppress mTOR signaling and concurrently to reduce constitutive level of oxidative DNA damage induced by endogenous oxidants as well as to enhance the rate of autophagy<ref>Halicka HD, Zhao H, Li J, Lee YS, Hsieh TC, Wu JM, Darzynkiewicz Z.

DePinho]] and his colleagues published research on mice where [[telomerase]] activity was first genetically removed. Then, after the mice had prematurely aged, they restored telomerase activity by reactivating the telomerase gene. As a result, the mice were rejuvenated: Shrivelled testes grew back to normal and the animals regained their fertility. Other organs, such as the spleen, liver, intestines and brain, recuperated from their degenerated state. \"[The finding] offers the possibility that normal human aging could be slowed by reawakening the enzyme in cells where it has stopped working\" says Ronald DePinho. However, activating telomerase in humans could potentially encourage the growth of tumours.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/news.2010.635 |title=Telomerase reverses ageing process |year=2010 |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |journal=Nature}}</ref>\n\n<!--The Bartke2011 reference has a lot of information on specific mutations which could be discussed here.-->\nMost known genetic interventions in ''C. elegans'' increase lifespan by 1.5 to 2.5-fold. {{as of|2009}}, the record for lifespan extension in C.

The age of an adult human is commonly measured in whole years since the day of birth. Arbitrary divisions set to mark periods of life may include: [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] (via [[Infant|infancy]], [[childhood]], [[preadolescence]], [[adolescence]]), [[Emerging adulthood and early adulthood|early adulthood]], [[Middle age|middle adulthood]], and [[Senior citizen|late adulthood]]. More casual terms may include \"teenagers\", \"[[Tween (demographic)|tweens]]\", \"twentysomething\", \"thirtysomething\", etc. as well as \"denarian\", \"vicenarian\", \"tricenarian\", \"quadragenarian\", etc.\n\nMost legal systems define a specific age for when an individual is allowed or obliged to do particular activities. These age specifications include [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], [[age of consent]], [[age of majority]], [[age of criminal responsibility]], [[marriageable age]], [[age of candidacy]], and [[mandatory retirement age]]. Admission to a movie for instance, may depend on age according to a [[motion picture rating system]]. A bus fare might be discounted for the young or old. Each nation, government and non-governmental organisation has different ways of classifying age. In other words, [[Chronology|chronological]] aging may be distinguished from \"social aging\" (cultural age-expectations of how people should act as they grow older) and \"biological aging\" (an organism's physical state as it ages).<ref>Phillips, Judith, Kristine Ajrouch, and Sarah Hillcoat-Nall\u00e9tamby (2010) ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology''.

Population aging has three possible causes: migration, longer [[life expectancy]] (decreased death rate) and decreased birth rate. Aging has a significant impact on society. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the [[age of majority]]), they are more likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights.<ref name=\"Vincent 2005\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00084.x |title=Understanding generations: Political economy and culture in an ageing society |year=2005 |last1=Vincent |first1=John A. |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=579\u201399 |pmid=16309437|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c8c9e3dcf54b1c9b7591e680ec964fc5c466367 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, one of the most significant population trends is aging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/population-ageing-and-development-0 |title=Population Ageing and Development |year=2002 |publisher= UNFPA}}</ref> Currently, over 11% of the world's current population are people aged 60 and older and the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) estimates that by 2050 that number will rise to approximately 22%.<ref name=\"Ageing in the Twenty-First Century\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century |title=Ageing in the Twenty-First Century |year=2012 |publisher= UNFPA}}</ref> Aging has occurred due to development which has enabled better nutrition, sanitation, health care, education and economic well-being. Consequently, fertility rates have continued to decline and life expectancy has risen. Life expectancy at birth is over 80 now in 33 countries. Aging is a \"global phenomenon\", that is occurring fastest in developing countries, including those with large youth populations, and poses social and economic challenges to the work which can be overcome with \"the right set of policies to equip individuals, families and societies to address these challenges and to reap its benefits\".<ref name=\"unfpa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/ageing|title=Ageing |publisher= UNFPA \u2013 United Nations Population Fund|date=|work=unfpa.org}}</ref>\n\nAs life expectancy rises and [[birth rates]] decline in developed countries, the [[median]] age rises accordingly.

While the effects on society are complex, there is a concern about the impact on health care demand.

The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, [[perennial plants]] and some simple animals are potentially [[biologically immortal]]. In the broader sense, aging can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing ([[cellular senescence]]) or to the population of a species ([[population ageing]]).\n\nIn humans, aging represents the accumulation of changes in a human being over time, encompassing [[Human body|physical]], [[psychological]], and social changes. Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world events and wisdom may expand. Aging is among the greatest known [[risk factor]]s for [[Aging-associated diseases|most human diseases]]: of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die from age-related causes.\n\nThe causes of aging are uncertain; current theories are assigned to the damage concept, whereby the accumulation of damage (such as [[DNA oxidation]]) may cause biological systems to fail, or to the programmed aging concept, whereby internal processes (such as [[DNA methylation]]) may cause aging. Programmed aging should not be confused with programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).\n\n== Aging versus immortality ==\n[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Immortal ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', a relative of the jellyfish]]\nHuman beings and members of other species, especially animals, have a tendency to develop aging.

When organisms restrict their diet, mTOR activity is reduced, which allows an increased level of autophagy. This recycles old or damaged cell parts, which increases longevity and decreases the chances of being obese. This is thought to prevent spikes of [[glucose]] concentration in the blood, leading to reduced insulin signalling. This has been linked to less mTOR activation as well.  Therefore, longevity has been connected to caloric restriction and insulin sensitivity inhibiting mTOR, which in turns allows autophagy to occur more frequently.  It may be that mTOR inhibition and autophagy reduce the effects of [[reactive oxygen species]] on the body, which damage DNA and other organic material, so longevity would be increased.<ref name=\"Johnson et al 2013\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature11861 |title=MTOR is a key modulator of aging and age-related disease |year=2013 |last1=Johnson |first1=Simon C. |last2=Rabinovitch |first2=Peter S. |last3=Kaeberlein |first3=Matt |journal=Nature |volume=493 |issue=7432 |pages=338\u201345 |pmid=23325216 |pmc=3687363|bibcode=2013Natur.493..338J }}</ref> In support of this contention are observations that several purported anti-aging remedies such as rapamycin, metformin, berberine, 2-deoxyglucose, vitamin D3, aspirin and resveratrol were shown to suppress mTOR signaling and concurrently to reduce constitutive level of oxidative DNA damage induced by endogenous oxidants as well as to enhance the rate of autophagy<ref>Halicka HD, Zhao H, Li J, Lee YS, Hsieh TC, Wu JM, Darzynkiewicz Z.

DePinho]] and his colleagues published research on mice where [[telomerase]] activity was first genetically removed. Then, after the mice had prematurely aged, they restored telomerase activity by reactivating the telomerase gene. As a result, the mice were rejuvenated: Shrivelled testes grew back to normal and the animals regained their fertility. Other organs, such as the spleen, liver, intestines and brain, recuperated from their degenerated state. \"[The finding] offers the possibility that normal human aging could be slowed by reawakening the enzyme in cells where it has stopped working\" says Ronald DePinho. However, activating telomerase in humans could potentially encourage the growth of tumours.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/news.2010.635 |title=Telomerase reverses ageing process |year=2010 |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |journal=Nature}}</ref>\n\n<!--The Bartke2011 reference has a lot of information on specific mutations which could be discussed here.-->\nMost known genetic interventions in ''C. elegans'' increase lifespan by 1.5 to 2.5-fold. {{as of|2009}}, the record for lifespan extension in C.

The age of an adult human is commonly measured in whole years since the day of birth. Arbitrary divisions set to mark periods of life may include: [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] (via [[Infant|infancy]], [[childhood]], [[preadolescence]], [[adolescence]]), [[Emerging adulthood and early adulthood|early adulthood]], [[Middle age|middle adulthood]], and [[Senior citizen|late adulthood]]. More casual terms may include \"teenagers\", \"[[Tween (demographic)|tweens]]\", \"twentysomething\", \"thirtysomething\", etc. as well as \"denarian\", \"vicenarian\", \"tricenarian\", \"quadragenarian\", etc.\n\nMost legal systems define a specific age for when an individual is allowed or obliged to do particular activities. These age specifications include [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], [[age of consent]], [[age of majority]], [[age of criminal responsibility]], [[marriageable age]], [[age of candidacy]], and [[mandatory retirement age]]. Admission to a movie for instance, may depend on age according to a [[motion picture rating system]]. A bus fare might be discounted for the young or old. Each nation, government and non-governmental organisation has different ways of classifying age. In other words, [[Chronology|chronological]] aging may be distinguished from \"social aging\" (cultural age-expectations of how people should act as they grow older) and \"biological aging\" (an organism's physical state as it ages).<ref>Phillips, Judith, Kristine Ajrouch, and Sarah Hillcoat-Nall\u00e9tamby (2010) ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology''.

Population aging has three possible causes: migration, longer [[life expectancy]] (decreased death rate) and decreased birth rate. Aging has a significant impact on society. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the [[age of majority]]), they are more likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights.<ref name=\"Vincent 2005\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00084.x |title=Understanding generations: Political economy and culture in an ageing society |year=2005 |last1=Vincent |first1=John A. |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=579\u201399 |pmid=16309437|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c8c9e3dcf54b1c9b7591e680ec964fc5c466367 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, one of the most significant population trends is aging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/population-ageing-and-development-0 |title=Population Ageing and Development |year=2002 |publisher= UNFPA}}</ref> Currently, over 11% of the world's current population are people aged 60 and older and the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) estimates that by 2050 that number will rise to approximately 22%.<ref name=\"Ageing in the Twenty-First Century\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century |title=Ageing in the Twenty-First Century |year=2012 |publisher= UNFPA}}</ref> Aging has occurred due to development which has enabled better nutrition, sanitation, health care, education and economic well-being. Consequently, fertility rates have continued to decline and life expectancy has risen. Life expectancy at birth is over 80 now in 33 countries. Aging is a \"global phenomenon\", that is occurring fastest in developing countries, including those with large youth populations, and poses social and economic challenges to the work which can be overcome with \"the right set of policies to equip individuals, families and societies to address these challenges and to reap its benefits\".<ref name=\"unfpa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/ageing|title=Ageing |publisher= UNFPA \u2013 United Nations Population Fund|date=|work=unfpa.org}}</ref>\n\nAs life expectancy rises and [[birth rates]] decline in developed countries, the [[median]] age rises accordingly.

While the effects on society are complex, there is a concern about the impact on health care demand.

The station got its call sign just after KFWA in [[Ogden, Utah]], and KFWC in [[San Bernardino]], both granted in February 1925.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/chrono1.html  A Chronology of AM Radio Broadcasting 1900-1960]</ref> Nevertheless, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] regularly used KFWB as a [[running gag]] in its productions.\n\nOn February 8, 1937, KFWB opened a new facility on the south end of the Warner Bros. lot. It included six large studios, one of which was a 500-seat theater, and a \"multi-manual pipe organ, built especially for broadcasting.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Advanced Features in New KFWB Plant|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Daily/RA-1937/RA-1937-Feb.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015|agency=Radio Daily|date=February 10, 1937}}</ref>\n\n''Bedtime for Sniffles'', a 1940 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon, produced by Warner Bros., and directed by [[Chuck Jones]], has [[Sniffles]] the mouse trying to stay awake for [[Santa Claus]], and a radio announcer signs off for the night identifying the station as KFWB.  Another cartoon of the same year, ''The Timid Toreador'', co-directed by [[Bob Clampett]], shows an announcer broadcasting on this station, although the action takes place in [[Mexico]]. The [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon for ''I've Got A Torch Song'' released in conjunction with ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' has KFWB written on the microphones in the scenes of the torch singers.\n\nIn 1932, a KFWB personality, Al Jarvis, began playing recorded music, a rarity on radio at the time, where music was usually performed live.  He called his show \"The World's Largest [[Make Believe Ballroom]].\"  In 1946, KFWB brought in two [[disc jockey]]s from [[New York City]]: Maurice Hart of [[WBBR|WNEW]], whose morning [[drive time]] show ''Start the Day Right'' was described as \"Words and Music Straight from the Hart,\" and [[Martin Block]], who shortened Jarvis' title to \"The Make-Believe Ballroom.\" In those days, the DJs selected their own music, either from KFWB's extensive record library, or new songs brought to them by \"[[song plugger]]s.\" Old and new, vocal and instrumental were mixed together to the disc jockey's choice.  \n\nIn 1950, KFWB was sold to its long-time general manager, Harry Maizlish.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taishoff|first=Sol|year=1951|title=Letter to Harry Maizlish, September 27, 1950|journal=Broadcasting Yearbook|pages=83|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|quote=We rejoice with your host of friends in congratulating you on the acquisition of KFWB by your new company....

Under new owners [[Collier's Weekly|Crowell-Collier Broadcasting]], program director Chuck Blore pioneered the [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] format on AM 980, calling it ''Channel 98 Color Radio''. KFWB became one of the most listened-to stations in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Southland]] and a leader in the Top 40 format around the country. The air staff during the glory days included [[Roger Christian (songwriter)]],   [[Bill Ballance]], [[B. Mitchel Reed]], Bruce Hayes, Al Jarvis, Joe Yocam, Elliot Field, [[Ted Quillin]] and Gene Weed. Hourly updates were delivered by a staff of respected newscasters, including Cleve Herrmann, Charles Arlington, John Babcock, Beach Rogers, Mike Henry, Hal Goodwin, [[Al Wiman]], Bill Angel, J. Paul Huddleston and Jackson King. \n\nIn the mid-1960s, KFWB was overtaken by rival [[KRDC (AM)|KRLA]]. Then KRLA was put in second place by the launch of \"[[Boss Radio]]\" at [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]], and this relegated KFWB to the position of the third-place Top 40 music station in the L.A. market.\n\n===All-news radio===\nIn 1966, KFWB was purchased by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]]. The previous year, Westinghouse had successfully launched an [[all-news radio]] format on [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in [[New York City]], after that station had been playing Top 40 music. On March 11, 1968, KFWB ended its Top 40 era, and was relaunched as an all-news radio station. The station promoted itself with the slogan, \"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\", as first used by WINS, although KFWB's format used a 30-minute news cycle. Like WINS and co-owned [[KYW (AM)|KYW]] [[Philadelphia]], KFWB had a running [[Teleprinter|Teletype]] [[sound effect]] in the background during regular newscasts.\n\nAlso in Spring 1968, another Los Angeles radio station jumped into the all-news format, [[KNX (AM)|KNX]], owned by [[CBS Radio]]. For the next 27 years, the two stations would be competitors, airing television commercials and sponsoring billboards, in an effort to be LA's top radio news outlet.\n\nIn 1995, Westinghouse bought the [[CBS Corporation]], merging the broadcast operations of the two companies, with KFWB coming under the ownership of [[CBS Radio]].  For the first several years after their parent companies merged, KFWB and KNX continued to operate separately, as friendly rivals.\n\nIn addition to being an all-news station, KFWB also had sports play-by-play contracts. It previously aired [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball games and many [[National Football League]] games from [[NFL on Westwood One|Westwood One]]. The NFL broadcasts stopped after the 2007 [[Pro Bowl]], later switching to [[AM 790]] [[KABC (AM)|KABC]]. With that, the slogan \"all news, all the time\" returned. However, in 2008, the NFL broadcasts returned for a brief period.\n\nBeginning in 2008, KNX and KFWB were jointly branded as \"CBSNewsRadioLA.\" The CBSNewsRadioLA brand was used for [[simulcast]]ing special programs and for marketing to advertisers.<ref>http://worldfamouscbs.com/</ref> In addition, there were no longer separate field reporters for KNX and KFWB.  CBSNewsRadioLA reporters filed stories for both stations.\n\nAlso in the 2009 season, KFWB began broadcasting some weekday baseball games of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], although the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] remained the Angels-owned [[KLAA (AM)|KLAA]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/ LA Radio News]</ref> On August 13, 2009, CBS announced the NBA's [[Los Angeles Clippers]] had signed a multi-year broadcast rights pact, with KFWB carrying every Clippers contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/clippers/news/breakingnews090813.html|title=Clippers and KFWB 980 AM Enter Into Multi-Year Radio Broadcast Agreement|website=Los Angeles Clippers|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver time, KFWB's ratings gradually dropped. A number of factors may have been involved. KFWB is powered at 5,000 watts, while KNX is powered at 50,000 watts. In its final months as an all-news station, KFWB added more news about the movie and television industries, since many people in the Los Angeles market are employed in those fields.  But the ratings continued to fall.\n\n===Moving to news/talk===\n[[File:Kfwb.jpg|thumb|left|Logo as \"News/Talk 980\"]]\nOn September 8, 2009, the station adopted a [[news-talk]] format, limiting the all-news blocks to AM and PM drive times. The station added [[radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] shows, including [[Dave Ramsey]], [[Laura Ingraham]], [[Michael Smerconish]] and Dr. [[Laura Schlessinger]] (who moved from longtime flagship [[KFI]]).<ref>http://www.ocregister.com/articles/kfwb-news-laura-2523798-talk-ingraham</ref>  In 2011, Dr. Laura's show was dropped when she moved from broadcast radio to [[Sirius XM]] Satellite Radio. Dave Ramsey shifted to 11am-2pm and the station added motivational speaker [[Les Brown (speaker)|Les Brown]] to its afternoon lineup. Brown left the station in 2012. Ramsey's show was discontinued in 2014. By the summer of 2014, KFWB's weekday line-up included: LA's Morning News with Penny Griego and Phil Hulett; Money 101 with Bob McCormick; \"As We See It\" with Phil Hulett and friends; LA's Afternoon News with Maggie McKay and Michael Shappee; and The Amani & Eytan Show from [[NBC Sports Radio]].\n\nIn the early 2010s, the station was authorized by the FCC to boost its power to 50,000 watts, using a [[directional antenna]] involving multiple towers.  But the power increase was short-lived.  A few years later, new owners returned to KFWB's original 5,000 watt output, so the station could broadcast from a single [[omni-directional antenna|non-directional antenna]] and take up less acreage of valuable Los Angeles real estate.\n\nOn November 2, 2011, CBS Radio placed KFWB into a trust headed by Diane Sutter, under the name \"The KFWB Asset Trust.\" This was due to CBS Corp.'s ownership limitations after the network bought [[KCAL-TV]] in 2002.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/las-newstalk-kfwb-980-goes-into-a-trust-under-new-gm-valerie-blackburn L.A.\u2019s news/talk KFWB (980) goes into a trust, under new GM Valerie Blackburn] - (released November 2, 2011)</ref>\n\n===Switch to sports===\n[[File:KFWB The Beast 980.jpg|thumb|right|Logo as \"The Beast 980\"]]\nOn September 22, 2014, KFWB became a [[CBS Sports Radio]] [[Network affiliate]], cancelling all news blocks and general interest talk programs.

The Beast 980\u2019s weekday lineup also featured [[Jim Rome]] and [[Fred Roggin]]. Sports updates were provided during the day mostly by Sam Farber, Amy Bender and Ted Sobel, with Hall-of-Fame [[USC Trojans]] broadcaster [[Pete Arbogast]] providing sports updates and as a fill-in host from time to time. The Beast 980 was the flagship radio station of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the [[LA Galaxy]] soccer team of the [[MLS]]. The Beast 980 also carried [[National Football League|NFL]] games, [[NCAA]] [[college football]] games and NCAA basketball games.\n\n===South Asian programming===\nOn January 5, 2016, it was reported that KFWB was in the process of being sold to an operator of foreign-language radio stations.<ref name=ladn-kfwbsale>{{cite news|last1=Hoffarth|first1=Tom|title=Radio home of Clippers, KFWB \u2018The Beast 980\u2019, is sold; NBA team may need new station|url=http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20160105/radio-home-of-clippers-kfwb-the-beast-980-is-sold-nba-team-may-need-new-station|accessdate=January 6, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> A filing with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] stated that the station would be acquired by Principle Broadcasting, a company backed by Mercury Capital Partners, for $15 million.

Studios, which is now [[KTLA]], at 5800 [[Sunset Boulevard]]. One of the two original towers still stands prominently out front. Due to [[radio frequency|RF]] interference getting into the movie studio's \"talkies\" sound equipment, the transmitter was moved in 1928 to the roof of the Warner Theater, now the [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]], at 6423 Hollywood Blvd. Eventually the studios were also moved to the Warner Theater. Those two towers are still standing. \n\nYears later, when KFWB was sold to KFWB Broadcasting Co. (Harry Maizlish), the studios moved to 6419 Hollywood Blvd. (now demolished), and the transmitter moved to a site near La Cienega and Rodeo Blvd., about three blocks south of the KECA/KABC studio/transmitter site. To make way for the construction of a [[Federal Employees' Distributing Company|FEDCO]] membership department store, in July 1958 the transmitter moved to its present location, diplexed with 570 [[KLAC]] in East LA. The studios moved in 1977 to 6230 Yucca St., also in Hollywood. \n\nIn June 2005, KFWB moved into new studios on Wilshire Boulevard in the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Miracle Mile]] district, sharing facilities with [[Entercom]]'s other L.A. stations, [[KNX (AM)|KNX]], [[KTWV]] and [[KRTH]]. Today, the studios and offices are on Barham Boulevard, near the [[Universal City, California|Universal City]] complex.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Herb Rosenblum.

Animation]] regularly used KFWB as a [[running gag]] in its productions.\n\nOn February 8, 1937, KFWB opened a new facility on the south end of the Warner Bros. lot. It included six large studios, one of which was a 500-seat theater, and a \"multi-manual pipe organ, built especially for broadcasting.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Advanced Features in New KFWB Plant|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Daily/RA-1937/RA-1937-Feb.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015|agency=Radio Daily|date=February 10, 1937}}</ref>\n\n''Bedtime for Sniffles'', a 1940 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon, produced by Warner Bros., and directed by [[Chuck Jones]], has [[Sniffles]] the mouse trying to stay awake for [[Santa Claus]], and a radio announcer signs off for the night identifying the station as KFWB.  Another cartoon of the same year, ''The Timid Toreador'', co-directed by [[Bob Clampett]], shows an announcer broadcasting on this station, although the action takes place in [[Mexico]]. The [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon for ''I've Got A Torch Song'' released in conjunction with ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' has KFWB written on the microphones in the scenes of the torch singers.\n\nIn 1932, a KFWB personality, Al Jarvis, began playing recorded music, a rarity on radio at the time, where music was usually performed live.  He called his show \"The World's Largest [[Make Believe Ballroom]].\"  In 1946, KFWB brought in two [[disc jockey]]s from [[New York City]]: Maurice Hart of [[WBBR|WNEW]], whose morning [[drive time]] show ''Start the Day Right'' was described as \"Words and Music Straight from the Hart,\" and [[Martin Block]], who shortened Jarvis' title to \"The Make-Believe Ballroom.\" In those days, the DJs selected their own music, either from KFWB's extensive record library, or new songs brought to them by \"[[song plugger]]s.\" Old and new, vocal and instrumental were mixed together to the disc jockey's choice.  \n\nIn 1950, KFWB was sold to its long-time general manager, Harry Maizlish.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taishoff|first=Sol|year=1951|title=Letter to Harry Maizlish, September 27, 1950|journal=Broadcasting Yearbook|pages=83|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|quote=We rejoice with your host of friends in congratulating you on the acquisition of KFWB by your new company....

Under new owners [[Collier's Weekly|Crowell-Collier Broadcasting]], program director Chuck Blore pioneered the [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] format on AM 980, calling it ''Channel 98 Color Radio''. KFWB became one of the most listened-to stations in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Southland]] and a leader in the Top 40 format around the country. The air staff during the glory days included [[Roger Christian (songwriter)]],   [[Bill Ballance]], [[B. Mitchel Reed]], Bruce Hayes, Al Jarvis, Joe Yocam, Elliot Field, [[Ted Quillin]] and Gene Weed. Hourly updates were delivered by a staff of respected newscasters, including Cleve Herrmann, Charles Arlington, John Babcock, Beach Rogers, Mike Henry, Hal Goodwin, [[Al Wiman]], Bill Angel, J. Paul Huddleston and Jackson King. \n\nIn the mid-1960s, KFWB was overtaken by rival [[KRDC (AM)|KRLA]]. Then KRLA was put in second place by the launch of \"[[Boss Radio]]\" at [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]], and this relegated KFWB to the position of the third-place Top 40 music station in the L.A. market.\n\n===All-news radio===\nIn 1966, KFWB was purchased by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]]. The previous year, Westinghouse had successfully launched an [[all-news radio]] format on [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in [[New York City]], after that station had been playing Top 40 music. On March 11, 1968, KFWB ended its Top 40 era, and was relaunched as an all-news radio station. The station promoted itself with the slogan, \"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\", as first used by WINS, although KFWB's format used a 30-minute news cycle. Like WINS and co-owned [[KYW (AM)|KYW]] [[Philadelphia]], KFWB had a running [[Teleprinter|Teletype]] [[sound effect]] in the background during regular newscasts.\n\nAlso in Spring 1968, another Los Angeles radio station jumped into the all-news format, [[KNX (AM)|KNX]], owned by [[CBS Radio]]. For the next 27 years, the two stations would be competitors, airing television commercials and sponsoring billboards, in an effort to be LA's top radio news outlet.\n\nIn 1995, Westinghouse bought the [[CBS Corporation]], merging the broadcast operations of the two companies, with KFWB coming under the ownership of [[CBS Radio]].  For the first several years after their parent companies merged, KFWB and KNX continued to operate separately, as friendly rivals.\n\nIn addition to being an all-news station, KFWB also had sports play-by-play contracts. It previously aired [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball games and many [[National Football League]] games from [[NFL on Westwood One|Westwood One]]. The NFL broadcasts stopped after the 2007 [[Pro Bowl]], later switching to [[AM 790]] [[KABC (AM)|KABC]]. With that, the slogan \"all news, all the time\" returned. However, in 2008, the NFL broadcasts returned for a brief period.\n\nBeginning in 2008, KNX and KFWB were jointly branded as \"CBSNewsRadioLA.\" The CBSNewsRadioLA brand was used for [[simulcast]]ing special programs and for marketing to advertisers.<ref>http://worldfamouscbs.com/</ref> In addition, there were no longer separate field reporters for KNX and KFWB.  CBSNewsRadioLA reporters filed stories for both stations.\n\nAlso in the 2009 season, KFWB began broadcasting some weekday baseball games of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], although the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] remained the Angels-owned [[KLAA (AM)|KLAA]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/ LA Radio News]</ref> On August 13, 2009, CBS announced the NBA's [[Los Angeles Clippers]] had signed a multi-year broadcast rights pact, with KFWB carrying every Clippers contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/clippers/news/breakingnews090813.html|title=Clippers and KFWB 980 AM Enter Into Multi-Year Radio Broadcast Agreement|website=Los Angeles Clippers|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver time, KFWB's ratings gradually dropped. A number of factors may have been involved. KFWB is powered at 5,000 watts, while KNX is powered at 50,000 watts. In its final months as an all-news station, KFWB added more news about the movie and television industries, since many people in the Los Angeles market are employed in those fields.  But the ratings continued to fall.\n\n===Moving to news/talk===\n[[File:Kfwb.jpg|thumb|left|Logo as \"News/Talk 980\"]]\nOn September 8, 2009, the station adopted a [[news-talk]] format, limiting the all-news blocks to AM and PM drive times. The station added [[radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] shows, including [[Dave Ramsey]], [[Laura Ingraham]], [[Michael Smerconish]] and Dr. [[Laura Schlessinger]] (who moved from longtime flagship [[KFI]]).<ref>http://www.ocregister.com/articles/kfwb-news-laura-2523798-talk-ingraham</ref>  In 2011, Dr. Laura's show was dropped when she moved from broadcast radio to [[Sirius XM]] Satellite Radio. Dave Ramsey shifted to 11am-2pm and the station added motivational speaker [[Les Brown (speaker)|Les Brown]] to its afternoon lineup. Brown left the station in 2012. Ramsey's show was discontinued in 2014. By the summer of 2014, KFWB's weekday line-up included: LA's Morning News with Penny Griego and Phil Hulett; Money 101 with Bob McCormick; \"As We See It\" with Phil Hulett and friends; LA's Afternoon News with Maggie McKay and Michael Shappee; and The Amani & Eytan Show from [[NBC Sports Radio]].\n\nIn the early 2010s, the station was authorized by the FCC to boost its power to 50,000 watts, using a [[directional antenna]] involving multiple towers.  But the power increase was short-lived.  A few years later, new owners returned to KFWB's original 5,000 watt output, so the station could broadcast from a single [[omni-directional antenna|non-directional antenna]] and take up less acreage of valuable Los Angeles real estate.\n\nOn November 2, 2011, CBS Radio placed KFWB into a trust headed by Diane Sutter, under the name \"The KFWB Asset Trust.\" This was due to CBS Corp.'s ownership limitations after the network bought [[KCAL-TV]] in 2002.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/las-newstalk-kfwb-980-goes-into-a-trust-under-new-gm-valerie-blackburn L.A.\u2019s news/talk KFWB (980) goes into a trust, under new GM Valerie Blackburn] - (released November 2, 2011)</ref>\n\n===Switch to sports===\n[[File:KFWB The Beast 980.jpg|thumb|right|Logo as \"The Beast 980\"]]\nOn September 22, 2014, KFWB became a [[CBS Sports Radio]] [[Network affiliate]], cancelling all news blocks and general interest talk programs.

The Beast 980\u2019s weekday lineup also featured [[Jim Rome]] and [[Fred Roggin]]. Sports updates were provided during the day mostly by Sam Farber, Amy Bender and Ted Sobel, with Hall-of-Fame [[USC Trojans]] broadcaster [[Pete Arbogast]] providing sports updates and as a fill-in host from time to time. The Beast 980 was the flagship radio station of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the [[LA Galaxy]] soccer team of the [[MLS]]. The Beast 980 also carried [[National Football League|NFL]] games, [[NCAA]] [[college football]] games and NCAA basketball games.\n\n===South Asian programming===\nOn January 5, 2016, it was reported that KFWB was in the process of being sold to an operator of foreign-language radio stations.<ref name=ladn-kfwbsale>{{cite news|last1=Hoffarth|first1=Tom|title=Radio home of Clippers, KFWB \u2018The Beast 980\u2019, is sold; NBA team may need new station|url=http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20160105/radio-home-of-clippers-kfwb-the-beast-980-is-sold-nba-team-may-need-new-station|accessdate=January 6, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> A filing with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] stated that the station would be acquired by Principle Broadcasting, a company backed by Mercury Capital Partners, for $15 million.

He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name ''cassiopeium'' (or later ''cassiopium'') for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.\n\nLutetium is not a particularly abundant element, although it is significantly more common than [[silver]] in the earth's crust.

He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium.

[[Thorium]] precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in [[nitric acid]] that excludes one of the main components, [[cerium]], whose oxide is insoluble in HNO<sub>3</sub>. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with [[ammonium nitrate]] by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation.

It lies just outside the urban core of the Halifax Regional Municipality.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Halifax Regional Municipality}}\nFirst settled in August 1749 by Captain [[John Gorham (military officer)|John Gorham]], acting on orders from Governor [[Edward Cornwallis, 5th Earl Cornwallis|Edward Cornwallis]] to establish a military fort named [[Fort Sackville (Nova Scotia)|Fort Sackville]] (The community was named after [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville]].<ref>https://novascotia.ca/archives/virtual/places/page.asp?ID=600</ref>) Lower Sackville is now one of the fastest growing communities in Nova Scotia, and contains a mix of residential and commercial development in the Sackville River valley, immediately north of the former town of [[Bedford, Nova Scotia|Bedford]].  As the community grew, the oak trees that lined the main drive were cut down one by one due to poor urban planning, and as more homes were desired the farmlands deceased to make way for further urbanization.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nBefore amalgamation into the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996, Lower Sackville was an unincorporated part of [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] (2001 pop.: 27,941).  This area of HRM experienced a 7% population growth rate between 1996-2001 (2006 pop.: approx. 35,000). In the 1950s and 1960s it was a destination for Haligonians seeking entertainment at the [[drive-in theater]], WW2 bomber plane ice cream attraction and Sackville Downs [[harness racing]] track which provided entertainment until it closed in 1986.\n\nA result of its unincorporated status before 1996, Lower Sackville and adjacent unincorporated communities such as [[Middle Sackville, Nova Scotia|Middle Sackville]] and [[Upper Sackville, Nova Scotia|Upper Sackville]] did not benefit from appropriate planning and are examples of [[urban sprawl]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  The community's growth reflects its central location, near both Halifax and Dartmouth, with easy access to [[Nova Scotia Highway 102|Highway 102]], [[Nova Scotia Highway 101|Highway 101]] and [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]].  Proximity to downtown Halifax and Burnside and Bayers Lake Industrial Parks gives the suburbs of Lower Sackville the advantages of employment opportunities and services of a larger city, and is typical of most commuter communities experiencing growth in North America.\n\nLower Sackville has experienced ribbon/strip-style commercial development along [[Nova Scotia Trunk 1|Trunk 1]] since the 1960s.  Current retail chains include [[Sobeys]], [[Atlantic Superstore]], [[Canadian Tire]], Cleve's Sporting Goods, [[Dollarama]] and [[Giant Tiger]].  There are numerous independent retailers located in this area as well.  Most of the restaurants in the area are of the [[fast food]] or family dining variety, in addition to others offering Chinese-Canadian food and pizza.\nLower Sackville has always displayed an abundance of community spirit, and excelled within the HRM as a strong leader of excellence in sports as well as academics.\n\n==Sports==\nRecreational pursuits in the community revolve around sports fields at local schools and parks, as well as the Sackville Sports Stadium, which is equipped with two swimming pools, gymnasium, [[curling]] rink, and one of Lower Sackville's two ice [[hockey]] arenas.  The majority of Lower Sackville's suburbs were built in the 1970s on the southern edge of First Lake which offers outdoor recreational opportunities.  The Bedford-Sackville Connector Greenway is a crushed gravel-covered trail running beside the Sackville River from the intersection of Cobequid Road and Sackville Drive to Bedford Place Mall.  Prior to the opening of the trail in 2006, there was no easy way to walk from Lower Sackville to Bedford. A provincial park reserve borders the northern edge of the community at Second Lake.\n\n==Education==\nThe community hosts two high schools: [[Sackville High School]] and [[Millwood High School]], along with a community-run museum, [[Fultz House]]. There are 19 elementary schools located in and around Lower Sackville.<ref>http://www.lowersackville.com/lowersackvilleschools.html</ref>\n\n==Districts of Lower Sackville==\n\nThe following are the districts of Lower Sackville, their geographical location, and/or main road:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.halifax.ca/municipalclerk/documents/District15large.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112021352/http://www.halifax.ca/municipalclerk/documents/District15large.pdf |archive-date=2016-11-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*East Sackville - First Lake Drive\n*North Sackville - Stokil Drive and Armcrest\n*West Sackville - Riverside Drive\n*South Sackville - Between the lower half of Sackville Drive and Glendale Drive, also includes Chandler Peninsula\n*Downtown - Upper half of Sackville Drive, close to Beaver Bank Road\n*Olde Sackville - Old Sackville Road and Riverside Estates\n*Sunnyvale - Sunnyvale Crescent\n*Sackville Estates - Below Century Park, connected to Millwood\n*Seawood - Seawood Avenue\n*Walker Area - Walker Avenue\n*Industrial Park - Lower half of Cobequid Road and Glendale Avenue\n*Cobequid - Upper half of Cobequid Road\n*Stonemount - Stonemount Drive\n\nSome neighbourhoods of Lower Sackville are also known by their tendency to use street names starting with the same letter:\n*\"S\" Section: Smokey Dr, Stokil Dr, Sampson Dr, Saratoga Dr, Saturn Dr, Spinner Cres, Sappire Cres\n*\"N\" Section: Nordic Cres, Neilly Dr, Nappan Dr, Newcombe Dr, Nictaux Dr\n*\"L\" Section: Lennox Dr, Lumsden Cres, Lynville Dr, Lydgate Dr\n*\"C\" Section: Cavalier Dr, Cavendish Dr, Cartier Cres, Cabot Cres, Crimson Dr\n*\"P\" Section: Polara Dr, Polara Ct, Phoenix Cres\n*\"Q\" Section: Quaker Cres, Quinn Dr, Queens Ct\n*\"R\" Section: Rogers Dr, Rankin Dr, Riverside Dr, Rothesay Ct\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Charles Fenerty]], inventor of [[newsprint]] made from [[wood pulp]].\n* [[Brad Marchand]], [[NHL]] player for the [[Boston Bruins]].

It lies just outside the urban core of the Halifax Regional Municipality.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Halifax Regional Municipality}}\nFirst settled in August 1749 by Captain [[John Gorham (military officer)|John Gorham]], acting on orders from Governor [[Edward Cornwallis, 5th Earl Cornwallis|Edward Cornwallis]] to establish a military fort named [[Fort Sackville (Nova Scotia)|Fort Sackville]] (The community was named after [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville]].<ref>https://novascotia.ca/archives/virtual/places/page.asp?ID=600</ref>) Lower Sackville is now one of the fastest growing communities in Nova Scotia, and contains a mix of residential and commercial development in the Sackville River valley, immediately north of the former town of [[Bedford, Nova Scotia|Bedford]].  As the community grew, the oak trees that lined the main drive were cut down one by one due to poor urban planning, and as more homes were desired the farmlands deceased to make way for further urbanization.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nBefore amalgamation into the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996, Lower Sackville was an unincorporated part of [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] (2001 pop.: 27,941).  This area of HRM experienced a 7% population growth rate between 1996-2001 (2006 pop.: approx. 35,000). In the 1950s and 1960s it was a destination for Haligonians seeking entertainment at the [[drive-in theater]], WW2 bomber plane ice cream attraction and Sackville Downs [[harness racing]] track which provided entertainment until it closed in 1986.\n\nA result of its unincorporated status before 1996, Lower Sackville and adjacent unincorporated communities such as [[Middle Sackville, Nova Scotia|Middle Sackville]] and [[Upper Sackville, Nova Scotia|Upper Sackville]] did not benefit from appropriate planning and are examples of [[urban sprawl]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  The community's growth reflects its central location, near both Halifax and Dartmouth, with easy access to [[Nova Scotia Highway 102|Highway 102]], [[Nova Scotia Highway 101|Highway 101]] and [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]].  Proximity to downtown Halifax and Burnside and Bayers Lake Industrial Parks gives the suburbs of Lower Sackville the advantages of employment opportunities and services of a larger city, and is typical of most commuter communities experiencing growth in North America.\n\nLower Sackville has experienced ribbon/strip-style commercial development along [[Nova Scotia Trunk 1|Trunk 1]] since the 1960s.  Current retail chains include [[Sobeys]], [[Atlantic Superstore]], [[Canadian Tire]], Cleve's Sporting Goods, [[Dollarama]] and [[Giant Tiger]].  There are numerous independent retailers located in this area as well.  Most of the restaurants in the area are of the [[fast food]] or family dining variety, in addition to others offering Chinese-Canadian food and pizza.\nLower Sackville has always displayed an abundance of community spirit, and excelled within the HRM as a strong leader of excellence in sports as well as academics.\n\n==Sports==\nRecreational pursuits in the community revolve around sports fields at local schools and parks, as well as the [[Sackville Sports Stadium]], which is equipped with two swimming pools, gymnasium, [[curling]] rink, and one of Lower Sackville's two ice [[hockey]] arenas.  The majority of Lower Sackville's suburbs were built in the 1970s on the southern edge of First Lake which offers outdoor recreational opportunities.  The Bedford-Sackville Connector Greenway is a crushed gravel covered trail running beside the Sackville River from the intersection of Cobequid Road and Sackville Drive to Bedford Place Mall.  Prior to the opening of the trail in 2006, there was no easy way to walk from Lower Sackville to Bedford. A provincial park reserve borders the northern edge of the community at Second Lake.\n\n==Education==\nThe community hosts two high schools: [[Sackville High School]] and [[Millwood High School]], along with a community-run museum, [[Fultz House]]. There are 19 elementary schools located in and around Lower Sackville.<ref>http://www.lowersackville.com/lowersackvilleschools.html</ref>\n\n==Districts of Lower Sackville==\n\nThe following are the districts of Lower Sackville, their geographical location, and/or main road:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.halifax.ca/municipalclerk/documents/District15large.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112021352/http://www.halifax.ca/municipalclerk/documents/District15large.pdf |archive-date=2016-11-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*East Sackville - First Lake Drive\n*North Sackville - Stokil Drive and Armcrest\n*West Sackville - Riverside Drive\n*South Sackville - Between the lower half of Sackville Drive and Glendale Drive, also includes Chandler Peninsula\n*Downtown - Upper half of Sackville Drive, close to Beaver Bank Road\n*Olde Sackville - Old Sackville Road and Riverside Estates\n*Sunnyvale - Sunnyvale Crescent\n*Sackville Estates - Below Century Park, connected to Millwood\n*Seawood - Seawood Avenue\n*Walker Area - Walker Avenue\n*Industrial Park - Lower half of Cobequid Road and Glendale Avenue\n*Cobequid - Upper half of Cobequid Road\n*Stonemount - Stonemount Drive\n\nSome neighbourhoods of Lower Sackville are also known by their tendency to use street names starting with the same letter:\n*\"S\" Section: Smokey Dr, Stokil Dr, Sampson Dr, Saratoga Dr, Saturn Dr, Spinner Cres, Sappire Cres\n*\"N\" Section: Nordic Cres, Neilly Dr, Nappan Dr, Newcombe Dr, Nictaux Dr\n*\"L\" Section: Lennox Dr, Lumsden Cres, Lynville Dr, Lydgate Dr\n*\"C\" Section: Cavalier Dr, Cavendish Dr, Cartier Cres, Cabot Cres, Crimson Dr\n*\"P\" Section: Polara Dr, Polara Ct, Phoenix Cres\n*\"Q\" Section: Quaker Cres, Quinn Dr, Queens Ct\n*\"R\" Section: Rogers Dr, Rankin Dr, Riverside Dr, Rothesay Ct\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Charles Fenerty]], inventor of [[newsprint]] made from [[wood pulp]].\n* [[Brad Marchand]], [[NHL]] player for the [[Boston Bruins]].

The airfield quickly fell into disrepair and grass grew on the former runways.{{citation needed|reason=that there were actual runways rather than a field|date=March 2019}}\n\n===The beginnings in the 1930s and 1940s===\n[[File:Dublin Airport 1940 terminal building.jpg|thumb|The original [[International style (architecture)|international style]] passenger terminal, completed in 1940]]\nIn 1936, the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] established a new civil airline, [[Aer Lingus]], which began operating from the [[Military airbase|military aerodrome]], [[Casement Aerodrome]], at [[Baldonnel, Ireland|Baldonnel]] to the southwest of [[Dublin]]. A decision was made that a civil airport should replace Baldonnel as Dublin's airport.  The former Collinstown site, extended into the neighbouring townlands of Rock and Corballis, was chosen.\n\nWork on the new airport began in 1937. By the end of 1939, a grass airfield surface, internal roads, car parks and electrical power and lighting were set up. The inaugural flight from Dublin took place on 19 January 1940 to [[Liverpool]]. In August 1938, work began on a new [[airport terminal]] building. The terminal building was designed by architect Desmond FitzGerald, brother of politician [[Garret FitzGerald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2010/1937-dublin-airport/|title=1937 \u2013 Dublin Airport \u2013 Architecture of Fingal \u2013 Archiseek.com|work=Archiseek.com|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=22 January 2010}}</ref> FitzGerald, who had designed an airport terminal as part of his college studies, led a team of architects that also included Kevin Barry, Daith\u00ed Hanley, Charles Aliaga Kelly, Dermot O'Toole and Harry Robson. The terminal building opened in early 1941, with its design heavily influenced by the tiered structure of the luxury ocean liners of the time. The terminal was awarded the Triennial Gold Medal of the Royal Hibernian Institute of Architects in 1942 and is today a listed building.\n[[File:Dublin Airport (5997469039).jpg|thumbnail|An [[Aer Lingus]] [[DC-3]] plane at Dublin Airport's original Terminal 1 in May 1950.]]\n\nDue to [[World War II]], which was known as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]] in Ireland, services were severely restricted at Dublin Airport until late 1945. The only international scheduled routes operated during this time were by Aer Lingus to Liverpool (and for a period to [[Manchester]]'s [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]]). The end of the war meant the beginning of a major expansion in services at the airport. Aer Lingus resumed its London service to Croydon in November 1945. In 1947, [[KLM]] started the first European flights to Dublin with a service to [[Amsterdam]]. Three new concrete runways were completed in 1948, and in 1950 - after ten years in operation - the airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/about-us/did-you-know/history|title=History|website=www.dublinairport.com|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Expanding in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThroughout the 1950s Dublin Airport expanded with virtually uninterrupted traffic growth. Runway extensions and terminal enhancements were carried out to deal with the influx of traffic and passengers. New airlines began serving the airport also. These included [[British European Airways]], [[Sabena]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|BKS]].\n\nIn 1958, a new transatlantic service was started by Aer Lingus via Shannon Airport. By the mid 1950s, it was clear that the original terminal building was too small to cope with growing passenger numbers. A new North Terminal was opened in June 1959. Originally, the plan was that North Terminal would handle all US and European flights, but instead it became the arrivals terminal for all Dublin Airport passengers, while the original passenger terminal was used for departures.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the number of scheduled carriers continued to grow. By the close of the 1960s, a sizeable number of [[Boeing 737]]s, [[BAC One-Eleven]]s, [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]]s were using the airport regularly. To cope with larger aircraft in the late 1960s new departure gate piers were added close to the old terminal to cope with larger aircraft.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> These piers would subsequently be connected to Terminal 1. During 1969, the airport handled 1,737,151 passengers.\n\nThe advent of [[wide-body aircraft]] posed opportunities and challenges for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above [[O'Connell Street]] in Dublin on [[Saint Patrick's Day]]; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To cope with this, a new \u00a310 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> The growth which was anticipated at Dublin's airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.\n\n[[File:Ryanair (EI-CCW), Dublin, July 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Two of the airport's largest operators side-by-side, a [[Ryanair]] [[BAC 1-11]] (front) and an Aer Lingus [[Boeing 737]] (rear) in 1993]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BDY), Dublin, July 1992 (01).jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-200 and a [[Ryanair]] BAC-111 in July 1992]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-ASI), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 747 in May 1994]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BXB), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-400 and a British Airways ATR 42]]\n\n===Continuing in the 1980s and 1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1983 Aer Lingus opened its 'Aer Lingus Commuter' division<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerlingus.com/media/pdfs/AL_Precourse_Workbook_January%202017_LR_FA.pdf|title=Online pre-course Workbook, Version 2, January 2017|website=Aer Lingus|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> which took delivery of [[Short Brothers|Shorts]], [[Saab AB]] and [[Fokker]] [[turboprop]] aircraft to open regular daily domestic services to and from Ireland's smaller regional airports for the first time, as well as to serve existing routes to smaller regional airports in the United Kingdom. At various stages of its operations, flights were operated to several Irish regional airports to feed passengers into Aer Lingus's international network. These domestic destinations included [[Cork Airport]], [[Shannon Airport]], [[Kerry Airport]], [[Galway Airport]], [[Ireland West Airport Knock]], [[Waterford Airport]], [[Sligo Airport]] and [[City of Derry Airport]]. Aer Lingus Commuter has since been re-absorbed into the main company. The domestic routes, with the exception of Dublin-Shannon, were taken over by Aer Arann. Most of these routes have since been discontinued as the development of the motorway network in Ireland has resulted in significant reductions in travelling time by road. Aer Lingus has continued with the remaining Dublin\u2013UK flights.\n\nDuring the 1980s, major competition, especially on the Dublin\u2013London routes, resulted in passenger numbers swelling to 5.1 million in 1989. In the same year a new {{convert|8650|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} runway and a state-of-the-art air traffic control centre were opened. Dublin Airport continued to expand rapidly in the 1990s. Pier A, which had been the first extension to the old terminal building, was significantly extended. A new Pier C, complete with [[Jet bridge|air bridges]], was built and as soon as this was completed, work commenced to extend it to double its capacity. The ground floor of the original terminal building was returned to passenger service after many years to provide additional departure gates. Pier D, completed in October 2007, is a dedicated low-fares boarding area and provides 14 quick turn-around stands and departure gates; these are not served by air bridges.\n\n===The Bilateral Air Transport Agreement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn 1993, a major milestone for the airport was the signing of a new United States \u2013 Ireland [[Bilateral Air Transport Agreement|bilateral agreement]] which allowed airlines to operate some direct transatlantic services for the first time to/from Dublin Airport instead of touching down en route at Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. (Shannon had once been a major transatlantic refuelling stop for pre-jet aircraft, and this agreement was designed to protect the interests of the Shannon region when modern jets no longer required a refuelling stop and Shannon saw a fall-off in traffic.) Airlines still had to provide an equal number of flights either to or through Shannon as to Dublin. A gradual further watering down of Shannon's so-called 'stopover' status came into effect in November 2006 when more direct flights to Dublin were allowed. The stopover requirement disappeared completely in 2008. At that time, airlines were allowed to fly direct to the US from Dublin without having to match these with any to/from Shannon. It was expected that this would result in a huge increase in services between Dublin and the US and Aer Lingus has identified 16 destinations that it would like to serve directly from Dublin.\n\n===Recent history===\nWith the success of Ireland's '[[Celtic Tiger]]' economy, Dublin Airport saw growth in the 1990s and 2000s. This demand was driven by an increased demand for business travel to and from the country, together with an increase in inward tourism and a surge in demand for foreign holidays and city breaks from the [[Irish people|Irish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carhire.ie/airportpassengernumbers.php |title=Passenger Numbers at Irish Airports - 2002 to 2015 |publisher=Executive Trust Ltd |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe demand from Ireland's migrant workers, principally those from Eastern Europe, has resulted in a large number of new routes opening to destinations in the European Union accession states. Ireland was one of only three European Union countries (as well as the United Kingdom and Sweden) to open its borders freely to workers from the ten accession states that [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union in 2004]].\n\nThe airport saw significant declines in traffic in 2009 and 2010, although since 2011 the airport has seen an increase in traffic. During 2012, this increase continued with passenger numbers growing by 1.9%. During 2013, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were above the 20 million mark for the first time since 2009 with a 5.6% increase year on year. During 2014, this positive trend continued with an 8% increase over 2013.  As of early December 2015, passenger figures have increased by 16% compared to 2014, and the previous record of 23.46 million passengers set in 2008 has already been passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413095801/https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2016  |title=Dublin Airport Breaks Annual Passenger Numbers Record |publisher=Dublin Airport |date= 4 December 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, Dublin Airport was chosen for the Special Achievement in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) award for its use of mapping software from ESRI Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.traveldailynews.com/post/dublin-airport-wins-international-award-for-mapping-software|title=Dublin Airport wins international award for mapping software}}</ref>\n\n==Long-haul traffic==\nAs of August 2019, there are services to 31 intercontinental destinations from Dublin Airport (not including [[Anatolia]]).<ref name=\"Dublin Airport Information\">{{cite web|url=https://www.carhire.ie/car-hire-dublin-airport.php |title=Dublin Airport Information |publisher=CARHIRE.ie |date= |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> In 2007, Etihad Airways began operating between Dublin Airport and Abu Dhabi, and increased its capacity to 14 weekly flights in March 2010.

On 22 March 2007, the [[Open skies]] agreement between the US and EU was ratified.

All assets and liabilities previously owned by Aer Rianta were transferred to Dublin Airport Authority. The State Airports Act 2004 also established new airport authorities at Shannon and Cork Airports. The Shannon Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority had separate boards of directors and were authorised under the Act to prepare business plans, which may have in time lead to their full separation from the Dublin Airport Authority. Following a decision by the Irish Government, Shannon Airport became a separate publicly owned airport on 31 December 2012.\n\nIn July 2013, the Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed \"''DAA plc''\" by the Irish Government. The rename was principally to remove the \"Dublin\" and \"Authority\" elements of the name which were seen to have little relevance to the overall functions of DAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinairportguide.com/daa-rename/|title=Dublin Airport Guide.com \u2013 Dublin Airport Authority Renamed|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> The name change announced in July 2013 took effect on 6 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.ie/gns/media-centre/press-releases/14-11-06/Name_Change_Takes_Effect_At_daa.aspx|title=Press Releases > Name Change Takes Effect At daa|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212319/http://www.daa.ie/gns/media-centre/press-releases/14-11-06/Name_Change_Takes_Effect_At_daa.aspx|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs the largest gateway to Ireland, over 25 million passengers travelled through the airport in 2015, a 15% increase over the previous year.<ref name=\"issuu.com\">{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/daapublishing/docs/daa_annual_report_2015/1|title=daa Annual Report 2015|website=issuu|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref> The main contributors to the growth in traffic in 2015 were the 23 new routes launched during the year and extra capacity on 40 existing services.

The project was designed by [[Pascall+Watson]] architects and the total cost was \u20ac600 million. [[Aer Lingus]] is the main carrier operating at Terminal 2 and since its opening have developed a hub at Dublin primarily for traffic traveling between Europe and the United States.  Terminal 2 is now the transatlantic gateway for flights to the United States as it features a [[United States border preclearance|US pre-clearance immigration facility]] which was previously housed in Terminal 1.\n\nConstruction of Terminal 2 began on 1 October 2007, and it was officially opened on 19 November 2010 by the then [[Taoiseach]] Brian Cowen T.D.  The intended purpose of Terminal 2 was to house all long-haul carriers in addition to Aer Lingus; however significant growth in US traffic has resulted in most long haul carriers flying outside the United States remaining in Terminal 1.  During the design of Terminal 2 provisions were made for an expanded check in hall and additional pier (Pier F) to cater for future growth.  Currently [[Aer Lingus]], [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Norwegian Air International|Norwegian]] and [[United Airlines]] operate from Terminal 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/airlines-terminal-2 |title=Airlines Flying From Dublin Airport T2 |publisher=Dublin Airport T2 |accessdate=1 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606024510/https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/airlines-terminal-2 |archivedate=6 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety and security==\nDAA has its own branch of the [[Airport Police (Ireland)|Airport Police Service]] which is mandated to provide aviation and general policing at the airport.

The airfield quickly fell into disrepair and grass grew on the former runways.{{citation needed|reason=that there were actual runways rather than a field|date=March 2019}}\n\n===The beginnings in the 1930s and 1940s===\n[[File:Dublin Airport 1940 terminal building.jpg|thumb|The original [[International style (architecture)|international style]] passenger terminal, completed in 1940]]\nIn 1936, the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] established a new civil airline, [[Aer Lingus]], which began operating from the [[Military airbase|military aerodrome]], [[Casement Aerodrome]], at [[Baldonnel, Ireland|Baldonnel]] to the southwest of [[Dublin]]. A decision was made that a civil airport should replace Baldonnel as Dublin's airport.  The former Collinstown site, extended into the neighbouring townlands of Rock and Corballis, was chosen.\n\nWork on the new airport began in 1937. By the end of 1939, a grass airfield surface, internal roads, car parks and electrical power and lighting were set up. The inaugural flight from Dublin took place on 19 January 1940 to [[Liverpool]]. In August 1938, work began on a new [[airport terminal]] building. The terminal building was designed by architect Desmond FitzGerald, brother of politician [[Garret FitzGerald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2010/1937-dublin-airport/|title=1937 \u2013 Dublin Airport \u2013 Architecture of Fingal \u2013 Archiseek.com|work=Archiseek.com|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=22 January 2010}}</ref> FitzGerald, who had designed an airport terminal as part of his college studies, led a team of architects that also included Kevin Barry, Daith\u00ed Hanley, Charles Aliaga Kelly, Dermot O'Toole and Harry Robson. The terminal building opened in early 1941, with its design heavily influenced by the tiered structure of the luxury ocean liners of the time. The terminal was awarded the Triennial Gold Medal of the Royal Hibernian Institute of Architects in 1942 and is today a listed building.\n[[File:Dublin Airport (5997469039).jpg|thumbnail|An [[Aer Lingus]] [[DC-3]] plane at Dublin Airport's original Terminal 1 in May 1950.]]\n\nDue to [[World War II]], which was known as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]] in Ireland, services were severely restricted at Dublin Airport until late 1945. The only international scheduled routes operated during this time were by Aer Lingus to Liverpool (and for a period to [[Manchester]]'s [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]]). The end of the war meant the beginning of a major expansion in services at the airport. Aer Lingus resumed its London service to Croydon in November 1945. In 1947, [[KLM]] started the first European flights to Dublin with a service to [[Amsterdam]]. Three new concrete runways were completed in 1948, and in 1950 - after ten years in operation - the airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/about-us/did-you-know/history|title=History|website=www.dublinairport.com|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Expanding in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThroughout the 1950s Dublin Airport expanded with virtually uninterrupted traffic growth. Runway extensions and terminal enhancements were carried out to deal with the influx of traffic and passengers. New airlines began serving the airport also. These included [[British European Airways]], [[Sabena]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|BKS]].\n\nIn 1958, a new transatlantic service was started by Aer Lingus via Shannon Airport. By the mid 1950s, it was clear that the original terminal building was too small to cope with growing passenger numbers. A new North Terminal was opened in June 1959. Originally, the plan was that North Terminal would handle all US and European flights, but instead it became the arrivals terminal for all Dublin Airport passengers, while the original passenger terminal was used for departures.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the number of scheduled carriers continued to grow. By the close of the 1960s, a sizeable number of [[Boeing 737]]s, [[BAC One-Eleven]]s, [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]]s were using the airport regularly. To cope with larger aircraft in the late 1960s new departure gate piers were added close to the old terminal to cope with larger aircraft.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> These piers would subsequently be connected to Terminal 1. During 1969, the airport handled 1,737,151 passengers.\n\nThe advent of [[wide-body aircraft]] posed opportunities and challenges for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above [[O'Connell Street]] in Dublin on [[Saint Patrick's Day]]; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To cope with this, a new \u00a310 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> The growth which was anticipated at Dublin's airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.\n\n[[File:Ryanair (EI-CCW), Dublin, July 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Two of the airport's largest operators side-by-side, a [[Ryanair]] [[BAC 1-11]] (front) and an Aer Lingus [[Boeing 737]] (rear) in 1993]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BDY), Dublin, July 1992 (01).jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-200 and a [[Ryanair]] BAC-111 in July 1992]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-ASI), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 747 in May 1994]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BXB), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-400 and a British Airways ATR 42]]\n\n===Continuing in the 1980s and 1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1983 Aer Lingus opened its 'Aer Lingus Commuter' division<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerlingus.com/media/pdfs/AL_Precourse_Workbook_January%202017_LR_FA.pdf|title=Online pre-course Workbook, Version 2, January 2017|website=Aer Lingus|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> which took delivery of [[Short Brothers|Shorts]], [[Saab AB]] and [[Fokker]] [[turboprop]] aircraft to open regular daily domestic services to and from Ireland's smaller regional airports for the first time, as well as to serve existing routes to smaller regional airports in the United Kingdom. At various stages of its operations, flights were operated to several Irish regional airports to feed passengers into Aer Lingus's international network. These domestic destinations included [[Cork Airport]], [[Shannon Airport]], [[Kerry Airport]], [[Galway Airport]], [[Ireland West Airport Knock]], [[Waterford Airport]], [[Sligo Airport]] and [[City of Derry Airport]]. Aer Lingus Commuter has since been re-absorbed into the main company. The domestic routes, with the exception of Dublin-Shannon, were taken over by Aer Arann. Most of these routes have since been discontinued as the development of the motorway network in Ireland has resulted in significant reductions in travelling time by road. Aer Lingus has continued with the remaining Dublin\u2013UK flights.\n\nDuring the 1980s, major competition, especially on the Dublin\u2013London routes, resulted in passenger numbers swelling to 5.1 million in 1989. In the same year a new {{convert|8650|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} runway and a state-of-the-art air traffic control centre were opened. Dublin Airport continued to expand rapidly in the 1990s. Pier A, which had been the first extension to the old terminal building, was significantly extended. A new Pier C, complete with [[Jet bridge|air bridges]], was built and as soon as this was completed, work commenced to extend it to double its capacity. The ground floor of the original terminal building was returned to passenger service after many years to provide additional departure gates. Pier D, completed in October 2007, is a dedicated low-fares boarding area and provides 14 quick turn-around stands and departure gates; these are not served by air bridges.\n\n===The Bilateral Air Transport Agreement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn 1993, a major milestone for the airport was the signing of a new United States \u2013 Ireland [[Bilateral Air Transport Agreement|bilateral agreement]] which allowed airlines to operate some direct transatlantic services for the first time to/from Dublin Airport instead of touching down en route at Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. (Shannon had once been a major transatlantic refuelling stop for pre-jet aircraft, and this agreement was designed to protect the interests of the Shannon region when modern jets no longer required a refuelling stop and Shannon saw a fall-off in traffic.) Airlines still had to provide an equal number of flights either to or through Shannon as to Dublin. A gradual further watering down of Shannon's so-called 'stopover' status came into effect in November 2006 when more direct flights to Dublin were allowed. The stopover requirement disappeared completely in 2008. At that time, airlines were allowed to fly direct to the US from Dublin without having to match these with any to/from Shannon. It was expected that this would result in a huge increase in services between Dublin and the US and Aer Lingus has identified 16 destinations that it would like to serve directly from Dublin.\n\n===Recent history===\nWith the success of Ireland's '[[Celtic Tiger]]' economy, Dublin Airport saw growth in the 1990s and 2000s. This demand was driven by an increased demand for business travel to and from the country, together with an increase in inward tourism and a surge in demand for foreign holidays and city breaks from the [[Irish people|Irish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carhire.ie/airportpassengernumbers.php |title=Passenger Numbers at Irish Airports - 2002 to 2015 |publisher=Executive Trust Ltd |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe demand from Ireland's migrant workers, principally those from Eastern Europe, has resulted in a large number of new routes opening to destinations in the European Union accession states. Ireland was one of only three European Union countries (as well as the United Kingdom and Sweden) to open its borders freely to workers from the ten accession states that [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union in 2004]].\n\nThe airport saw significant declines in traffic in 2009 and 2010, although since 2011 the airport has seen an increase in traffic. During 2012, this increase continued with passenger numbers growing by 1.9%. During 2013, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were above the 20 million mark for the first time since 2009 with a 5.6% increase year on year. During 2014, this positive trend continued with an 8% increase over 2013.  As of early December 2015, passenger figures have increased by 16% compared to 2014, and the previous record of 23.46 million passengers set in 2008 has already been passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413095801/https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2016  |title=Dublin Airport Breaks Annual Passenger Numbers Record |publisher=Dublin Airport |date= 4 December 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, Dublin Airport was chosen for the Special Achievement in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) award for its use of mapping software from ESRI Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.traveldailynews.com/post/dublin-airport-wins-international-award-for-mapping-software|title=Dublin Airport wins international award for mapping software}}</ref>\n\n==Long-haul traffic==\nAs of August 2019, there are services to 31 intercontinental destinations from Dublin Airport (not including [[Anatolia]]).<ref name=\"Dublin Airport Information\">{{cite web|url=https://www.carhire.ie/car-hire-dublin-airport.php |title=Dublin Airport Information |publisher=CARHIRE.ie |date= |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> In 2007, Etihad Airways began operating between Dublin Airport and Abu Dhabi, and increased its capacity to 14 weekly flights in March 2010.

In return, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] placed a limit of four airports in the US that Aer Lingus could operate to. On 22 March 2007, the [[Open skies]] agreement between the US and EU was ratified. This resulted in the immediate cancellation of the long-running 'Shannon Stopover' requirement, whereby the Irish government had insisted that 50% of all transatlantic flights between Ireland and the United States must pass through Shannon Airport.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/new-open-skies-deal-to-see-end-of-shannon-stopovers-1.361532 New 'open skies' deal to see end of Shannon stopovers], ''The Irish Times'', 6 June 2003</ref>\n\n===US border preclearance===\nDublin Airport is one of only two airports in Europe with [[United States border preclearance]] services for US-bound passengers (the other being Shannon Airport).

All assets and liabilities previously owned by Aer Rianta were transferred to Dublin Airport Authority. The State Airports Act 2004 also established new airport authorities at Shannon and Cork Airports. The Shannon Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority had separate boards of directors and were authorised under the Act to prepare business plans, which may have in time lead to their full separation from the Dublin Airport Authority. Following a decision by the Irish Government, Shannon Airport became a separate publicly owned airport on 31 December 2012.\n\nIn July 2013, the Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed \"''DAA plc''\" by the Irish Government. The rename was principally to remove the \"Dublin\" and \"Authority\" elements of the name which were seen to have little relevance to the overall functions of DAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinairportguide.com/daa-rename/|title=Dublin Airport Guide.com \u2013 Dublin Airport Authority Renamed|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> The name change announced in July 2013 took effect on 6 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.ie/gns/media-centre/press-releases/14-11-06/Name_Change_Takes_Effect_At_daa.aspx|title=Press Releases > Name Change Takes Effect At daa|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212319/http://www.daa.ie/gns/media-centre/press-releases/14-11-06/Name_Change_Takes_Effect_At_daa.aspx|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs the largest gateway to Ireland, over 25 million passengers travelled through the airport in 2015, a 15% increase over the previous year.<ref name=\"issuu.com\">{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/daapublishing/docs/daa_annual_report_2015/1|title=daa Annual Report 2015|website=issuu|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref> The main contributors to the growth in traffic in 2015 were the 23 new routes launched during the year and extra capacity on 40 existing services.

The project was designed by [[Pascall+Watson]] architects and the total cost was \u20ac600 million. [[Aer Lingus]] is the main carrier operating at Terminal 2 and since its opening have developed a hub at Dublin primarily for traffic traveling between Europe and the United States.  Terminal 2 is now the transatlantic gateway for flights to the United States as it features a [[United States border preclearance|US pre-clearance immigration facility]] which was previously housed in Terminal 1.\n\nConstruction of Terminal 2 began on 1 October 2007, and it was officially opened on 19 November 2010 by the then [[Taoiseach]] Brian Cowen T.D.  The intended purpose of Terminal 2 was to house all long-haul carriers in addition to Aer Lingus; however significant growth in US traffic has resulted in most long haul carriers flying outside the United States remaining in Terminal 1.  During the design of Terminal 2 provisions were made for an expanded check in hall and additional pier (Pier F) to cater for future growth.  Currently [[Aer Lingus]], [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Norwegian Air International|Norwegian]] and [[United Airlines]] operate from Terminal 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/airlines-terminal-2 |title=Airlines Flying From Dublin Airport T2 |publisher=Dublin Airport T2 |accessdate=1 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606024510/https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/airlines-terminal-2 |archivedate=6 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety and security==\nDAA has its own branch of the [[Airport Police (Ireland)|Airport Police Service]] which is mandated to provide aviation and general policing at the airport.
