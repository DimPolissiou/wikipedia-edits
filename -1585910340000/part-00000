In the past, when Great Danes were commonly used to [[Boar hunting#Hunting dogs|hunt boars]], [[Cropping (animal)|cropping]] of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily [[Companion dog|companion animals]], cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA873&dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22 \"Easter Bonnets for Dogs Make Ears Stand Erect\" ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1934]</ref> Today, the practice is common in the United States, but much less common in Europe.

They are known for seeking physical affection with their owners, and the breed is often referred to as a \"gentle giant\".<ref name=AKC /><ref name=\"animal.discovery.com\">{{cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane.htm|title=Great Dane|work=Animal Planet|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619221310/http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane.htm|archivedate=19 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGreat Danes are generally well disposed toward other dogs, other noncanine pets, and familiar humans.

However, it is important not to over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems.

Even at one year of age, a Great Dane continues to grow for several more months.<ref name=\"All about Great Danes.com\" />\n\n== Health ==\nGreat Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fairly slow metabolism. This results in less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat ([[gastric dilatation volvulus]]). To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane/|title=Great Dane - Dogs 101 - Animal Planet|website=www.animalplanet.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315025350/https://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane|archivedate=15 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \nTheir average lifespan is 6 to 8 years; however, some Great Danes have been known to reach 10 years of age or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|title=Summary results of the Purebred Dog Health Survey for Great Danes|year=2004|publisher=Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816075617/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|title=National Health Survey|year=2004|publisher=Great Dane Club of America|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043224/http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].\n\n[[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]  and many [[congenital]] heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its [[nickname]]: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan.

However, it is important not to over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems. Because of a puppy's natural energy, Dane owners often take steps to minimize activity while the dog is still growing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danes.org.uk/care.htm|title=Great Dane Adoption Society \u2013 UK rescue and rehoming|work=danes.org.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914172210/http://www.danes.org.uk/care.htm|archivedate=14 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"All about Great Danes.com\">{{cite web | title=All about Great Danes.com | publisher=All about Great Danes.com Exercise Advice | year=2012 | url=http://www.all-about-great-danes.com/great-dane-activity.html | accessdate=5 April 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409022906/http://www.all-about-great-danes.com/great-dane-activity.html | archivedate=9 April 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGiven their large size, Great Danes continue to grow (mostly gaining weight) longer than most dogs. Even at one year of age, a Great Dane continues to grow for several more months.<ref name=\"All about Great Danes.com\" />\n\n== Health ==\nGreat Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fairly slow metabolism. This results in less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat ([[gastric dilatation volvulus]]). To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane/|title=Great Dane - Dogs 101 - Animal Planet|website=www.animalplanet.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315025350/https://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane|archivedate=15 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \nTheir average lifespan is 6 to 8 years; however, some Great Danes have been known to reach 10 years of age or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|title=Summary results of the Purebred Dog Health Survey for Great Danes|year=2004|publisher=Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816075617/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|title=National Health Survey|year=2004|publisher=Great Dane Club of America|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043224/http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].\n\n[[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]  and many [[congenital]] heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its [[nickname]]: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan. Great Danes also may carry the merle gene, which is part of the genetic makeup that creates the harlequin coloring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecareforanimals.com/animal-eye-conditions/canine/296-merle-gene.html|publisher=Eye Care for Animals|title=The Merle Gene and Multiple Ocular Abnormalities|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212182621/http://www.eyecareforanimals.com/animal-eye-conditions/canine/296-merle-gene.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The merle gene is an incomplete dominant, meaning only one copy of the gene is needed to show the merle coloring; two merle genes produce excessive white markings and many health issues such as deafness, blindness, or other debilitating ocular issues. Great Danes can also develop [[wobbler disease]], a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs do grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs. This can be treated with surgery or may heal itself over time.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.vin.com/doc/?id=6693870|title=World Small Animal Veterinary Association World Congress Proceedings, 2004|date=30 March 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural significance ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n<!-- This section is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all Danes appearing in books, films, etc. Please add only items where the Dane is the primary focus of attention.

It can be combined naturally or artificially to form stronger types, which Mankind harnessed for technology such as airships or androids. Only skilled and disciplined people can use its raw form without losing control, so the most common use of Dust is in ammunition - though some still use archaic means, like weaving it into clothing or their own body.

In the present day, only four remain; ''Atlas'' in the north continent and ''Mistral'' in the east, while ''Vacuo'' and ''Vale'' share the largest continent. Protected by natural barriers and human tenacity, each kingdom has a governing council and their own individual militaries - some mandatory, some not. Outside the kingdom walls are roaming nomad tribes and small villages, but most fall to Grimm attacks. Each kingdom has a Huntsmen academy to train the next generations of Huntsmen to protect humanity from the Grimm.

Once believed to be evil spirits, further study revealed they continued to evolve and diversify over time like animals. They attack humans and their creations first and foremost, only conflicting with wildlife for territory. Common belief is that Grimm don't need to feed; they choose to. They are drawn to negative emotions - with numbers proportionate to how far panic spreads. Captured Grimm usually break free or die quickly and their bodies evaporate shortly after their death, making study difficult. The narrator concludes that Grimm are not mindless; while younger ones are more reckless, older ones learn from their experiences to be more cautious in the future - a natural adaptation that makes them more effective killers.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR4\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n   | Title           = Aura\n   | Aux3            = 2:00\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|12|9}} (DVD/Blu-ray)\n   | ShortSummary    = The narrator explains Huntsmen are considered Remnant's greatest warriors in large part by mastering Aura; a manifestation of the life force or soul that runs through every living being - save Grimm - but which only true warriors can amplify and control. It is primarily used for defense, sheathing the wielder in a protective force field to help survive otherwise fatal blows -\nthough their reserves deplete with each hit until exhausted, leaving them vulnerable. Aura's second main use is by projecting it into a more tangible form known as a ''Semblance'', providing a special power unique to each wielder such as superhuman strength or telekinesis. The narrator claims that, with enough training and focus, Aura can turn a warrior into far more than a simple man or woman.\n\n[Note: This episode was a DVD/Blu-Ray exclusive.]\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n}}\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Episode table|background=#DAA560 | overall=5 | season=5 | title=17 | aux3=5 | aux3T=Length | airdate=10 | episodes=\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR5\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n   | Title           = Vytal Festival Tournament\n   | Aux3            = 2:40\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|8}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Professor Ozpin explains how the multi-year Great War was ended when humanity's leaders made peace on the island of Vytal, forming new laws, traditions and the Huntsman Academies to create modern society. Among these is the Vytal Festival to celebrate the peacetime every two years, rotating between each kingdom to ensure their cultures remain open to the world. The Vytal Festival's Tournament, a keystone of the event, was designed to test the strength of the kingdom's Huntsman in a safe and friendly environment, the competition ensuring every warrior strives to be their best. As the tournament's rosters grew, the four kingdoms created the Amity Colosseum; a mobile arena that can visit any kingdom in Remnant.

Each kingdom established an academy after the Great War: ''Beacon Academy'' in Vale, ''Haven Academy'' in Mistral, ''Shade Academy'' in Vacuo, and ''Atlas Academy'' in Atlas (originally Mantle). They recruit the most promising graduates from primary combat schools, grouping them in teams of four to develop communication, empathy and teamwork skills. Students are separated from kingdom allegiance while in the Academy and, upon graduating, choose their work and employers, usually via mission boards; kingdom affiliation is by choice. However, Atlas Academy is an exception, scrutinized for indoctrinating a military lifestyle upon its students, pressuring enlistment in the Military's Special Units after graduation. Ozpin states that regardless of the teaching method, the end result is the same: Huntsmen and Huntresses, ready to make their own paths. Some stay in a team, others work alone - all are expected to protect and serve humanity, never succumbing to the darkness.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR7\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n   | Title           = Cross Continental Transmit System\n   | Aux3            = 3:07\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|26}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Ozpin details the history of the Cross Continental Transmit System (CCTS), before which kingdoms could only communicate within their borders by radio or across borders with physical messages, the latter of which were always endangered by Grimm. Establishing relay satellites was impractical because spaceflight was impossible, as known Dust types lose their powers outside Remnant's atmosphere, so Atlas instead developed a series of four tower-housed wireless-signal hubs - one in each kingdom. While allowing an online web and communication accessible via handheld \"scrolls\", connectivity suffers the further one is from a kingdom, with attempts at smaller support towers suffering from Grimm attacks. Despite the benefits of global communication, Ozpin notes the system's fatal flaw is that losing even one of the towers will take down the entire network, describing it a poetic irony that Remnant's people must either speak as one or not speak at all.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR8\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n   | Title           = The Four Maidens\n   | Aux3            = 7:02\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|1|23}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Ozpin tells the tale of the Four Maidens; An old wizard living in the woods sees a maiden, Winter, waiting outside in the snow for her sisters, falling asleep from the serenity she brings. When he wakes, he sees another maiden, Spring, also waiting for her sisters and planting seeds to create a beautiful garden. The wizard watches until he hears laughter from a third waiting maiden, Summer, who convinces the wizard to step outside and embrace the world. They prepare a feast together just as the fourth sister, Fall, arrives and asks the wizard's name when he invites her. The Wizard claims he is uninteresting and has nothing to his name despite centuries of life, but Fall remarks otherwise and convinces him he has everything he needs in life. The wizard asks why they helped him with his loneliness, with Fall's answer being they would do so for anyone. Repaying their kindness, the wizard bestows his magic upon the sisters, gifting them control over the elements of nature. The sisters promise to use their gifts to aid others and to  visit their friend every year.\n\n[Note: A shortened version of the tale of the Four Maidens was also told by Pyrrha Nikos (Vol. 3, Ch. 6)]\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n}}\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Episode table|background=#DAA560 | overall=5 | season=5 | title=17 | aux3=5 | aux3T=Length | airdate=10 | episodes=\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR9\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n   | Title           = Vale\n   | Aux3            = 2:23\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|17}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow introduces Remnant; a world where towns constantly rise and fall against Grimm. Currently, the Faunus race holds the island continent of Menagerie, while the four kingdoms - Vale, Mistral, Atlas, Vacuo - are the \"sweet spots\" to live in. Vale, located on the northeastern end of the largest continent Sanus, is a kingdom protected by two natural barriers - mountains in the east and shallow waters on the northwest-coast, making it very defensible. The kingdom consists of Vale - its namesake main city - along with a few smaller cities along the northwest coastline. There is also the small island of Patch, off the coast across from the capital, which Qrow claims a nice place to raise a family - as Ruby and Yang were. Attempts to extend the kingdom past the mountains, such as the Mountain Glenn project, have been colossal failures. Qrow states Vale is \"not half bad\", as regular climate, natural barriers and serious border defense enable citizens to live their lives instead of fighting for survival, though the Fall of Beacon has now left people concerned.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR10\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n   | Title           = Mistral\n   | Aux3            = 2:20\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|18}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow narrates the landmass to the east of Sanus as the second largest continent of Remnant, Anima, where  the kingdom of Mistral is located. Mistral has the largest territory of any kingdom, home to a wide variety of ecosystems and lifestyles. Its high society is known for fashion, architecture and theater, while the lower class \"has a fame of its own\"; the biggest black market in Remnant where one can hire thieves, assassins and thugs of all kinds. However, all of Mistral's inhabitants have something in common: their respect for nature, especially the sea and sky. Qrow states that natural resources had an impact on Mistral's culture and technology, starting with the first settlers who found shelter in its wind-carved cliffs, from where they expanded into the land. A huge problem for its government is the kingdom's sheer size, which enables a lot of outlaws hide there\u2014while the capital is mostly secure, other cities like Windpath and Kuchinashi are harder to govern. Qrow concludes that there are a lot of places to hide, though one has to know where to look to find certain people.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR11\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n   | Title           = Atlas\n   | Aux3            = 3:12\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow voices a low opinion of most Atlas citizens. Both the youngest and arguably most successful kingdom, it was originally called Mantle and founded by settlers who, for unknown reasons, traveled to the northernmost continent, Solitas. The cold climate and large mountains protected settlers from Grimm - but only if they could adapt themselves, developing advanced technology faster than the rest of Remnant. The \"Great War\" gave Mantle another boost, as new forms of Dust application, weaponry, research and mining allowed it to expand. The territory around its combat school, Alsius, was used to build new facilities. After the \"Great War\", Alsius was renamed as Atlas and took in many war veterans, using New Dust technologies to enhance its grounds and secure surrounding areas. Eventually, the military, labs, research facilities and residential areas moved to Atlas as well. When the new city outgrew Mantle, the capital was moved there and the kingdom itself renamed as Atlas. Qrow remarks that while some people called it \"a golden age of prosperity\", the people left in Mantle felt it \"the coldest winter they ever knew.\"\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR12\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n   | Title           = Vacuo\n   | Aux3            = 2:58\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|20}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow remarks Vacuo may be worse off than Mantle was. Located at the western end of Sanus, it was once \"a paradise\"- an oasis in the surrounding desert bursting with natural resources, geographical defenses and the world's largest Dust deposits. Many nomads settled a thriving lifestyle, but their society became complacent while the rest of the world had to adapt to survive. Soon, the other kingdoms set their eyes on Vacuo's resources, sparking what would be the \"Great War\". After years of conflict, unrestricted mining and ecological disasters, Vauco was reduced to a barren wasteland: citizens live in makeshift homes, traveling frequently in response to fleeting resources or occasional Grimm attacks. While still a kingdom, its formal government goes unheeded by citizens with Shade Academy considered the only source of order. However, its citizens still have a mutual respect for one another, following an unspoken rule: \"If you can survive here, then you're welcome here.\" Qrow recalls how Ozpin said the four kingdoms represented what mankind is capable of when working together, lamenting that they would need Ozpin now to do so.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR13\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n  | Title           = Between Kingdoms\n  | Aux3            = 3:18\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|12|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = Qrow narrates how areas between kingdoms are mostly populated by Grimm. Trained Huntsmen and Huntresses should be fine on the roads unless they meet large packs. Small villages and towns also dot the land, inhabited by people who either don't want to deal with life in the kingdoms, are upset with how the kingdoms are governed or simply prefer independence. If a town is founded by \"smart\" people, it can survive the same way the kingdoms do: with natural barriers and strong defenses - or else frequent Grimm attacks will likely destroy them within a year. Another problem is wandering bandits tribes; groups of usually-skilled fighters who prey on convoys, tending to attack and pillage weaker towns. Attacks by Grimm or bandits are usually concurrent; If a town survived a bandit attack, the lingering negative emotions may attract Grimm - and in reverse, raiders will attack towns the Grimm have weakened. Bandits never stay in one place long, as the Grimm threaten them as well. According to Qrow, almost all of Remnant has been mapped, but there are some areas from where nobody has returned alive - places where \"she\" (Salem) could possibly be.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR14\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n  | Title           = Faunus\n  | Aux3            = 4:40\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|26|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = A humanoid species, notable for each having a single animalistic trait\u2014such as cat ears. Existing at least as long as mankind, Faunus are genetically compatible with humans, though any such union will always produce Faunus children. Qrow narrates the history of Faunus and humans as full of conflicts; in ancient times, humans were afraid of Faunus and either avoided them, pushed them out of settlements or brutally hunted them. Humans began to outnumber and exploit them\u2014such as making them cheap labor force\u2014and the Faunus saw them as a threat. But when Grimm attacked a village in Sanus, it became a turning point as the two races united to defend their home against a shared enemy. Another milestone was after the \"Great War; Remnant was desperate for compromises and one of them involved the Faunus, who were awarded equal rights as citizens and received the island continent of Menagerie to govern for themselves. However, Qrow states this was still a bad deal for the Faunus; while they live all over Remnant, the quality of their treatment varies in different regions, with a lot of Faunus withdrawing from the kingdoms to live packed together on Menagerie. Conflicts still continue as a result, with the Faunus now organized in groups - such as the White Fang.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR15\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n  | Title           = Schnee Dust Company\n  | Aux3            = 4:28\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|17|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = Qrow speaks negatively on the present-day Schnee Dust Company, which now holds the monopoly on the extremely valuable and important Dust products in Remnant. Its founder Nikolas Schnee, son of a Dust miner, was born in Mantle after the end of the \"Great War\", during the kingdom's transformative period in which it depended on others for Dust resources. Nikolas worked in the mines, went to combat school and studied. After his father's death, Nikolas used his small inheritance to fund an expedition for new Dust deposits and founded the SDC off its success. Known for quality, affordability, and trust, Nikolas personally oversaw every expedition and expansion, gaining the trust of his men and opening businesses in every kingdom. However, following years of working in Dust mines, Nikolas was forced into early retirement mostly because of health issues. A man named Jacques Gel\u00e9 then married Nikolas' daughter, took on the Schnee name and convinced Nikolas that he was the \"right\" successor. Jacques is a \"cunning businessman\" whose leadership made the SDC more profitable than ever, dominating the industry - though with many questionable methods: cheap labor forces, dangerous working conditions, destroying competition and company propaganda. In Qrow's opinion, Jacques only cares about winning - and with him in charge, the future of the once-good Schnee name is uncertain.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR16\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n  | Title           = The Great War\n  | Aux3            = 7:20\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|14|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = The \"Great War\" lasted around ten years, preceded by a century of tension. Mistral had conquered Anima and made an alliance with Mantle, exchanging of supplies and technology. An \"incident\" in Mantle led to a decree that abolished the arts and repressed self-expression, attempting to control the citizens' emotions to reduce Grimm attacks, to which Mistral partly complied when Mantle tried to enforce the decree in other kingdoms. This and other issues, such as Mistral and Mantle's treatment of citizens or maintenance of slavery, caused conflicts with Vale's citizens, resulting in a clash when Mistral tried to expand to the east coast of Sanus. The king of Vale avoided conflict, but the opposing settlers did not, their riot sparking the first battle of the \"Great War\". Mantle supported Mistral, with battles starting in both Anima and Sanus. Grimm attacked all combatants, sometimes forcing cease-fires between the humans to deal with the monsters. Vacuo initially stayed neutral until Mantle and Mistral tried to force their cooperation, instead supporting Vale in fear of the other side's victory. The war ended with the \"Vacuo campaign\", Mistral and Mantle attempting to claim Vacuo's Dust mines and cut off supplies for their enemies. The king of Vale led his and Vacuo's forces and, armed with crown, sword and scepter, he decimated the enemy army. The \"deadliest battle of the war\" cost many lives and created the legend of the \"Warrior King\". In the end, everyone bowed to the king of Vale, who refused to rule over Remnant and established the treaty of Vytal instead; territories were redistributed, slavery abolished, and governments restructured. The last king of Vale founded the Huntsmen academies and gave his most trusted followers command over them, promising to teach mankind how to fight on the condition it was not against each other; a bargain Qrow says mankind has not honored.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n}}\n\n==Home media==\n{{expand section|date=July 2017}}\n\n[[Cinedigm]] has released box sets for each season of ''RWBY''. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 70%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Volume\n! scope=\"column\"| Release date\n! width=\"5%\" | Ref.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" width=\"1%\" style=\"background: black;\" |\n| 1\n| November 12, 2013\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-Barbara-Dunkelman/dp/B00DP4YC7U/|title=RWBY|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref> \n|-\n| 2\n| December 9, 2014\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-2-Lindsey-Tuggey/dp/B00NLZA8E4/|title=RWBY: Volume 2|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref> \n|-\n| 3\n| May 3, 2016\n| <ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-3-None/dp/B01BLX0UBS/|title=RWBY: Volume 3|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| 4\n| June 6, 2017\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/45092/rwbyvolume4.html|title=Blu-ray Releases Details RWBY: Volume 4|publisher=High-Def Digest|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-4-None/dp/B06XKS41H2/|title=RWBY: Volume 4|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| 5\n| June 5, 2018\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-5-None/dp/B07BC6KQWJ/|title=RWBY: Volume 5|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| 6\n| July 2, 2019\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-6-Barbara-Dunkelman/dp/B07QDSKFL7/|title=RWBY: Volume 6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn Japan, Volume 1 was released on DVD and Blu-ray by [[Warner Bros.]] Japan on December 9, 2015, with a Japanese dub.<ref>{{ cite web | url=https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1441877147 | title=\u5317\u7c73\u767a\u306e\u7f8e\u5c11\u59733DCG\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300eRWBY\u300f\u524d\u91ce\u667a\u662d\u3055\u3093\u3089\u8ffd\u52a0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c83\u540d\u304c\u89e3\u7981\uff01\u3000\u5287\u5834\u3067\u306e\u5148\u884c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u4e0a\u6620\u3082\u6c7a\u5b9a | language=Japanese | publisher=[[Animate]] | date=2015-09-10 | accessdate=2017-12-10 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em| refs = <!-- Please keep the following list-defined references in alphabetical order by refname -->\n\n<ref name=\"anime\">{{Cite web| title = FEATURE: Inside Rooster Teeth's \"RWBY\"\n | last = Rush | first = Amanda\n | publisher = Crunchyroll\n | url = http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/07/12/feature-inside-rooster-teeths-rwby\n | date = July 12, 2013 | access-date = July 18, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crunchyroll.com 2013-08-16\">{{Cite web| title = Crunchroll to simulcast \"RWBY\"\n | url = http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-press-release/2013/08/16/crunchyroll-to-simulcast-rwby\n | date = August 16, 2013 | access-date = August 22, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"discretion\">{{Cite web| title = On RWBY and Viewer Discretion...\n | author = Haddock, Gray\n | publisher = [[Rooster Teeth]]\n | url = http://roosterteeth.com/post/51193367\n | date = January 1, 2016 | access-date = March 5, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RT 2013-07-18\">{{Cite web| title = RWBY Pre-Show Live Stream\n | publisher = [[Rooster Teeth]] | via = [[YouTube]]\n | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dleqek092RM\n | date = July 18, 2013 | access-date = September 8, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Vol 2 announce\">{{Cite web| title = RWBY Vol 2 will premiere at RTX July 4\u20136 this year!\n | last = Oum | first = Monty\n | author-link = Monty Oum\n | publisher = [[Twitter]]\n | url = https://twitter.com/montyoum/status/428969903883030528\n | date = January 30, 2014 | access-date = January 30, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"YouTube 2013-07-15\">{{Cite web| title = Rooster Teeth Podcast #227\n | publisher = [[YouTube]]\n | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlUnZdLBOU\n | date = July 15, 2013 | access-date = July 29, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"YouTube 2014-08-30\">{{Cite AV media| title = Rooster Teeth panel at PAX Prime 2014\n | publisher = YouTube\n | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzaT0XlDeHs#t=842\n | date = August 30, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n}}<!-- Please keep the above list-defined references in alphabetical order by refname -->\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDB episodes|3066242|RWBY}}\n\n{{Rooster Teeth Productions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RWBY}}\n[[Category:RWBY|*]]\n[[Category:Lists of web series episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''RWBY'' episodes}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n\n''[[RWBY]]'' is an ongoing American web series created by [[Monty Oum]] and produced by [[Rooster Teeth Productions]].

It can be combined naturally or artificially to form stronger types, which Mankind harnessed for technology such as airships or androids. Only skilled and disciplined people can use its raw form without losing control, so the most common use of Dust is in ammunition - though some still use archaic means, like weaving it into clothing or their own body. While part of everyday life, humanity has no understanding of how it came to be - or how mankind's involvement with Dust will change Remnant.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR2\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n   | Title           = Kingdoms\n   | Aux3            = 1:57\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|9|18}}\n   | ShortSummary    = The narrator describes Remnant as a dangerous place for mankind, as many civilizations have grown and fallen over the years. In the present day, only four remain; ''Atlas'' in the north continent and ''Mistral'' in the east, while ''Vacuo'' and ''Vale'' share the largest continent. Protected by natural barriers and human tenacity, each kingdom has a governing council and their own individual militaries - some mandatory, some not. Outside the kingdom walls are roaming nomad tribes and small villages, but most fall to Grimm attacks. Each kingdom has a Huntsmen academy to train the next generations of Huntsmen to protect humanity from the Grimm. Described as beacons of hope and safe havens, the narrator claims they are the key to mankind's survival - as long as they stand united.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR3\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n   | Title           = Grimm\n   | Aux3            = 3:36\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|16}}\n   | ShortSummary    = The narrator details the creatures of Grimm as a destructive force that has existed throughout most of Remnant across known history. Once believed to be evil spirits, further study revealed they continued to evolve and diversify over time like animals. They attack humans and their creations first and foremost, only conflicting with wildlife for territory. Common belief is that Grimm don't need to feed; they choose to. They are drawn to negative emotions - with numbers proportionate to how far panic spreads. Captured Grimm usually break free or die quickly and their bodies evaporate shortly after their death, making study difficult. The narrator concludes that Grimm are not mindless; while younger ones are more reckless, older ones learn from their experiences to be more cautious in the future - a natural adaptation that makes them more effective killers.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR4\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n   | Title           = Aura\n   | Aux3            = 2:00\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|12|9}} (DVD/Blu-ray)\n   | ShortSummary    = The narrator explains Huntsmen are considered Remnant's greatest warriors in large part by mastering Aura; a manifestation of the life force or soul that runs through every living being - save Grimm - but which only true warriors can amplify and control. It is primarily used for defense, sheathing the wielder in a protective force field to help survive otherwise fatal blows -\nthough their reserves deplete with each hit until exhausted, leaving them vulnerable. Aura's second main use is by projecting it into a more tangible form known as a ''Semblance'', providing a special power unique to each wielder such as superhuman strength or telekinesis. The narrator claims that, with enough training and focus, Aura can turn a warrior into far more than a simple man or woman.\n\n[Note: This episode was a DVD/Blu-Ray exclusive.]\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n}}\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Episode table|background=#DAA560 | overall=5 | season=5 | title=17 | aux3=5 | aux3T=Length | airdate=10 | episodes=\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR5\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n   | Title           = Vytal Festival Tournament\n   | Aux3            = 2:40\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|8}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Professor Ozpin explains how the multi-year Great War was ended when humanity's leaders made peace on the island of Vytal, forming new laws, traditions and the Huntsman Academies to create modern society. Among these is the Vytal Festival to celebrate the peacetime every two years, rotating between each kingdom to ensure their cultures remain open to the world. The Vytal Festival's Tournament, a keystone of the event, was designed to test the strength of the kingdom's Huntsman in a safe and friendly environment, the competition ensuring every warrior strives to be their best. As the tournament's rosters grew, the four kingdoms created the Amity Colosseum; a mobile arena that can visit any kingdom in Remnant.

Each kingdom established an academy after the Great War: ''Beacon Academy'' in Vale, ''Haven Academy'' in Mistral, ''Shade Academy'' in Vacuo, and ''Atlas Academy'' in Atlas (originally Mantle). They recruit the most promising graduates from primary combat schools, grouping them in teams of four to develop communication, empathy and teamwork skills. Students are separated from kingdom allegiance while in the Academy and, upon graduating, choose their work and employers, usually via mission boards; kingdom affiliation is by choice. However, Atlas Academy is an exception, scrutinized for indoctrinating a military lifestyle upon its students, pressuring enlistment in the Military's Special Units after graduation. Ozpin states that regardless of the teaching method, the end result is the same: Huntsmen and Huntresses, ready to make their own paths. Some stay in a team, others work alone - all are expected to protect and serve humanity, never succumbing to the darkness.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR7\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n   | Title           = Cross Continental Transmit System\n   | Aux3            = 3:07\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|26}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Ozpin details the history of the Cross Continental Transmit System (CCTS), before which kingdoms could only communicate within their borders by radio or across borders with physical messages, the latter of which were always endangered by Grimm. Establishing relay satellites was impractical because spaceflight was impossible, as known Dust types lose their powers outside Remnant's atmosphere, so Atlas instead developed a series of four tower-housed wireless-signal hubs - one in each kingdom. While allowing an online web and communication accessible via handheld \"scrolls\", connectivity suffers the further one is from a kingdom, with attempts at smaller support towers suffering from Grimm attacks. Despite the benefits of global communication, Ozpin notes the system's fatal flaw is that losing even one of the towers will take down the entire network, describing it a poetic irony that Remnant's people must either speak as one or not speak at all.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR8\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n   | Title           = The Four Maidens\n   | Aux3            = 7:02\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|1|23}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Ozpin tells the tale of the Four Maidens; An old wizard living in the woods sees a maiden, Winter, waiting outside in the snow for her sisters, falling asleep from the serenity she brings. When he wakes, he sees another maiden, Spring, also waiting for her sisters and planting seeds to create a beautiful garden. The wizard watches until he hears laughter from a third waiting maiden, Summer, who convinces the wizard to step outside and embrace the world. They prepare a feast together just as the fourth sister, Fall, arrives and asks the wizard's name when he invites her. The Wizard claims he is uninteresting and has nothing to his name despite centuries of life, but Fall remarks otherwise and convinces him he has everything he needs in life. The wizard asks why they helped him with his loneliness, with Fall's answer being they would do so for anyone. Repaying their kindness, the wizard bestows his magic upon the sisters, gifting them control over the elements of nature. The sisters promise to use their gifts to aid others and to  visit their friend every year.\n\n[Note: A shortened version of the tale of the Four Maidens was also told by Pyrrha Nikos (Vol. 3, Ch. 6)]\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n}}\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Episode table|background=#DAA560 | overall=5 | season=5 | title=17 | aux3=5 | aux3T=Length | airdate=10 | episodes=\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR9\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n   | Title           = Vale\n   | Aux3            = 2:23\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|17}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow introduces Remnant; a world where towns constantly rise and fall against Grimm. Currently, the Faunus race holds the island continent of Menagerie, while the four kingdoms - Vale, Mistral, Atlas, Vacuo - are the \"sweet spots\" to live in. Vale, located on the northeastern end of the largest continent Sanus, is a kingdom protected by two natural barriers - mountains in the east and shallow waters on the northwest-coast, making it very defensible. The kingdom consists of Vale - its namesake main city - along with a few smaller cities along the northwest coastline. There is also the small island of Patch, off the coast across from the capital, which Qrow claims a nice place to raise a family - as Ruby and Yang were. Attempts to extend the kingdom past the mountains, such as the Mountain Glenn project, have been colossal failures. Qrow states Vale is \"not half bad\", as regular climate, natural barriers and serious border defense enable citizens to live their lives instead of fighting for survival, though the Fall of Beacon has now left people concerned.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR10\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n   | Title           = Mistral\n   | Aux3            = 2:20\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|18}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow narrates the landmass to the east of Sanus as the second largest continent of Remnant, Anima, where  the kingdom of Mistral is located. Mistral has the largest territory of any kingdom, home to a wide variety of ecosystems and lifestyles. Its high society is known for fashion, architecture and theater, while the lower class \"has a fame of its own\"; the biggest black market in Remnant where one can hire thieves, assassins and thugs of all kinds. However, all of Mistral's inhabitants have something in common: their respect for nature, especially the sea and sky. Qrow states that natural resources had an impact on Mistral's culture and technology, starting with the first settlers who found shelter in its wind-carved cliffs, from where they expanded into the land. A huge problem for its government is the kingdom's sheer size, which enables a lot of outlaws hide there\u2014while the capital is mostly secure, other cities like Windpath and Kuchinashi are harder to govern. Qrow concludes that there are a lot of places to hide, though one has to know where to look to find certain people.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR11\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n   | Title           = Atlas\n   | Aux3            = 3:12\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow voices a low opinion of most Atlas citizens. Both the youngest and arguably most successful kingdom, it was originally called Mantle and founded by settlers who, for unknown reasons, traveled to the northernmost continent, Solitas. The cold climate and large mountains protected settlers from Grimm - but only if they could adapt themselves, developing advanced technology faster than the rest of Remnant. The \"Great War\" gave Mantle another boost, as new forms of Dust application, weaponry, research and mining allowed it to expand. The territory around its combat school, Alsius, was used to build new facilities. After the \"Great War\", Alsius was renamed as Atlas and took in many war veterans, using New Dust technologies to enhance its grounds and secure surrounding areas. Eventually, the military, labs, research facilities and residential areas moved to Atlas as well. When the new city outgrew Mantle, the capital was moved there and the kingdom itself renamed as Atlas. Qrow remarks that while some people called it \"a golden age of prosperity\", the people left in Mantle felt it \"the coldest winter they ever knew.\"\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n   | EpisodeNumber   = WR12\n   | EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n   | Title           = Vacuo\n   | Aux3            = 2:58\n   | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|20}}\n   | ShortSummary    = Qrow remarks Vacuo may be worse off than Mantle was. Located at the western end of Sanus, it was once \"a paradise\"- an oasis in the surrounding desert bursting with natural resources, geographical defenses and the world's largest Dust deposits. Many nomads settled a thriving lifestyle, but their society became complacent while the rest of the world had to adapt to survive. Soon, the other kingdoms set their eyes on Vacuo's resources, sparking what would be the \"Great War\". After years of conflict, unrestricted mining and ecological disasters, Vauco was reduced to a barren wasteland: citizens live in makeshift homes, traveling frequently in response to fleeting resources or occasional Grimm attacks. While still a kingdom, its formal government goes unheeded by citizens with Shade Academy considered the only source of order. However, its citizens still have a mutual respect for one another, following an unspoken rule: \"If you can survive here, then you're welcome here.\" Qrow recalls how Ozpin said the four kingdoms represented what mankind is capable of when working together, lamenting that they would need Ozpin now to do so.\n   | LineColor       = DAA560\n }}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR13\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n  | Title           = Between Kingdoms\n  | Aux3            = 3:18\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|12|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = Qrow narrates how areas between kingdoms are mostly populated by Grimm. Trained Huntsmen and Huntresses should be fine on the roads unless they meet large packs. Small villages and towns also dot the land, inhabited by people who either don't want to deal with life in the kingdoms, are upset with how the kingdoms are governed or simply prefer independence. If a town is founded by \"smart\" people, it can survive the same way the kingdoms do: with natural barriers and strong defenses - or else frequent Grimm attacks will likely destroy them within a year. Another problem is wandering bandits tribes; groups of usually-skilled fighters who prey on convoys, tending to attack and pillage weaker towns. Attacks by Grimm or bandits are usually concurrent; If a town survived a bandit attack, the lingering negative emotions may attract Grimm - and in reverse, raiders will attack towns the Grimm have weakened. Bandits never stay in one place long, as the Grimm threaten them as well. According to Qrow, almost all of Remnant has been mapped, but there are some areas from where nobody has returned alive - places where \"she\" (Salem) could possibly be.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR14\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n  | Title           = Faunus\n  | Aux3            = 4:40\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|26|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = A humanoid species, notable for each having a single animalistic trait\u2014such as cat ears. Existing at least as long as mankind, Faunus are genetically compatible with humans, though any such union will always produce Faunus children. Qrow narrates the history of Faunus and humans as full of conflicts; in ancient times, humans were afraid of Faunus and either avoided them, pushed them out of settlements or brutally hunted them. Humans began to outnumber and exploit them\u2014such as making them cheap labor force\u2014and the Faunus saw them as a threat. But when Grimm attacked a village in Sanus, it became a turning point as the two races united to defend their home against a shared enemy. Another milestone was after the \"Great War; Remnant was desperate for compromises and one of them involved the Faunus, who were awarded equal rights as citizens and received the island continent of Menagerie to govern for themselves. However, Qrow states this was still a bad deal for the Faunus; while they live all over Remnant, the quality of their treatment varies in different regions, with a lot of Faunus withdrawing from the kingdoms to live packed together on Menagerie.

Its founder Nikolas Schnee, son of a Dust miner, was born in Mantle after the end of the \"Great War\", during the kingdom's transformative period in which it depended on others for Dust resources. Nikolas worked in the mines, went to combat school and studied. After his father's death, Nikolas used his small inheritance to fund an expedition for new Dust deposits and founded the SDC off its success. Known for quality, affordability, and trust, Nikolas personally oversaw every expedition and expansion, gaining the trust of his men and opening businesses in every kingdom. However, following years of working in Dust mines, Nikolas was forced into early retirement mostly because of health issues. A man named Jacques Gel\u00e9 then married Nikolas' daughter, took on the Schnee name and convinced Nikolas that he was the \"right\" successor. Jacques is a \"cunning businessman\" whose leadership made the SDC more profitable than ever, dominating the industry - though with many questionable methods: cheap labor forces, dangerous working conditions, destroying competition and company propaganda. In Qrow's opinion, Jacques only cares about winning - and with him in charge, the future of the once-good Schnee name is uncertain.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n{{Episode list\n  | EpisodeNumber   = WR16\n  | EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n  | Title           = The Great War\n  | Aux3            = 7:20\n  | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|14|20}}\n  | ShortSummary   = The \"Great War\" lasted around ten years, preceded by a century of tension. Mistral had conquered Anima and made an alliance with Mantle, exchanging of supplies and technology. An \"incident\" in Mantle led to a decree that abolished the arts and repressed self-expression, attempting to control the citizens' emotions to reduce Grimm attacks, to which Mistral partly complied when Mantle tried to enforce the decree in other kingdoms. This and other issues, such as Mistral and Mantle's treatment of citizens or maintenance of slavery, caused conflicts with Vale's citizens, resulting in a clash when Mistral tried to expand to the east coast of Sanus. The king of Vale avoided conflict, but the opposing settlers did not, their riot sparking the first battle of the \"Great War\". Mantle supported Mistral, with battles starting in both Anima and Sanus. Grimm attacked all combatants, sometimes forcing cease-fires between the humans to deal with the monsters. Vacuo initially stayed neutral until Mantle and Mistral tried to force their cooperation, instead supporting Vale in fear of the other side's victory. The war ended with the \"Vacuo campaign\", Mistral and Mantle attempting to claim Vacuo's Dust mines and cut off supplies for their enemies. The king of Vale led his and Vacuo's forces and, armed with crown, sword and scepter, he decimated the enemy army. The \"deadliest battle of the war\" cost many lives and created the legend of the \"Warrior King\". In the end, everyone bowed to the king of Vale, who refused to rule over Remnant and established the treaty of Vytal instead; territories were redistributed, slavery abolished, and governments restructured. The last king of Vale founded the Huntsmen academies and gave his most trusted followers command over them, promising to teach mankind how to fight on the condition it was not against each other; a bargain Qrow says mankind has not honored.\n\n  | LineColor       = DAA560\n}}\n}}\n\n==Home media==\n{{expand section|date=July 2017}}\n\n[[Cinedigm]] has released box sets for each season of ''RWBY''. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 70%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Volume\n! scope=\"column\"| Release date\n! width=\"5%\" | Ref.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" width=\"1%\" style=\"background: black;\" |\n| 1\n| November 12, 2013\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-Barbara-Dunkelman/dp/B00DP4YC7U/|title=RWBY|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref> \n|-\n| 2\n| December 9, 2014\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-2-Lindsey-Tuggey/dp/B00NLZA8E4/|title=RWBY: Volume 2|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref> \n|-\n| 3\n| May 3, 2016\n| <ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-3-None/dp/B01BLX0UBS/|title=RWBY: Volume 3|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| 4\n| June 6, 2017\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/45092/rwbyvolume4.html|title=Blu-ray Releases Details RWBY: Volume 4|publisher=High-Def Digest|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-4-None/dp/B06XKS41H2/|title=RWBY: Volume 4|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| 5\n| June 5, 2018\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-5-None/dp/B07BC6KQWJ/|title=RWBY: Volume 5|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| 6\n| July 2, 2019\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/RWBY-6-Barbara-Dunkelman/dp/B07QDSKFL7/|title=RWBY: Volume 6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn Japan, Volume 1 was released on DVD and Blu-ray by [[Warner Bros.]] Japan on December 9, 2015, with a Japanese dub.<ref>{{ cite web | url=https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1441877147 | title=\u5317\u7c73\u767a\u306e\u7f8e\u5c11\u59733DCG\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300eRWBY\u300f\u524d\u91ce\u667a\u662d\u3055\u3093\u3089\u8ffd\u52a0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c83\u540d\u304c\u89e3\u7981\uff01\u3000\u5287\u5834\u3067\u306e\u5148\u884c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u4e0a\u6620\u3082\u6c7a\u5b9a | language=Japanese | publisher=[[Animate]] | date=2015-09-10 | accessdate=2017-12-10 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em| refs = <!-- Please keep the following list-defined references in alphabetical order by refname -->\n\n<ref name=\"anime\">{{Cite web| title = FEATURE: Inside Rooster Teeth's \"RWBY\"\n | last = Rush | first = Amanda\n | publisher = Crunchyroll\n | url = http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/07/12/feature-inside-rooster-teeths-rwby\n | date = July 12, 2013 | access-date = July 18, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crunchyroll.com 2013-08-16\">{{Cite web| title = Crunchroll to simulcast \"RWBY\"\n | url = http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-press-release/2013/08/16/crunchyroll-to-simulcast-rwby\n | date = August 16, 2013 | access-date = August 22, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"discretion\">{{Cite web| title = On RWBY and Viewer Discretion...\n | author = Haddock, Gray\n | publisher = [[Rooster Teeth]]\n | url = http://roosterteeth.com/post/51193367\n | date = January 1, 2016 | access-date = March 5, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RT 2013-07-18\">{{Cite web| title = RWBY Pre-Show Live Stream\n | publisher = [[Rooster Teeth]] | via = [[YouTube]]\n | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dleqek092RM\n | date = July 18, 2013 | access-date = September 8, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Vol 2 announce\">{{Cite web| title = RWBY Vol 2 will premiere at RTX July 4\u20136 this year!\n | last = Oum | first = Monty\n | author-link = Monty Oum\n | publisher = [[Twitter]]\n | url = https://twitter.com/montyoum/status/428969903883030528\n | date = January 30, 2014 | access-date = January 30, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"YouTube 2013-07-15\">{{Cite web| title = Rooster Teeth Podcast #227\n | publisher = [[YouTube]]\n | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HlUnZdLBOU\n | date = July 15, 2013 | access-date = July 29, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"YouTube 2014-08-30\">{{Cite AV media| title = Rooster Teeth panel at PAX Prime 2014\n | publisher = YouTube\n | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzaT0XlDeHs#t=842\n | date = August 30, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n}}<!-- Please keep the above list-defined references in alphabetical order by refname -->\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDB episodes|3066242|RWBY}}\n\n{{Rooster Teeth Productions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RWBY}}\n[[Category:RWBY|*]]\n[[Category:Lists of web series episodes]]\n", "name_user": "2605:a601:ac99:6a00:b1b2:b4a9:1f3c:3e98", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSeries overview)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RWBY_episodes"}

First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]].

The team repeated this success in the next season, when they won second title of Polish Champion in four final matches with [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]], and Polish Cup for the second year in a row (winning final match with [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] (3-0)).

[[Capital expenditures|Capitalization]] of items producing future benefit can be required, though with some exceptions. A deduction is allowed, for example, on interest paid on student loans.<ref name=\"simple\"/>  Some systems allow taxpayer deductions for items the influential parties want to encourage as purchases.\n\n==Business expenses==\nNearly all jurisdictions that tax business income allow deductions for business and trade expenses.  Allowances vary and may be general or restricted.  To be deducted, the expenses must be incurred in furthering business, and usually only include activities undertaken for profit.\n\n===Cost of goods sold===\nNearly all income tax systems allow a deduction for the [[cost of goods sold]]. This may be considered an expense, a reduction of [[gross income]],<ref>PRATHAM MANGAT system computes taxable income by subtracting deductions from gross income.  Gross income, under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61- 26 USC 61] is defined as gains from the sale of property plus other income.  Gains, in turn, are defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001- 26 USC 1001] as the amount realized less the adjusted basis of property sold.</ref> or merely a component utilized in computing net profits.<ref>The UK system computes income chargeable to tax as net business profits, plus other income, with adjustments.  In such systems, the locally recognized generally accepted accounting principles apply.  See, e.g., IAS 2, Inventories.</ref>  The manner in which cost of goods sold is determined has several inherent complexities, including various accounting methods. These include:\n*Conventions for assigning costs to particular goods sold where specific identification is infeasible.<ref>Examples of alternatives to specific identification include first-in-first-out (FIFO), average cost, and last-in-first-out (LIFO).  Many EU countries do not permit LIFO.</ref>\n*Methods for attributing common costs, such as factory burden, to particular goods.<ref>Among the methods commonly used are:  i) factory burden rate, in which overhead costs are assigned  to goods produced based on labor hours or labor dollars;  ii) standard costs, in which a cost including overheads is periodically determined for each type of goods and inventory and cost of goods sold are adjusted periodically for variances of actual costs from such standards; and  iii) activity based costing, in which costs are assigned based on factors which drive the incurrence of such costs.  Numerous variations on these are available in many systems.</ref>\n*Methods for determining when costs are recognized in computing cost of goods sold or to be sold.<ref>Generally, determinations depend upon the overall method of accounting or overarching principles of local GAAP.  These include the cash receipts and disbursements method, accrual methods, and deferred cost methods.  Under these principles there may be a need to determine when amounts are properly treated as incurred.</ref>\n*Methods for recognizing costs of goods that will not be sold or have declined in value.<ref>GAAP often requires that the decline in value of unsold goods be charged to income when the decline occurs.  This is often accomplished through a lower of cost or market value inventory accounting method,  or inventory reserves.  Some systems provide for differences in these determinations for financial reporting and tax purposes.</ref>\n\n===Trading or ordinary and necessary business expenses===\nMany systems, including the [[United Kingdom]], levy tax on all chargeable \u201cprofits of a trade\u201d computed under local [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).<ref>[ UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988 (ICTA) section {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}]. The HMRC Business Income Manual at [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31001.htm BIM 31001] states that \"the starting point is accounts prepared in accordance with ordinary principles of commercial accountancy, and the commercial profits are then adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Taxes Acts.\"</ref> Under this approach, determination of whether an item is deductible depends upon accounting rules and judgments. By contrast, the U.S. allows as a deduction \"all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business...\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(a)].</ref> subject to qualifications, enhancements, and limitations.<ref>Johnston, Kevin. \"A List of Deductible Business Expenses for Schedule C.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/list-deductible-business-expenses-schedule-c-21156.html. 29 June 2018.</ref> A similar approach is followed by Canada, but generally with fewer special rules. Such an approach poses significant definitional issues. Among the definitional issues often addressed are:\n*What constitutes a trade or business?  Generally, the business must be regular, continuous, substantial, and entered into with an expectation of profit.<ref>In this regard, the [[United States Tax Court]] has issued well in excess of one thousand rulings.  Among the factors considered are:  a) whether the transactions are regular and continuous (discussed, e.g., prior to the income tax in Lewellyn v. Pittsburgh, B. & L. E. R. Co., 222 Fed. 177 (CA3, 1915), a case cited by the Tax Court), (b) whether  the purported business is substantial (see, e.g., {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}), (c) whether the transactions were profit motivated (see, e.g., Doggett v. Burnet, (1933) , 65 F2d 191; also see hobby loss rules at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/183- 26 USC 183]).</ref><ref>[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim20200.htm UK Business Income Manual 20200] describes various badges of trade.</ref>\n*What expenses are ordinary and necessary?  The phrase deals with what expenses are appropriate to the nature of the business, whether the expenses are of the sort expected to help produce income and promote the business, and whether the expenses are not lavish and extravagant.\n\nNote that under this concept, the same sorts of expenses are generally deductible by business entities and individuals carrying on a trade or business.  To the extent such expenses relate to the employment of an individual and are not reimbursed by the employer, the amount may be deductible by the individual.<ref>See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2106.pdf IRS Form 2106].</ref>\n\nBusiness deductions of flow-through entities may flow through as a component of the entity's net income in some jurisdictions.  Deductions of flow-through entities may pass through to members of such entities separately from the net income of the entity in some jurisdictions or some cases.  For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all deductions of partnerships (and [[S corporations]] in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or [[S corporation]] shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/704- 26 USC 704(b)] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170].</ref>\n\n===Accounting methods===\n{{main|Tax accounting}}\nOne important aspect of determining tax deductions for business expenses is the timing of such deduction.  The method used for this is commonly referred to as an accounting method.  Accounting methods for tax purposes may differ from applicable [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]].  Examples include timing of recognition of cost recovery deductions (e.g., depreciation), current expensing of otherwise capitalizable costs of intangibles,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/174- 26 USC 174].</ref> and rules related to costs that should be treated  as part of cost of goods not yet sold.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263A- 26 USC 263A].</ref>  Further, taxpayers often have choices among multiple accounting methods permissible under GAAP and/or tax rules.  Examples include conventions for determining which goods have been sold (such as first-in-first-out, average cost, etc.), whether or not to defer minor expenses producing benefit in the immediately succeeding period, etc.\n\nAccounting methods may be defined with some precision by tax law, as in the U.S. system, or may be based on GAAP, as in the UK system.\n\n===Limits on deductions===\nMany systems limit particular deductions, even where the expenses directly relate to the business.  Such limitations may, by way of example, include:\n*Maximum deductions for use of automobiles<ref>UK:  [ ICTA __], [ ].  U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280F- 26 USC 280F].</ref>\n*Limits on deducting compensation of certain key employees<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(m)].</ref>\n*Limits on lobbying or similar expenditures<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(e)].</ref>\n*Nondeductibility of payments considered in violation of public policy, such as criminal fines<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(f)].</ref>\n*Limits on deductions for business-related entertainment.<ref>U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/274- 26 USC 274(n)].</ref>\n\nIn addition, deductions in excess of income in one endeavor may not be allowed to offset income from other endeavors.  For example, the United States limits deductions related to passive activities to income from passive activities.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/469- 26 USC 469].  Income from passive activities includes not only operating income but also gains from disposition of the activity or assets used in the activity.  See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p925.pdf Publication 925].</ref>\n\nIn particular, expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include:  \n*     The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges;\n*     The cost of storing products the business sells;\n*     Direct labor costs for workers who produce the products; and\n*     Factory overhead expenses.\n\nIn 2005, the Australian government amended its taxation legislation to remove deductions for expenses incurred in conducting criminal business activities. This came after the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] ruled in ''[[Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa]]'' that a heroin dealer was entitled to a tax deduction for money stolen from him in a drug deal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Taxation of illegal activities in Australia and New Zealand|first=Ranjana|last=Gupta|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JlATaxTA/2008/12.pdf|journal=Journal of the Australasian Tax Teachers Association|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=106\u2013128}}</ref>\n\n==Capitalized items and cost recovery (depreciation)==\nMany systems require that the cost of items likely to produce future benefits be capitalized.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263- 26 USC 263]; International Financial Reporting Standards ([IFRS]), particularly IAS 16, applicable in most EU jurisdictions for determining business profits as the starting point for taxable income.</ref>  Examples include plant and equipment, fees related to acquisition o of developing [[intangible asset]]s (e.g., patentable inventions).  Such systems often allow a tax deduction for cost recovery in a future period.\n\nA common approach to such cost recovery is to allow a deduction for a portion of the cost ratably over some period of years.  The U.S. system refers to such a cost recovery deduction as [[depreciation]] for costs of tangible assets<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168], which prescribes depreciable lives by broad class;</ref> and as [[amortization]] for costs of intangible assets.  Depreciation in these systems is allowed over an estimated useful life, which may be assigned by the government for numerous classes of assets, based on the nature and use of the asset and the nature of the business.<ref>For lives by class of assets, see: U.S. see Rev. Proc. 87-56, as updated, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946]; Canada Income Tax Regulations section 1100 et seq.</ref>  The annual depreciation deduction may be computed on a straight line, declining balance, or other basis, as permitted in each country's rules.<ref>The U.S. permits declining balance switching to straight line in a particular year, by life of asset class.  See Rev. Proc. 87-57, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946] for percentages that may be used at the option of the taxpayer.</ref>  Many systems allow amortization of the cost of intangible assets only on a straight-line basis, generally computed monthly over the actual expected life or a government specified life.<ref>For international government specified lives by class of intangible asset, see the table in [http://www.taxamortisation.com/tax-amortisation-benefit.html Tax amortization lives of intangible assets]</ref>\n\nAlternative approaches are used by some systems.  Some systems allow a fixed percentage or dollar amount of cost recovery in particular years, often called \u201ccapital allowances.\u201d<ref>UK:  ICTA , ___; Canada: [ Income Tax Act section 20.(1(a))], which provides for deduction as provided in regulations; see [ Income Tax Regulations Part XI, sections 1100 et seq], Capital Allowances.</ref>  This may be determined by reference to the type of asset or business.<ref>Canadian rules cited above specify more than 30 classes for which specific percentages are allowed.</ref>  Some systems allow specific charges for cost recovery for some assets upon certain identifiable events.<ref>For example, Germany allows a deduction for \u201cdepreciation\u201d for assets that have come to be worth significantly less than their unrecovered cost due to identifiable events.  English language {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.</ref>\n\nCapitalization may be required for some items without the potential for cost recovery until disposition or abandonment of the asset to which the capitalized costs relate.  This is often the case for costs related to the formation or reorganization of a corporation, or certain expenses in corporate acquisitions.<ref>See [[INDOPCO]] v. Commissioner.</ref>  However, some systems provide for amortization of certain such costs, at the election of the taxpayer.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/248- 26 USC 248] for corporations, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/709- 26 USC 709] for partnerships.</ref>\n\n==Non-business expenses==\nSome systems distinguish between an active trade or business and the holding of assets to produce income.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/212- 26 USC 212]; UK [ ICTA ].</ref>  In such systems, there may be additional limitations on the timing and nature of amounts that may be claimed as tax deductions.  Many of the rules, including accounting methods and limits on deductions, that apply to business expenses also apply to income producing expenses.\n\n===Losses===\n{{See also|Loss on sale of residential property}}\nMany systems allow a deduction for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets.  This deduction may be limited to gains from the same class of assets.  In the U.S., a loss on non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains.  Also, in the U.S. a loss on the sale of the taxpayer's principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.\n\n===Personal deductions===\nMany jurisdictions allow certain classes of taxpayers to reduce taxable income for certain inherently personal items.  A common such deduction is a fixed allowance for the taxpayer and certain family members or other persons supported by the taxpayer.  The U.S. allows such a deduction for \u201cpersonal exemptions\u201d for the taxpayer and certain members of the taxpayer's household.<ref>26 USC 151, 152.  The amount is adjusted annually for inflation, and was [https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=177992,00.html $3,650] for 2009.</ref>  The UK grants a \u201c[[personal allowance]].\u201d<ref>For 2009, the amount was [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm \u00a36,475], with additional allowances for married couples over age 75.</ref>  Both U.S. and UK allowances are phased out for individuals or married couples with income in excess of specified levels.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions allow reduction of taxable income for certain categories of expenses not incurred in connection with a business or investments.  In the U.S. system, these (as well as certain business or investment expenses) are referred to as \u201c[[itemized deductions]]\u201d for individuals.  The UK allows a few of these as personal reliefs.  These include, for example, the following for U.S. residents (and UK residents as noted):\n*Medical expenses (in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income)<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/213- 26 USC 213].</ref>\n*State and local income and property taxes<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/164- 26 USC 164(a)(2)].

Generally, the deduction is limited to 50% of gross income.  This limitation is reduced in certain circumstances.  Amounts in excess of the limitation may be deducted in future years, also subject to limitations.</ref>\n*Losses on non-income-producing property due to casualty or theft,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/165- 26 USC 165].</ref>\n*Contribution to certain retirement or health savings plans (U.S. and UK),<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/219- 26 USC 219], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201c401(k)\u201d and \u201cIRA\u201d plans, among others, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223- 26 USC 223], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201chealth savings accounts\u201d that are used to pay for medical expenses.</ref>\n*Certain educational expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/221- 26 USC 221] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/222- 222].</ref>\n\nMany systems provide that an individual may claim a tax deduction for personal payments that, upon payment, become taxable to another person, such as alimony.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/215- 26 USC 215].</ref>  Such systems generally require, at a minimum, reporting of such amounts,<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf Form IRS Form 1040], line 31b.</ref> and may require that [[withholding tax]] be applied to the payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p504/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000175944|title=Publication 504 (2017), Divorced or Separated Individuals - Internal Revenue Service|author=|date=|website=www.irs.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Groups of taxpayers==\nSome systems allow a deduction to a company or other entity for expenses or losses of another company or entity if the two companies or entities are commonly controlled.  Such deduction may be referred to as \u201cgroup relief.\u201d<ref>UK [S380 ICTA et seq ]</ref>  Generally, such deductions function in lieu of consolidated or combined computation of tax ([[tax consolidation]]) for such groups.

[[Capital expenditures|Capitalization]] of items producing future benefit can be required, though with some exceptions. A deduction is allowed, for example, on interest paid on student loans.<ref name=\"simple\"/>  Some systems allow taxpayer deductions for items the influential parties want to encourage as purchases.\n\n==Business expenses==\nNearly all jurisdictions that tax business income allow deductions for business and trade expenses.  Allowances vary and may be general or restricted.  To be deducted, the expenses must be incurred in furthering business, and usually only include activities undertaken for profit.\n\n===Cost of goods sold===\nNearly all income tax systems allow a deduction for the [[cost of goods sold]]. This may be considered an expense, a reduction of [[gross income]],<ref>PRATHAM MANGAT system computes taxable income by subtracting deductions from gross income.  Gross income, under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61- 26 USC 61] is defined as gains from the sale of property plus other income.  Gains, in turn, are defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001- 26 USC 1001] as the amount realized less the adjusted basis of property sold.</ref> or merely a component utilized in computing net profits.<ref>The UK system computes income chargeable to tax as net business profits, plus other income, with adjustments.  In such systems, the locally recognized generally accepted accounting principles apply.  See, e.g., IAS 2, Inventories.</ref>  The manner in which cost of goods sold is determined has several inherent complexities, including various accounting methods. These include:\n*Conventions for assigning costs to particular goods sold where specific identification is infeasible.<ref>Examples of alternatives to specific identification include first-in-first-out (FIFO), average cost, and last-in-first-out (LIFO).  Many EU countries do not permit LIFO.</ref>\n*Methods for attributing common costs, such as factory burden, to particular goods.<ref>Among the methods commonly used are:  i) factory burden rate, in which overhead costs are assigned  to goods produced based on labor hours or labor dollars;  ii) standard costs, in which a cost including overheads is periodically determined for each type of goods and inventory and cost of goods sold are adjusted periodically for variances of actual costs from such standards; and  iii) activity based costing, in which costs are assigned based on factors which drive the incurrence of such costs.  Numerous variations on these are available in many systems.</ref>\n*Methods for determining when costs are recognized in computing cost of goods sold or to be sold.<ref>Generally, determinations depend upon the overall method of accounting or overarching principles of local GAAP.  These include the cash receipts and disbursements method, accrual methods, and deferred cost methods.  Under these principles there may be a need to determine when amounts are properly treated as incurred.</ref>\n*Methods for recognizing costs of goods that will not be sold or have declined in value.<ref>GAAP often requires that the decline in value of unsold goods be charged to income when the decline occurs.  This is often accomplished through a lower of cost or market value inventory accounting method,  or inventory reserves.  Some systems provide for differences in these determinations for financial reporting and tax purposes.</ref>\n\n===Trading or ordinary and necessary business expenses===\nMany systems, including the [[United Kingdom]], levy tax on all chargeable \u201cprofits of a trade\u201d computed under local [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).<ref>[ UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988 (ICTA) section {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}]. The HMRC Business Income Manual at [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31001.htm BIM 31001] states that \"the starting point is accounts prepared in accordance with ordinary principles of commercial accountancy, and the commercial profits are then adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Taxes Acts.\"</ref> Under this approach, determination of whether an item is deductible depends upon accounting rules and judgments. By contrast, the U.S. allows as a deduction \"all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business...\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(a)].</ref> subject to qualifications, enhancements, and limitations.<ref>Johnston, Kevin. \"A List of Deductible Business Expenses for Schedule C.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/list-deductible-business-expenses-schedule-c-21156.html. 29 June 2018.</ref> A similar approach is followed by Canada, but generally with fewer special rules. Such an approach poses significant definitional issues. Among the definitional issues often addressed are:\n*What constitutes a trade or business?  Generally, the business must be regular, continuous, substantial, and entered into with an expectation of profit.<ref>In this regard, the [[United States Tax Court]] has issued well in excess of one thousand rulings.  Among the factors considered are:  a) whether the transactions are regular and continuous (discussed, e.g., prior to the income tax in Lewellyn v. Pittsburgh, B. & L. E. R. Co., 222 Fed. 177 (CA3, 1915), a case cited by the Tax Court), (b) whether  the purported business is substantial (see, e.g., {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}), (c) whether the transactions were profit motivated (see, e.g., Doggett v. Burnet, (1933) , 65 F2d 191; also see hobby loss rules at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/183- 26 USC 183]).</ref><ref>[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim20200.htm UK Business Income Manual 20200] describes various badges of trade.</ref>\n*What expenses are ordinary and necessary?  The phrase deals with what expenses are appropriate to the nature of the business, whether the expenses are of the sort expected to help produce income and promote the business, and whether the expenses are not lavish and extravagant.\n\nNote that under this concept, the same sorts of expenses are generally deductible by business entities and individuals carrying on a trade or business.  To the extent such expenses relate to the employment of an individual and are not reimbursed by the employer, the amount may be deductible by the individual.<ref>See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2106.pdf IRS Form 2106].</ref>\n\nBusiness deductions of flow-through entities may flow through as a component of the entity's net income in some jurisdictions.  Deductions of flow-through entities may pass through to members of such entities separately from the net income of the entity in some jurisdictions or some cases.  For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all deductions of partnerships (and [[S corporations]] in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or [[S corporation]] shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/704- 26 USC 704(b)] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170].</ref>\n\n===Accounting methods===\n{{main|Tax accounting}}\nOne important aspect of determining tax deductions for business expenses is the timing of such deduction.  The method used for this is commonly referred to as an accounting method.  Accounting methods for tax purposes may differ from applicable [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]].  Examples include timing of recognition of cost recovery deductions (e.g., depreciation), current expensing of otherwise capitalizable costs of intangibles,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/174- 26 USC 174].</ref> and rules related to costs that should be treated  as part of cost of goods not yet sold.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263A- 26 USC 263A].</ref>  Further, taxpayers often have choices among multiple accounting methods permissible under GAAP and/or tax rules.  Examples include conventions for determining which goods have been sold (such as first-in-first-out, average cost, etc.), whether or not to defer minor expenses producing benefit in the immediately succeeding period, etc.\n\nAccounting methods may be defined with some precision by tax law, as in the U.S. system, or may be based on GAAP, as in the UK system.\n\n===Limits on deductions===\nMany systems limit particular deductions, even where the expenses directly relate to the business.  Such limitations may, by way of example, include:\n*Maximum deductions for use of automobiles<ref>UK:  [ ICTA __], [ ].  U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280F- 26 USC 280F].</ref>\n*Limits on deducting compensation of certain key employees<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(m)].</ref>\n*Limits on lobbying or similar expenditures<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(e)].</ref>\n*Nondeductibility of payments considered in violation of public policy, such as criminal fines<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(f)].</ref>\n*Limits on deductions for business-related entertainment.<ref>U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/274- 26 USC 274(n)].</ref>\n\nIn addition, deductions in excess of income in one endeavor may not be allowed to offset income from other endeavors.  For example, the United States limits deductions related to passive activities to income from passive activities.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/469- 26 USC 469].  Income from passive activities includes not only operating income but also gains from disposition of the activity or assets used in the activity.  See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p925.pdf Publication 925].</ref>\n\nIn particular, expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include:  \n*     The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges;\n*     The cost of storing products the business sells;\n*     Direct labor costs for workers who produce the products; and\n*     Factory overhead expenses.\n\nIn 2005, the Australian government amended its taxation legislation to remove deductions for expenses incurred in conducting criminal business activities. This came after the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] ruled in ''[[Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa]]'' that a heroin dealer was entitled to a tax deduction for money stolen from him in a drug deal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Taxation of illegal activities in Australia and New Zealand|first=Ranjana|last=Gupta|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JlATaxTA/2008/12.pdf|journal=Journal of the Australasian Tax Teachers Association|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=106\u2013128}}</ref>\n\n==Capitalized items and cost recovery (depreciation)==\nMany systems require that the cost of items likely to produce future benefits be capitalized.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263- 26 USC 263]; International Financial Reporting Standards ([IFRS]), particularly IAS 16, applicable in most EU jurisdictions for determining business profits as the starting point for taxable income.</ref>  Examples include plant and equipment, fees related to acquisition o of developing [[intangible asset]]s (e.g., patentable inventions).  Such systems often allow a tax deduction for cost recovery in a future period.\n\nA common approach to such cost recovery is to allow a deduction for a portion of the cost ratably over some period of years.  The U.S. system refers to such a cost recovery deduction as [[depreciation]] for costs of tangible assets<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168], which prescribes depreciable lives by broad class;</ref> and as [[amortization]] for costs of intangible assets.  Depreciation in these systems is allowed over an estimated useful life, which may be assigned by the government for numerous classes of assets, based on the nature and use of the asset and the nature of the business.<ref>For lives by class of assets, see: U.S. see Rev. Proc. 87-56, as updated, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946]; Canada Income Tax Regulations section 1100 et seq.</ref>  The annual depreciation deduction may be computed on a straight line, declining balance, or other basis, as permitted in each country's rules.<ref>The U.S. permits declining balance switching to straight line in a particular year, by life of asset class.  See Rev. Proc. 87-57, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946] for percentages that may be used at the option of the taxpayer.</ref>  Many systems allow amortization of the cost of intangible assets only on a straight-line basis, generally computed monthly over the actual expected life or a government specified life.<ref>For international government specified lives by class of intangible asset, see the table in [http://www.taxamortisation.com/tax-amortisation-benefit.html Tax amortization lives of intangible assets]</ref>\n\nAlternative approaches are used by some systems.  Some systems allow a fixed percentage or dollar amount of cost recovery in particular years, often called \u201ccapital allowances.\u201d<ref>UK:  ICTA , ___; Canada: [ Income Tax Act section 20.(1(a))], which provides for deduction as provided in regulations; see [ Income Tax Regulations Part XI, sections 1100 et seq], Capital Allowances.</ref>  This may be determined by reference to the type of asset or business.<ref>Canadian rules cited above specify more than 30 classes for which specific percentages are allowed.</ref>  Some systems allow specific charges for cost recovery for some assets upon certain identifiable events.<ref>For example, Germany allows a deduction for \u201cdepreciation\u201d for assets that have come to be worth significantly less than their unrecovered cost due to identifiable events.  English language {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.</ref>\n\nCapitalization may be required for some items without the potential for cost recovery until disposition or abandonment of the asset to which the capitalized costs relate.  This is often the case for costs related to the formation or reorganization of a corporation, or certain expenses in corporate acquisitions.<ref>See [[INDOPCO]] v. Commissioner.</ref>  However, some systems provide for amortization of certain such costs, at the election of the taxpayer.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/248- 26 USC 248] for corporations, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/709- 26 USC 709] for partnerships.</ref>\n\n==Non-business expenses==\nSome systems distinguish between an active trade or business and the holding of assets to produce income.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/212- 26 USC 212]; UK [ ICTA ].</ref>  In such systems, there may be additional limitations on the timing and nature of amounts that may be claimed as tax deductions.  Many of the rules, including accounting methods and limits on deductions, that apply to business expenses also apply to income producing expenses.\n\n===Losses===\n{{See also|Loss on sale of residential property}}\nMany systems allow a deduction for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets.  This deduction may be limited to gains from the same class of assets.  In the U.S., a loss on non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains.  Also, in the U.S. a loss on the sale of the taxpayer's principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.\n\n===Personal deductions===\nMany jurisdictions allow certain classes of taxpayers to reduce taxable income for certain inherently personal items.  A common such deduction is a fixed allowance for the taxpayer and certain family members or other persons supported by the taxpayer.  The U.S. allows such a deduction for \u201cpersonal exemptions\u201d for the taxpayer and certain members of the taxpayer's household.<ref>26 USC 151, 152.  The amount is adjusted annually for inflation, and was [https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=177992,00.html $3,650] for 2009.</ref>  The UK grants a \u201c[[personal allowance]].\u201d<ref>For 2009, the amount was [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm \u00a36,475], with additional allowances for married couples over age 75.</ref>  Both U.S. and UK allowances are phased out for individuals or married couples with income in excess of specified levels.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions allow reduction of taxable income for certain categories of expenses not incurred in connection with a business or investments.  In the U.S. system, these (as well as certain business or investment expenses) are referred to as \u201c[[itemized deductions]]\u201d for individuals.  The UK allows a few of these as personal reliefs.  These include, for example, the following for U.S. residents (and UK residents as noted):\n*Medical expenses (in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income)<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/213- 26 USC 213].</ref>\n*State and local income and property taxes<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/164- 26 USC 164(a)(2)].  Individuals may elect for a tax year after 2003 to claim a deduction for state and local sales taxes in lieu of the deduction for state and local income taxes.</ref>\n*Interest expense on certain home loans<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163- 26 USC 163] subsection (h) of which limits the deduction of personal interest.</ref>\n*Gifts of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations, subject to certain maximum limitations,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170]  Qualifying organizations generally include organizations that are [[tax exempt]] under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/503- 26 USC 503(c)]([[charitable organizations]]) or (d) ([[religious orders]]), as well as certain other organizations.  Generally, the deduction is limited to 50% of gross income.  This limitation is reduced in certain circumstances.  Amounts in excess of the limitation may be deducted in future years, also subject to limitations.</ref>\n*Losses on non-income-producing property due to casualty or theft,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/165- 26 USC 165].</ref>\n*Contribution to certain retirement or health savings plans (U.S. and UK),<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/219- 26 USC 219], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201c401(k)\u201d and \u201cIRA\u201d plans, among others, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223- 26 USC 223], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201chealth savings accounts\u201d that are used to pay for medical expenses.</ref>\n*Certain educational expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/221- 26 USC 221] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/222- 222].</ref>\n\nMany systems provide that an individual may claim a tax deduction for personal payments that, upon payment, become taxable to another person, such as alimony.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/215- 26 USC 215].</ref>  Such systems generally require, at a minimum, reporting of such amounts,<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf Form IRS Form 1040], line 31b.</ref> and may require that [[withholding tax]] be applied to the payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p504/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000175944|title=Publication 504 (2017), Divorced or Separated Individuals - Internal Revenue Service|author=|date=|website=www.irs.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Groups of taxpayers==\nSome systems allow a deduction to a company or other entity for expenses or losses of another company or entity if the two companies or entities are commonly controlled.  Such deduction may be referred to as \u201cgroup relief.\u201d<ref>UK [S380 ICTA et seq ]</ref>  Generally, such deductions function in lieu of consolidated or combined computation of tax ([[tax consolidation]]) for such groups.  Group relief may be available for companies in [[Member state of the European Union|EU member countries]] with respect to losses of group companies in other countries.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ctsa/ext_group_relief.pdf UK draft guidance] following the [[Marks & Spencer]] case.</ref>\n\n==International aspects==\nMany systems impose limitations on tax deductions paid to foreign parties, especially related parties.
