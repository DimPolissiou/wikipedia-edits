When he returns home with the [[kayak]] paddle Ricky accidentally left behind, he meets a woman ([[Marilyn Monroe]]), who is a commercial actress and former model who rents the apartment upstairs while in town to make television spots for a brand of toothpaste. That evening, he works on reading the manuscript of a book in which [[psychiatrist]] Dr. Brubaker ([[Oskar Homolka]]) claims that almost all men are driven to have [[Affair|extra-marital affairs]] in the seventh year of marriage. Sherman has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to convince her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, including his secretary, a nurse, and Helen's bridesmaid, but she laughs it off. A tomato plant then crashes into his lounge chair; the woman upstairs apologizes for accidentally knocking it off the balcony, and Richard invites her down for a drink.\n\n[[File:Ewell leans in for kiss in The Seven Year Itch trailer 1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Tom Ewell reprised his Broadway role with Monroe replacing [[Vanessa Brown]].]]\nHe waits for her to get dressed, including in underwear she says she keeps cool in her icebox. When she arrives, a vision in pink, they have a drink and he lies about being married. When she sees his wedding ring, he backtracks but she is unconcerned, having no designs on him, only on his air-conditioning. He has a fantasy that she is a [[femme fatale]] overcome by his playing of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Piano Concerto]]. In reality, she prefers [[Chopsticks (music)|Chopsticks]], which they play together. Richard, overcome by his fantasies, awkwardly grabs at her, causing them to fall off the piano bench. He apologizes for his indiscretion but she says it happens to her all the time. Guilt-ridden, however, he asks her to leave.\n\nOver the next few days, they spend more time together and Richard imagines that they are growing closer, although she is immune to his imagined charms. Helen continually calls her husband, asking him to send the paddle so Ricky can use the kayak, but Richard is repeatedly distracted. His waning resolve to resist temptation fuels his fear that he is succumbing to the \"Seven Year Itch\". He seeks help from Dr. Brubaker, but to no avail. His imagination then runs even wilder: the young woman tells a visiting [[plumber]] ([[Victor Moore]]) how Richard is \"just like the ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''\"; the plumber repeats her story to neighbor McKenzie, whom Helen had asked to drop by to pick up Ricky's paddle. Richard imagines his wife with McKenzie on a hayride which actually takes place but into which he injects his paranoia, guilt and jealousy. After seeing ''The Creature from the Black Lagoon'', the young woman stands over the subway grate to experience the breeze&nbsp;\u2013 Monroe in the iconic scene in the [[pleat]]ed white [[halterneck]] dress, blowing her skirt in the wind.\n\nEventually coming to his senses, and fearing his wife's retribution (which he imagines in a fantasy scene) Richard, paddle in hand, tells the young woman she can stay in his apartment \u2013 he then runs off to catch the next train to Maine to be with Helen and Ricky.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe photo pose Seven Year Itch.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Monroe is posing for photographers, wearing a white halterneck dress, which hem is blown up by air from a subway grate on which she is standing.|Monroe posing for photographers while filming the subway grate scene for ''The Seven Year Itch'' in September 1954]]\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as The Girl (credited as such, though Richard Sherman satirically remarks \"maybe she's Marilyn Monroe\")\n* [[Tom Ewell]] as Richard Sherman (billed as Tommy Ewell)\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Helen Sherman\n* [[Sonny Tufts]] as Tom MacKenzie\n* [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] as Kruhulik\n* [[Oscar Homolka]] as Dr. Brubaker\n* [[Marguerite Chapman]] as Miss Morris\n* [[Victor Moore]] as Plumber\n* [[Donald MacBride]] as Mr. Brady\n* [[Roxanne (model)|Roxanne]] as Elaine\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Nurse Finch\n* [[Tom Nolan]] as Ricky Sherman (uncredited)\n* [[Doro Merande]] as Waitress at Vegetarian Restaurant (uncredited)\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Woman at Vegetarian Restaurant (uncredited)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:090px;\"|Song<ref name=\"songs\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048605/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd|title=The Seven Year Itch (1955): Soundtracks|publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}</ref>\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:120px;\"|Performer(s)\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:160px;\"|Note(s)\n|-\n|\"[[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]]\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Gary Graffman]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], & the [[New York Philharmonic|NYPO]]<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Rachmaninov-Goes-Movies-Sergey/dp/B0000029WH</ref>\n|Played on a record and often in the score\n|-\n|\"[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n|Played often in the score\n|-\n|\"[[Chopsticks (music)|Chopsticks]]\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Tom Ewell]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n|-\n|}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Monroe's skirt blows up in The Seven Year Itch trailer 1.jpg|thumb|right|Marilyn Monroe's skirt blows upwards in the film.]]\n[[File:What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City.png|thumb|right|The depiction of Monroe over the grate has been compared to a similar event in the 1901 short film ''[[What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City]]''.<ref>Rosemary Hanes with Brian Taves. \"[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/ Moving Image Section&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division]\" [[The Library of Congress]].

Many lines and scenes from the play were cut or re-written because they were deemed indecent by the [[Hays Code|Hays office]]. Axelrod and Wilder complained that the film was being made under [[straitjacket]]ed conditions. This led to a major plot change: in the play, Sherman and The Girl had sex; in the movie, the romance is all in his head. (At least for the most part. Romance between the two is still suggested. Sherman and the Girl kiss twice, once outside the movie theater, the other time before Sherman goes to take Ricky's paddle to Ricky.)\n\nThe footage of Monroe's dress billowing over a subway grate was shot twice: the first take was shot on location outside the Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater, then located at 586 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, while the second take was on a sound stage. Both eventually made their way into the finished film,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} despite the often-held belief that the original on-location footage's sound had been rendered useless by the overexcited crowd present during filming in New York.\n\nThe exterior shooting location of Richard's apartment was 164 East 61st Street in Manhattan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121218091324/http://thecad.net/Theatre/george-axelrod.html The Cad]</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe original 1955 review by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was largely positive.

Both eventually made their way into the finished film,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} despite the often-held belief that the original on-location footage's sound had been rendered useless by the overexcited crowd present during filming in New York.\n\nThe exterior shooting location of Richard's apartment was 164 East 61st Street in Manhattan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121218091324/http://thecad.net/Theatre/george-axelrod.html The Cad]</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe original 1955 review by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was largely positive.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

The Type 4S is based on the [[Lamborghini Huracan]] and shares its platform and engine. The Type 4S was introduced at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]] and its production began in late 2015.\n\n== Development == \nDevelopment of the Type 4S began in 2013 and prototypes began testing in early-2014. The Type 4S is based on the Modular Sports System platform shared with the [[Lamborghini Huracan]]. The V10 engine used in the Hurac\u00e0n was detuned for the base model while the power output of the engine remained the same as the Hurac\u00e0n for the V10 plus model. Rumours for the V8 engine for the R8 were in circulation but those were proven wrong as the company stated that the V8 engine would be discontinued mainly because of emissions regulations. The Type 4S was introduced at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]]. The all-electric version called the e-Tron which was in development phase in the production life span of the Type 42 was also introduced at the same occasion and was now based on the Type 4S.<ref name=\"c&d\"/><ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.motortrend.com/news/watch-a-next-gen-audi-r8-prototype-lap-the-nurburgring-w-video/|title=Watch A Next-Gen Audi R8 Prototype Lap The Nurb\u00fcrgring (W/Video)|date=2014-03-27|first=Christian|last=Seabaugh|access-date=2019-03-29|publisher=[[Motor Trend]]}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Road models ==\n===R8 Coup\u00e9===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal \n| width = 200\n|image1= 2018 Audi R8 Coupe V10 plus Front.jpg\n|image2= 2018 Audi R8 Coupe V10 plus Rear.jpg\n|caption2= Audi R8 V10 plus coup\u00e9\n|image3=Audi R8 V10 plus Innenraum.JPG\n|caption3= Interior\n}}\n\nThe new R8 has two production variants, the base 5.2 FSI model with a {{convert|540|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} V10 engine and the more powerful V10 Plus with a {{convert|610|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine. The body is lighter and stiffer, due to substitution of several large aluminium parts in the shell by carbon fibre. Extra electronics are incorporated in the chassis as compared to the first generation to improve handling. The \u2018Virtual Cockpit\u2019 first introduced in the [[Audi TT|TT]] was also made available. The all-wheel drive system and the 7-speed S-tronic transmission are standard with no manual transmission available. The quattro all-wheel-drive system used on the R8 is slightly rear-biased with power delivery to the wheels variable. A water-cooled front differential and a passive limited-slip rear differential along with an electromechanical power steering contribute to the agile handling of the car. The variable magnetic-ride suspension is available as an option but is exclusive to the European markets.\n\nThe design reflects Audi's current design language implemented on all of its models. The distinctive \"side-blades\" present behind the doors on the Type 42 have now been split into two and are now present on the rear side windows and below the belt line. The side blades can be optioned in body colour. Audi's trademark LED head lamps were standard on the car and the newly developed laser headlamps are available as an option in Europe only. \n\nThe R8 is available with 19-inch wheels as standard with 20-inch wheels available as an option.

Engine power increased by {{cvt|30|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the base model while the V10 Plus was renamed V10 Performance quattro and the engine saw a power increase by {{cvt|9|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Other mechanical changes include the choice of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres, larger carbon ceramic brakes and a new steering rack system for a more direct response. A carbon fibre roll bar is also optional which decreases the weight by 2&nbsp;kg.\n\nExterior changes included more angular and aggressive styling. The new front bumper of the car has a squared design and winglets on both sides to improve front downforce. The grille was enlarged and now stretched between the headlights. Above the grille, three small horizontal air intakes are present between the headlights for improved airflow harking back to the famous [[Audi Quattro]]. Side skirts finished in exposed carbon fibre now flank the sides of the car and at the rear, a single wide grille is now present beneath the taillights joined by an aggressive diffuser and two round dual exhaust tips in exposed and sculptured cut-outs.\n\nThe interior was carried over from the outgoing model with new trim options available.\n\nPerformance figures include a {{cvt|0-97|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 3.5 seconds for the base model and 3.1 seconds for the V10 Performance quattro model.

Despite looking identical to a regular R8, the LMS shares very little with its road-going counterpart in terms of features and mechanics. A new race specification V10 engine develops a peak power output of {{cvt|430|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}. The removal of the standard all-wheel drive system and the intelligent mix of materials such as aluminum in the Audi Space Frame (ASF), a structural CFRP component and the steel roll cage alone make the chassis about {{cvt|30|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter - now weighing {{cvt|252|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. At the same time, the torsional stiffness of the stressed frame has increased by 39 percent. These weight saving measures result in a weight of just \n{{cvt|1225|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Aside from that, the car packs many safety features such as a modified spaceframe structure at the front and a carbon fibre crash element at the rear protect the driver in a crash, the special PS1 racing seat from the Audi R18 e-Tron quattro which has been known to set the safety standards for LMP1 cars is used for additional safety and is connected directly to the chassis for increased stiffness. A quickly adjustable foot lever system and a height and length adjustable safety steering column allow versatile adjustment to various drivers. A rescue opening in the roof as used in DTM race touring cars is implemented in the R8 LMS GT3, a first for any GT3 car, after an accident, it allows the driver's helmet to be lifted in a way that avoids straining the spinal column.\n[[File:Audi R8 LMS GT3, Paris Motor Show 2018, Paris (1Y7A1172).jpg|thumb|left|R8 LMS Evo at the Paris Motor Show 2018 ]]\n\nAlthough the combination of the materials in the R8 LMS is more complex, Audi has managed to integrate the manufacturing process for production and race cars even more closely than before. In a new manufacturing facility at the Bollinger Hofe industrial park in Heilbronn, quattro GmbH produces both variants in combination. Although the race car, for example, is fitted with aluminum cast joints and a steel roll cage the racing chassis of the R8 LMS remains integrated in the basic production process up to and including the stages of roof assembly and cathodic dip painting (CDP), which is a form of priming. Following these production steps, the race cars are completed in Heilbronn-Biberach. The new aerodynamic concept of the Audi R8 LMS for the first time includes a fully lined underfloor and a conceptually integrated rear diffuser. As a result, the dimensions of the rear wing can be reduced without a corresponding increase of aerodynamic drag. The wheel arches, which are open rearwards via a larger cross-section, contribute to improved airflow. The airflow rate and cooling area of the radiator at the front have increased by ten percent to handle maximum outside air temperatures. In order to improve the race drivers' ability to concentrate on their tasks, fresh air circulation in the cockpit has been improved. At a speed of 200&nbsp;km/h, the airflow rate is 250 litres per second. Audi has achieved these improvements despite the significantly higher constraints imposed on aerodynamics design by the 2016 regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/txt/6172/2/Audi-R8-LMS.html|title=2015 Audi R8 LMS|date=6 March 2015|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}} \n\n===R8 LMS GT4 ===\n[[File:Racing One Audi R8 LMS GT4.jpg|thumb|Team Racing One's Audi R8 LMS GT4]]\nAudi Sport introduced a version of the R8 for GT4-class racing at the 2017 New York International Auto Show held in April.

generation of the [[Audi R8|R8]] sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Audi. The Type 4S is based on the [[Lamborghini Huracan]] and shares its platform and engine. The Type 4S was introduced at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]] and its production began in late 2015.\n\n== Development == \nDevelopment of the Type 4S began in 2013 and prototypes began testing in early-2014. The Type 4S is based on the Modular Sports System platform shared with the [[Lamborghini Huracan]]. The V10 engine used in the Hurac\u00e0n was detuned for the base model while the power output of the engine remained the same as the Hurac\u00e0n for the V10 plus model. Rumours for the V8 engine for the R8 were in circulation but those were proven wrong as the company stated that the V8 engine would be discontinued mainly because of emissions regulations. The Type 4S was introduced at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]]. The all-electric version called the e-Tron which was in development phase in the production life span of the Type 42 was also introduced at the same occasion and was now based on the Type 4S.<ref name=\"c&d\"/><ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.motortrend.com/news/watch-a-next-gen-audi-r8-prototype-lap-the-nurburgring-w-video/|title=Watch A Next-Gen Audi R8 Prototype Lap The Nurb\u00fcrgring (W/Video)|date=2014-03-27|first=Christian|last=Seabaugh|access-date=2019-03-29|publisher=[[Motor Trend]]}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Road models ==\n===R8 Coup\u00e9===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal \n| width = 200\n|image1= 2018 Audi R8 Coupe V10 plus Front.jpg\n|image2= 2018 Audi R8 Coupe V10 plus Rear.jpg\n|caption2= Audi R8 V10 plus coup\u00e9\n|image3=Audi R8 V10 plus Innenraum.JPG\n|caption3= Interior\n}}\n\nThe new R8 has two production variants, the base 5.2 FSI model with a {{convert|540|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} V10 engine and the more powerful V10 Plus with a {{convert|610|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine. The body is lighter and stiffer, due to substitution of several large aluminium parts in the shell by carbon fibre. Extra electronics are incorporated in the chassis as compared to the first generation to improve handling. The \u2018Virtual Cockpit\u2019 first introduced in the [[Audi TT|TT]] was also made available. The all-wheel drive system and the 7-speed S-tronic transmission are standard with no manual transmission available. The quattro all-wheel-drive system used on the R8 is slightly rear-biased with power delivery to the wheels variable. A water-cooled front differential and a passive limited-slip rear differential along with an electromechanical power steering contribute to the agile handling of the car. The variable magnetic-ride suspension is available as an option but is exclusive to the European markets.\n\nThe design reflects Audi's current design language implemented on all of its models. The distinctive \"side-blades\" present behind the doors on the Type 42 have now been split into two and are now present on the rear side windows and below the belt line. The side blades can be optioned in body colour. Audi's trademark LED head lamps were standard on the car and the newly developed laser headlamps are available as an option in Europe only. \n\nThe R8 is available with 19-inch wheels as standard with 20-inch wheels available as an option. Carbon-ceramic brakes are also optional equipment.<ref name=\"c&d\"/>\n\n===R8 Spyder===\n[[File:Audi R8 Spyder - Mondial de l'Automobile de Paris 2016 - 004.jpg|alt=Audi R8 V10 Spyder|thumb|right|Audi R8 Spyder]]\nPresented at the [[New York International Auto Show#2016|2016 New York International Auto Show]], the R8 Spyder is the convertible variant of the new R8. Initially, it was only available with the standard V10 engine, which has a power output of {{convert|540|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, although a V10 Plus Spyder with the engine having a power output of {{convert|610|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was added to the range in mid-2017.

It utilises the same {{Convert|540|PS|hp kW|0|abbr=on}} V10 engine of the standard R8 coupe. Because of the deletion of the all-wheel drive system, weight is reduced by {{cvt|110|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Visually, the R8 RWS is signified by a matte-black grille, matte-black front and rear airflow openings, and a gloss-black upper side blade. A red vinyl trim stripe that stretches from the front left to the right rear is optional. Sport seats are standard, as are black 19-inch wheels wrapped in 35-series tyres.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2018-audi-r8-v10-rws-official-photos-and-info-news|title=2018 Audi R8 V10 RWS Official Photos and Info {{!}} News {{!}} Car and Driver|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Facelift ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal \n| width = 200\n| image1= Audi R8 Spyder IAA 2019 JM 0581.jpg\n| image2= Audi R8 Spyder IAA 2019 JM 1146.jpg\n| footer= Audi R8 Spyder V10 performance quattro (post facelift)\n}}\nThe R8 received a mid-cycle facelift in October 2018. Engine power increased by {{cvt|30|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the base model while the V10 Plus was renamed V10 Performance quattro and the engine saw a power increase by {{cvt|9|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Other mechanical changes include the choice of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres, larger carbon ceramic brakes and a new steering rack system for a more direct response. A carbon fibre roll bar is also optional which decreases the weight by 2&nbsp;kg.\n\nExterior changes included more angular and aggressive styling. The new front bumper of the car has a squared design and winglets on both sides to improve front downforce. The grille was enlarged and now stretched between the headlights. Above the grille, three small horizontal air intakes are present between the headlights for improved airflow harking back to the famous [[Audi Quattro]]. Side skirts finished in exposed carbon fibre now flank the sides of the car and at the rear, a single wide grille is now present beneath the taillights joined by an aggressive diffuser and two round dual exhaust tips in exposed and sculptured cut-outs.\n\nThe interior was carried over from the outgoing model with new trim options available.\n\nPerformance figures include a {{cvt|0-97|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 3.5 seconds for the base model and 3.1 seconds for the V10 Performance quattro model. Top speed for the V10 Performance quattro is {{cvt|205|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The facelift model went on sale in Europe in early 2019.<ref>{{cite news|URL=https://www.motor1.com/news/273325/2019-audi-r8-see-changes/|title=2019 Audi R8: See The Changes Side-By-Side|date=2018-10-24|first=Christopher|last=Smith|publisher=Motor1|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/audi/r8/105264/new-audi-r8-2019-review|title=New Audi R8 2019 review|date=2018-11-18|first=James|last=Batchelor|publisher=Autoweek|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Special models ==\n=== R8 e-Tron ===\n[[File:2015-03-03 Geneva Motor Show 4120.JPG|thumb|Audi R8 [[Audi e-tron (brand)|e-tron]] ]]\nThe production version of the Audi R8 e-tron was introduced at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]]<ref>{{cite news|title=2016 Audi R8 e-tron: The Electrified R8 Finally Arrives|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-audi-r8-e-tron-photos-and-info-news|accessdate=7 March 2015|publisher=Car and Driver}}</ref> The limited production electric sports car was available only in Europe.

Despite looking identical to a regular R8, the LMS shares very little with its road-going counterpart in terms of features and mechanics. A new race specification V10 engine develops a peak power output of {{cvt|430|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}. The removal of the standard all-wheel drive system and the intelligent mix of materials such as aluminum in the Audi Space Frame (ASF), a structural CFRP component and the steel roll cage alone make the chassis about {{cvt|30|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter - now weighing {{cvt|252|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. At the same time, the torsional stiffness of the stressed frame has increased by 39 percent. These weight saving measures result in a weight of just \n{{cvt|1225|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Aside from that, the car packs many safety features such as a modified spaceframe structure at the front and a carbon fibre crash element at the rear protect the driver in a crash, the special PS1 racing seat from the Audi R18 e-Tron quattro which has been known to set the safety standards for LMP1 cars is used for additional safety and is connected directly to the chassis for increased stiffness. A quickly adjustable foot lever system and a height and length adjustable safety steering column allow versatile adjustment to various drivers. A rescue opening in the roof as used in DTM race touring cars is implemented in the R8 LMS GT3, a first for any GT3 car, after an accident, it allows the driver's helmet to be lifted in a way that avoids straining the spinal column.\n[[File:Audi R8 LMS GT3, Paris Motor Show 2018, Paris (1Y7A1172).jpg|thumb|left|R8 LMS Evo at the Paris Motor Show 2018 ]]\n\nAlthough the combination of the materials in the R8 LMS is more complex, Audi has managed to integrate the manufacturing process for production and race cars even more closely than before. In a new manufacturing facility at the Bollinger Hofe industrial park in Heilbronn, quattro GmbH produces both variants in combination. Although the race car, for example, is fitted with aluminum cast joints and a steel roll cage the racing chassis of the R8 LMS remains integrated in the basic production process up to and including the stages of roof assembly and cathodic dip painting (CDP), which is a form of priming. Following these production steps, the race cars are completed in Heilbronn-Biberach. The new aerodynamic concept of the Audi R8 LMS for the first time includes a fully lined underfloor and a conceptually integrated rear diffuser. As a result, the dimensions of the rear wing can be reduced without a corresponding increase of aerodynamic drag. The wheel arches, which are open rearwards via a larger cross-section, contribute to improved airflow. The airflow rate and cooling area of the radiator at the front have increased by ten percent to handle maximum outside air temperatures. In order to improve the race drivers' ability to concentrate on their tasks, fresh air circulation in the cockpit has been improved. At a speed of 200&nbsp;km/h, the airflow rate is 250 litres per second. Audi has achieved these improvements despite the significantly higher constraints imposed on aerodynamics design by the 2016 regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/txt/6172/2/Audi-R8-LMS.html|title=2015 Audi R8 LMS|date=6 March 2015|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}} \n\n===R8 LMS GT4 ===\n[[File:Racing One Audi R8 LMS GT4.jpg|thumb|Team Racing One's Audi R8 LMS GT4]]\nAudi Sport introduced a version of the R8 for GT4-class racing at the 2017 New York International Auto Show held in April.

Despite the use of the word \"World\" in its name, the general look and theme of World Bazaar is that of early 20th-century America, matching the \"Main Street, U.S.A.\" areas of other Magic Kingdom-style parks. World Bazaar consists of two intersecting \"streets\": Main Street (the primary corridor running from the main entrance toward [[Cinderella Castle]]), and Center Street, which forms a perpendicular line with Main Street and leads to Adventureland in one direction and Tomorrowland in the other. World Bazaar has a permanent canopy covering the Main Street and Center Street areas, designed to protect guests from the elements.\n\n===Adventureland===\n[[File:Western River Railroad Missouri a.jpg|thumb|[[Western River Railroad]]]]\n{{Main|Adventureland (Disney)#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Adventureland (Disney)}}\nAdventureland consists of two distinct yet complementary areas: A New Orleans-themed area and a \"jungle\"-themed area. It is roughly a combination of the [[New Orleans Square]] and Adventureland areas found in [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] in the United States.\n\n===Westernland===\n{{Main|Frontierland#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Frontierland}}\nWesternland is an \"old west\" themed area, the counterpart of [[Frontierland]] in other Magic Kingdom-style parks. Like its counterparts, the landscape of Westernland is dominated by the [[Rivers of America (Disney)|Rivers of America]], a man-made waterway that is home to the [[Mark Twain Riverboat]], [[Tom Sawyer Island]] and numerous live and [[Audio-Animatronic]] animals.\n\n===Critter Country===\n{{Main|Critter Country#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Critter Country}}\nCritter Country is a small area of the park and is dominated by a single major attraction, [[Splash Mountain]].\n\n===Fantasyland===\n{{Main|Fantasyland#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Fantasyland}}\nLike other Magic Kingdom theme parks, Fantasyland's central entryway is a castle, in this case [[Cinderella Castle]], a near exact copy of the one in Florida's Magic Kingdom. Lacking any \"thrill rides,\" Fantasyland's attractions are generally [[dark rides]] that take visitors through scenes from Disney films such as [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]], and [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]].\n\n===Toontown===\n[[Image:Tokyo Disneyland Toontown view 201306.jpg|thumb|Toontown]]\n{{Main|Mickey's Toontown#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Mickey's Toontown}}\nLike its counterparts in other Disney theme parks, Toontown (called \"Mickey's Toontown\" at other Disney parks) is heavily inspired by the movie [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]. Appropriately, the major attraction here is [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]].\n\n===Tomorrowland===\n{{Main|Tomorrowland#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Tomorrowland}}\nAs is the case with other modern-day Disney theme parks, Tokyo Disneyland's [[Tomorrowland]] forgoes a realism-based vision of the future and instead features science-fiction fantasy themes. Architecturally it borrows much from the 1971\u20131993 version of Florida's Tomorrowland. Rides include [[Space Mountain (Tokyo Disneyland)|Space Mountain]], [[Star Tours\u2013The Adventures Continue]] and [[Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Attendance==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!2012 || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || Worldwide rank\n|-\n|  14,847,000<ref name=\"2012 Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf |publisher=Themed Entertainment Association |accessdate=July 25, 2013 |year=2012 |title=TEA/AECOM 2012 Global Attractions Report |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408022049/http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}</ref> || 17,214,000<ref name=\"2013 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2013 Global Attractions Report |url=http://www.teaconnect.org/pdf/TEAAECOM2013.pdf |publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]] |accessdate=2014-06-06 |year=2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606220440/http://www.teaconnect.org/pdf/TEAAECOM2013.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-06 }}</ref> || 17,300,000<ref name=\"2014 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2014 Global Attractions Attendance Report|url=http://www.aecom.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2014_Theme_Index.pdf|year=2015|page=7|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association/AECOM|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref> || 16,600,000<ref name=\"2015 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2015 Global Attractions Attendance Report Report|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=June 3, 2016|year=2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618050155/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf|archivedate=June 18, 2016}}</ref> || 16,540,000<ref name=\"2016 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2016 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=June 6, 2017|year=2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201150/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf|archivedate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> || 16,600,000<ref name=\"2017 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2017 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=May 17, 2018|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201150/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|archivedate=May 17, 2018}}</ref>  || 17,907,000<ref name=\"2018 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2018 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/328_669153_190522.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=May 23, 2019|year=2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201150/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|archivedate=May 23, 2019}}</ref> || 3\n|}{{Clr}}\n\n==Future==\nSince the park opened in 1983, Tokyo Disney Resort has regularly been one of the most profitable Disney Resorts.

Once dominated by [[Disney Legends]], Masatomo Takahashi, the former president of The Oriental Land Company, states this growth and development as one of its primary goals: \"We must not just repeat what we receive from Disney.

Japanese engineers and architects visited California to tour Disneyland and prepare to construct the new park.<ref name=\"Oriental Land Co Ltd 1980\"/> The construction of the park began a year later and was covered by hundreds of reporters as an indication of the high expectations for the park in the future. The final cost of Tokyo Disneyland was 180 billion yen rather than the projected 100 billion yen.<ref name=\"Oriental Land Co Ltd 1980\"/>\n\nOn 28 February 2020, Disney announced a temporary closure of Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea from February 29 to March 15 to combat the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/tokyo-disneyland-to-close-through-mid-march-on-coronavirus-concerns.html|title=Tokyo Disneyland to close through mid-March on coronavirus concerns|date=2020-02-28|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> Since then, they have extended the closure to April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/03/11/coronavirus-tokyo-disneyland-universal-studios-japan-extend-closures/5019269002/|title=Tokyo Disneyland, Universal Studios Japan extend park closures over coronavirus|last=Yasharoff|first=Hannah|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> \n\n==Themed areas==\n{{Main|List of Tokyo Disneyland attractions}}\n\nWith a few exceptions, Tokyo Disneyland features the same attractions found in [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] and [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]].<ref name=\"post-gazette.com\"/>\n\n===World Bazaar===\n[[Image:StitchEntranceTokyoDisneyland.jpg|thumb|A floral arrangement depicts [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] as part of a celebration.]]\n{{Main|Main Street, U.S.A.#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Main Street, U.S.A.}}\nWorld Bazaar is the main entry corridor and primary shopping area of Tokyo Disneyland. Despite the use of the word \"World\" in its name, the general look and theme of World Bazaar is that of early 20th-century America, matching the \"Main Street, U.S.A.\" areas of other Magic Kingdom-style parks. World Bazaar consists of two intersecting \"streets\": Main Street (the primary corridor running from the main entrance toward [[Cinderella Castle]]), and Center Street, which forms a perpendicular line with Main Street and leads to Adventureland in one direction and Tomorrowland in the other. World Bazaar has a permanent canopy covering the Main Street and Center Street areas, designed to protect guests from the elements.\n\n===Adventureland===\n[[File:Western River Railroad Missouri a.jpg|thumb|[[Western River Railroad]]]]\n{{Main|Adventureland (Disney)#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Adventureland (Disney)}}\nAdventureland consists of two distinct yet complementary areas: A New Orleans-themed area and a \"jungle\"-themed area. It is roughly a combination of the [[New Orleans Square]] and Adventureland areas found in [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] in the United States.\n\n===Westernland===\n{{Main|Frontierland#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Frontierland}}\nWesternland is an \"old west\" themed area, the counterpart of [[Frontierland]] in other Magic Kingdom-style parks. Like its counterparts, the landscape of Westernland is dominated by the [[Rivers of America (Disney)|Rivers of America]], a man-made waterway that is home to the [[Mark Twain Riverboat]], [[Tom Sawyer Island]] and numerous live and [[Audio-Animatronic]] animals.\n\n===Critter Country===\n{{Main|Critter Country#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Critter Country}}\nCritter Country is a small area of the park and is dominated by a single major attraction, [[Splash Mountain]].\n\n===Fantasyland===\n{{Main|Fantasyland#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Fantasyland}}\nLike other Magic Kingdom theme parks, Fantasyland's central entryway is a castle, in this case [[Cinderella Castle]], a near exact copy of the one in Florida's Magic Kingdom. Lacking any \"thrill rides,\" Fantasyland's attractions are generally [[dark rides]] that take visitors through scenes from Disney films such as [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]], and [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]].\n\n===Toontown===\n[[Image:Tokyo Disneyland Toontown view 201306.jpg|thumb|Toontown]]\n{{Main|Mickey's Toontown#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Mickey's Toontown}}\nLike its counterparts in other Disney theme parks, Toontown (called \"Mickey's Toontown\" at other Disney parks) is heavily inspired by the movie [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]. Appropriately, the major attraction here is [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]].\n\n===Tomorrowland===\n{{Main|Tomorrowland#Tokyo Disneyland|l1=Tomorrowland}}\nAs is the case with other modern-day Disney theme parks, Tokyo Disneyland's [[Tomorrowland]] forgoes a realism-based vision of the future and instead features science-fiction fantasy themes. Architecturally it borrows much from the 1971\u20131993 version of Florida's Tomorrowland. Rides include [[Space Mountain (Tokyo Disneyland)|Space Mountain]], [[Star Tours\u2013The Adventures Continue]] and [[Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Attendance==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!2012 || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || Worldwide rank\n|-\n|  14,847,000<ref name=\"2012 Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf |publisher=Themed Entertainment Association |accessdate=July 25, 2013 |year=2012 |title=TEA/AECOM 2012 Global Attractions Report |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408022049/http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}</ref> || 17,214,000<ref name=\"2013 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2013 Global Attractions Report |url=http://www.teaconnect.org/pdf/TEAAECOM2013.pdf |publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]] |accessdate=2014-06-06 |year=2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606220440/http://www.teaconnect.org/pdf/TEAAECOM2013.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-06 }}</ref> || 17,300,000<ref name=\"2014 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2014 Global Attractions Attendance Report|url=http://www.aecom.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2014_Theme_Index.pdf|year=2015|page=7|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association/AECOM|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref> || 16,600,000<ref name=\"2015 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2015 Global Attractions Attendance Report Report|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=June 3, 2016|year=2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618050155/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf|archivedate=June 18, 2016}}</ref> || 16,540,000<ref name=\"2016 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2016 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=June 6, 2017|year=2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201150/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf|archivedate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> || 16,600,000<ref name=\"2017 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2017 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=May 17, 2018|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201150/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|archivedate=May 17, 2018}}</ref>  || 17,907,000<ref name=\"2018 attendance\">{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2018 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/328_669153_190522.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=May 23, 2019|year=2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201150/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|archivedate=May 23, 2019}}</ref> || 3\n|}{{Clr}}\n\n==Future==\nSince the park opened in 1983, Tokyo Disney Resort has regularly been one of the most profitable Disney Resorts.

Once dominated by [[Disney Legends]], Masatomo Takahashi, the former president of The Oriental Land Company, states this growth and development as one of its primary goals: \"We must not just repeat what we receive from Disney.

Built into the architecture of the port is [[Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta]]; the hotel serves as a full-scale reproduction of the various buildings of Portofino and Venice's ports, and serves as the southern berm (or border) of the park. The design choice of combining a real hotel within the themed park areas helps to further the illusion that (as either a park or hotel guest) you are in an actual city; since the hotel is a functional building (rather than a 'set facade' -- the general standard in theme park designs) the  effect of onlooking hotel guests, that may observe the park from hotel's rooms, balconies, and terraces serve in adding a level of kinetic authenticity in passing for an authentic Italian villa for park visitors, while the hotel guest enjoys the harborside views and novelty of location.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tokyo Disneyland Hotel MiraCosta|url=http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g298162-d617276-Reviews-Tokyo_DisneySea_Hotel_MiraCosta-Urayasu_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html|publisher=TripAdvisor.com|accessdate=14 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tiemann|first=Amy|title=DisneySea blends Disney imagination and Japanese style|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13507_3-9793054-18.html|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=cnet News|date=8 October 2007}}</ref> Mediterranean Harbor also features [[Soarin'|Soaring: Fantastic Flight]], a flying simulator, and \"[[Fortress Explorations]]\", a large-scale interactive play area for guests that features exploration-themed activities and attractions. \n\n===Mysterious Island===\nMysterious Island is a \"port-of-call\" within Mount Prometheus, the giant volcano that is the park's centerpiece and most prominent feature. It relies heavily on the storytelling of [[Jules Verne]] and, specifically, the mythology of the volcano fortress mentioned several times in the books called \"Vulcania\". The Mount Prometheus ride employs technology similar to [[Epcot]]'s [[Test Track]].<ref name=\"Owen\"/> The smallest \"port of call\", it nevertheless holds two of the more popular attractions: \"[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (attraction)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]\", a thrill ride, and \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", a [[dark ride]]. Despite its name, Mysterious Island is not an island; it is built into the side of Mount Prometheus, which is part of the show building for the two attractions. The architecture in this port is of Victorian style.\n\nAttractions include [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (attraction)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]], and the [[dark ride]] [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Tokyo DisneySea)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]].\n\n===Mermaid Lagoon===\nMermaid Lagoon is home to the characters of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. The facade is made to resemble King Triton's palace and features seashell-inspired architecture. This \"port of call\" is mostly indoors and recreates the feeling of being underwater.  Attractions include Flounder's Flying Fish Coaster; [[Scuttle's Scooters]]; [[Jumpin' Jellyfish]]; Blowfish Balloon Race; The Whirlpool; all of which are children's rides. Also in this area are Ariel's Playground, which is a children's playground and extensive walk-through attraction that recreates the various settings in the movie; and the Mermaid Lagoon Theater, which houses 'King Triton's Concert', a musical show featuring live actors, large-scale [[puppetry]] and [[Audio-Animatronics]] that recreate the story of The Little Mermaid.\n\n===Arabian Coast===\nThis is themed after ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. It recreates an Arabian harbor combined with an \"enchanted world from 1001 Arabian Nights\". There are four attractions in the land: [[Sindbad's Storybook Voyage]], an indoor [[dark ride]] boat ride whose art direction seems to be (at first glance) a variation on \"[[It's a Small World]]\" (with its own theme song, \"Compass of your Heart\", composed by [[Alan Menken]]); Caravan Carousel, a double-decker [[carousel]] that holds over 190 passengers; Jasmine's Flying Carpets; and the Magic Lamp Theater, which houses a combined live-action/animatronic based magic show with a 3D movie featuring the [[Genie (Disney's Aladdin)|Genie]].\n\n===Lost River Delta===\nLocated at the back of the park, the dominant structure in this \"port of call\" is the ruins of an ancient [[Aztec]] pyramid which houses the dark thrill ride, [[Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull]]. Also in the Lost River Delta is the DisneySea Steamer Line which transports guests back to Mediterranean Harbor, 'Out of Shadowland', a live theatrical show that follows Mei, a young girl lost in a world of shadows who finds confidence and strength through her sojourn there. Furthermore, the Lost River Delta contains an [[Intamin]] [[roller coaster]] named [[Raging Spirits]], which opened in 2005 and is similar to [[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril]] at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] in Paris.\n\n===Port Discovery===\nThis \"port of call\" is home to the fictional 'Marine Life Institute'; Port Discovery houses two attractions: [[Aquatopia]], a boat ride that uses LPS tracking (the 'trackless' technology also used in Tokyo Disneyland's [[Pooh's Hunny Hunt]]) to move and spin through a lagoon amid waterfalls and whirlpools, and the {{RailGauge|2ft6in|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[DisneySea Electric Railway]], an overhead electric trolley that transports riders to and from the American Waterfront. On 12 May 2017, the land became home to [[Nemo & Friends SeaRider]] based on [[Finding Nemo]]/[[Finding Dory]] which replaced the former [[StormRider]] simulator.<ref>{{cite web|title=New \"Finding Nemo\" attraction coming to Tokyo DisneySea Park in Spring 2017, StormRider to close|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/headlines/new-finding-nemo-attraction-coming-to-tokyo-disneysea-park-in-spring-2017-stormrider-to-close/|website=Inside the Magic|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===American Waterfront===\nThis \"port of call\" represents the northeastern seaboard of the United States in the early 20th century. It features two themed areas, an \"Old Cape Cod\" section, and a \"New York Harbor\" section. The land is dominated by a large passenger ship, [[SS Columbia (Tokyo DisneySea)|SS ''Columbia'']], which is usually the site for various shows and events. Guests have the option of riding the area's \"Big City Vehicles\" which roam the streets of the area. It also features the {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge [[DisneySea Electric Railway]], which takes passengers from The American Waterfront to nearby Port Discovery. The port has a Broadway-themed theater which plays the show \"Big Band Beat\", which features 1940s-style swing jazz performed by a 12-piece band, as well as 20 singers/dancers.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> The port's most popular attraction is the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Tower of Terror]], an elaborately themed free-fall [[E ticket|E-ticket]] ride.<ref name=\"Owen\"/>\n\n[[Toy Story Mania]] is an interactive 4-D theme park attraction located at the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park.<ref name=\"Toy Story Mania\">{{cite web|title=Toy Story Mania |url=http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/attraction/detail/str_id:aw_toy/|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> It is inspired by Disney [[Pixar|Pixar's]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]].

The entrance to the park is Mediterranean Harbor, which opens up to six more nautically themed ports: American Waterfront, Lost River Delta, Port Discovery, Mermaid Lagoon, Arabian Coast, and Mysterious Island.<ref name=\"Owen\"/>\n\n===Mediterranean Harbor===\nMediterranean Harbor is the entrance \"port-of-call\" and themed as an Italian port city, with [[Venetian Gondolas]] that guests can board and ride.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Littered throughout the port are various shops and restaurants.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Russell |first= Chick |title= Explore Tokyo DisneySea |journal= SimonSeeks |origyear= 3/12/10 |date= May 2010 |issue= 1 |url= http://chickrussell.com/caseStudies/documents/Explore%20Tokyo%20DisneySea%20_%20Simonseeks.pdf |accessdate= 25 August 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331062909/http://chickrussell.com/caseStudies/documents/Explore%20Tokyo%20DisneySea%20_%20Simonseeks.pdf |archive-date= 31 March 2012 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Mediterranean Harbor's layout differs from the entry \"lands\" of other Disney parks as it is a large \"V\" shape rather than a main street that leads to a hub (as found in [[Disneyland]]'s [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] or [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]' Hollywood Boulevard\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Pendry|first=Cheryl|title=Tokyo DisneySea: The Most Amazing Disney Park Ever?|url=http://www.passporter.com/articles/tokyo-disneysea.html|publisher=Passporter Theme Park and Travel Reviews|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> To the right, the path leads to Mysterious Island, and to the left, the path leads to the American Waterfront. Built into the architecture of the port is [[Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta]]; the hotel serves as a full-scale reproduction of the various buildings of Portofino and Venice's ports, and serves as the southern berm (or border) of the park. The design choice of combining a real hotel within the themed park areas helps to further the illusion that (as either a park or hotel guest) you are in an actual city; since the hotel is a functional building (rather than a 'set facade' -- the general standard in theme park designs) the  effect of onlooking hotel guests, that may observe the park from hotel's rooms, balconies, and terraces serve in adding a level of kinetic authenticity in passing for an authentic Italian villa for park visitors, while the hotel guest enjoys the harborside views and novelty of location.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tokyo Disneyland Hotel MiraCosta|url=http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g298162-d617276-Reviews-Tokyo_DisneySea_Hotel_MiraCosta-Urayasu_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html|publisher=TripAdvisor.com|accessdate=14 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tiemann|first=Amy|title=DisneySea blends Disney imagination and Japanese style|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13507_3-9793054-18.html|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=cnet News|date=8 October 2007}}</ref> Mediterranean Harbor also features [[Soarin'|Soaring: Fantastic Flight]], a flying simulator, and \"[[Fortress Explorations]]\", a large-scale interactive play area for guests that features exploration-themed activities and attractions. \n\n===Mysterious Island===\nMysterious Island is a \"port-of-call\" within Mount Prometheus, the giant volcano that is the park's centerpiece and most prominent feature. It relies heavily on the storytelling of [[Jules Verne]] and, specifically, the mythology of the volcano fortress mentioned several times in the books called \"Vulcania\". The Mount Prometheus ride employs technology similar to [[Epcot]]'s [[Test Track]].<ref name=\"Owen\"/> The smallest \"port of call\", it nevertheless holds two of the more popular attractions: \"[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (attraction)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]\", a thrill ride, and \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", a [[dark ride]]. Despite its name, Mysterious Island is not an island; it is built into the side of Mount Prometheus, which is part of the show building for the two attractions. The architecture in this port is of Victorian style.\n\nAttractions include [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (attraction)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]], and the [[dark ride]] [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Tokyo DisneySea)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]].\n\n===Mermaid Lagoon===\nMermaid Lagoon is home to the characters of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. The facade is made to resemble King Triton's palace and features seashell-inspired architecture. This \"port of call\" is mostly indoors and recreates the feeling of being underwater.  Attractions include Flounder's Flying Fish Coaster; [[Scuttle's Scooters]]; [[Jumpin' Jellyfish]]; Blowfish Balloon Race; The Whirlpool; all of which are children's rides. Also in this area are Ariel's Playground, which is a children's playground and extensive walk-through attraction that recreates the various settings in the movie; and the Mermaid Lagoon Theater, which houses 'King Triton's Concert', a musical show featuring live actors, large-scale [[puppetry]] and [[Audio-Animatronics]] that recreate the story of The Little Mermaid.\n\n===Arabian Coast===\nThis is themed after ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. It recreates an Arabian harbor combined with an \"enchanted world from 1001 Arabian Nights\". There are four attractions in the land: [[Sindbad's Storybook Voyage]], an indoor [[dark ride]] boat ride whose art direction seems to be (at first glance) a variation on \"[[It's a Small World]]\" (with its own theme song, \"Compass of your Heart\", composed by [[Alan Menken]]); Caravan Carousel, a double-decker [[carousel]] that holds over 190 passengers; Jasmine's Flying Carpets; and the Magic Lamp Theater, which houses a combined live-action/animatronic based magic show with a 3D movie featuring the [[Genie (Disney's Aladdin)|Genie]].\n\n===Lost River Delta===\nLocated at the back of the park, the dominant structure in this \"port of call\" is the ruins of an ancient [[Aztec]] pyramid which houses the dark thrill ride, [[Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull]]. Also in the Lost River Delta is the DisneySea Steamer Line which transports guests back to Mediterranean Harbor, 'Out of Shadowland', a live theatrical show that follows Mei, a young girl lost in a world of shadows who finds confidence and strength through her sojourn there. Furthermore, the Lost River Delta contains an [[Intamin]] [[roller coaster]] named [[Raging Spirits]], which opened in 2005 and is similar to [[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril]] at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] in Paris.\n\n===Port Discovery===\nThis \"port of call\" is home to the fictional 'Marine Life Institute'; Port Discovery houses two attractions: [[Aquatopia]], a boat ride that uses LPS tracking (the 'trackless' technology also used in Tokyo Disneyland's [[Pooh's Hunny Hunt]]) to move and spin through a lagoon amid waterfalls and whirlpools, and the {{RailGauge|2ft6in|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[DisneySea Electric Railway]], an overhead electric trolley that transports riders to and from the American Waterfront. On 12 May 2017, the land became home to [[Nemo & Friends SeaRider]] based on [[Finding Nemo]]/[[Finding Dory]] which replaced the former [[StormRider]] simulator.<ref>{{cite web|title=New \"Finding Nemo\" attraction coming to Tokyo DisneySea Park in Spring 2017, StormRider to close|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/headlines/new-finding-nemo-attraction-coming-to-tokyo-disneysea-park-in-spring-2017-stormrider-to-close/|website=Inside the Magic|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===American Waterfront===\nThis \"port of call\" represents the northeastern seaboard of the United States in the early 20th century. It features two themed areas, an \"Old Cape Cod\" section, and a \"New York Harbor\" section. The land is dominated by a large passenger ship, [[SS Columbia (Tokyo DisneySea)|SS ''Columbia'']], which is usually the site for various shows and events. Guests have the option of riding the area's \"Big City Vehicles\" which roam the streets of the area. It also features the {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge [[DisneySea Electric Railway]], which takes passengers from The American Waterfront to nearby Port Discovery. The port has a Broadway-themed theater which plays the show \"Big Band Beat\", which features 1940s-style swing jazz performed by a 12-piece band, as well as 20 singers/dancers.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> The port's most popular attraction is the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Tower of Terror]], an elaborately themed free-fall [[E ticket|E-ticket]] ride.<ref name=\"Owen\"/>\n\n[[Toy Story Mania]] is an interactive 4-D theme park attraction located at the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park.<ref name=\"Toy Story Mania\">{{cite web|title=Toy Story Mania |url=http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/attraction/detail/str_id:aw_toy/|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> It is inspired by Disney [[Pixar|Pixar's]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]].
