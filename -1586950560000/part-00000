Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), [[natural time analysis]] is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a [[critical phenomena|critical phenomenon]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|2006}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle et al.|2012}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Huang|2015}}.</ref><ref name=\"Uyeda 2009\">{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|Tanaka|2009}}</ref> \n\nAfter 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at [[arxiv.org]]. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9. VAN's report was also described in an article in the  [[Ethnos (newspaper)|newspaper Ethnos]] on Feb. 10, 2008.<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Apostolidis|2008}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Chouliaras|2009}}</ref> However, Gerassimos Papadopolous complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that \"none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Papadopoulos|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Description of the VAN method==\nPrediction of earthquakes with this method is based on the detection, recording and evaluation of seismic electric signals or SES. These electrical signals have a fundamental [[frequency]] component of 1&nbsp;Hz or less and an amplitude the logarithm of which scales with the [[earthquake magnitude|magnitude of the earthquake]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|1981a}};\n{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|Papaioannou|1981}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|1982}}.</ref> According to VAN proponents, SES are emitted by rocks under [[mechanical stress|stresses]] caused by plate-tectonic forces.  There are three types of reported electric signal:<ref name=\"Varotsos 1993\"/>\n\n*Electric signals that occur shortly before a major earthquake. Signals of this type were recorded 6.5 hours before the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|1995 Kobe earthquake]] in Japan, for example.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matsumoto|Ikeya|Yamanaka|1998}}.</ref>\n*Electric signals that occur some time before a major earthquake.\n*A gradual variation in the Earth's electric field some time before an earthquake.\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain SES:\n*Stress-related phenomena: Seismic electric signals are perhaps attributed to the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric behaviour]] of some [[mineral]]s, especially [[quartz]], or to effects related to the behavior of [[crystallographic defects]] under stress or strain. Series of SES, termed SES activities (which are recorded before major earthquakes), may appear a few weeks to a few months before an earthquake when the mechanical stress reaches a critical value.<ref name=\"Varotsos 1984\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|Lazaridou|1986|p=120}}.</ref> The generation of electric signals by minerals under high stress leading to fracture has been confirmed with laboratory experiments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hadjicontis|Mavromatou|Antsygina|Chishko|2007}}</ref>\n*Thermoelectric phenomena: Alternately, Chinese researchers proposed a mechanism which relies on the thermoelectric effect in magnetite.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shen|Zhang|Wang|Chen|2011}}.</ref>\n*Groundwater phenomena: Three mechanisms have been proposed relying on the presence of groundwater in generating SES. The electrokinetic effect is associated with the motion of groundwater during a change in pore pressure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gershenzon|Gokhberg|Yunga|1993}}.</ref> The seismic dynamo effect is associated with the motion of ions in groundwater relative to the geomagnetic field as a seismic wave creates displacement. Circular polarization would be characteristic of the seismic dynamo effect, and this has been observed both for artificial and natural seismic events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Honkura|Ogawa|Matsushima|Nagaoka|2009}}.</ref> A radon ionization effect, caused by radon release and then subsequent ionization of material in groundwater, may also be active. The main isotope of radon is radioactive with a half-life of 3.9 days, and the nuclear decay of radon is known to have an ionizing effect on air. Many publications have reported increased radon concentration in the vicinity of some active tectonic faults a few weeks prior to strong seismic events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pulinets|2007}}.</ref>  However, a strong correlation between radon anomalies and seismic events has not been demonstrated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=334}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the electrokinetic effect may be consistent with signal detection tens or hundreds of kilometers away, the other mechanisms require a second mechanism to account for propagation:\n*Signal transmission along faults: In one model, seismic electric signals propagate with relatively low attenuation along tectonic [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, due to the increased [[electrical conductivity]] caused either by the intrusion of ground water into the fault zone(s) or by the ionic characteristics of the minerals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Lazaridou|Kapiris|1998}}.</ref>\n*Rock circuit: In the defect model, the presence of charge carriers and holes can be modeled as making an extensive circuit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|1998}}.</ref>\n\nSeismic electric signals are detected at stations which consist of pairs of electrodes (oriented NS and EW) inserted into the ground, with amplifiers and filters. The signals are then transmitted to the VAN scientists in Athens where they are recorded and evaluated. Currently the VAN team operates 9 stations, while in the past (until 1989) they could afford up to 17.<ref name=\"Varotsos 1991\">{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Lazaridou|1991}}</ref>\n\nThe VAN team claimed that they were able to predict earthquakes of magnitude larger than 5, with an [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] of 0.7 units of magnitude, within a radius of 100&nbsp;km, and in time window ranging from several hours to a few weeks. Several papers confirmed this success rate, leading to statistically significant conclusion.<ref name=\"Hamada 1993\">{{Harvnb|Hamada|1993}}</ref> For example, there were eight M \u2265 5.5 earthquakes in Greece from January 1, 1984 through September 10, 1995, and the VAN network forecast six of these.<ref name=\":1\">{{Harvnb|Uyeda|1996}}</ref>\n\nThe VAN method has also been used in Japan,<ref name=\"Uyeda 2009\"/> but in early attempts success comparable to that achieved in Greece was \"difficult\" to attain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Utada|1993|p=153}}</ref> A preliminary investigation of seismic electric signals in France led to encouraging results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maron|Baubron|Herbreteau|Massinon|1993}}</ref>\n\n==Earthquake prediction using \"natural time\" analysis==\n\nSince 2001 the VAN team has attempted to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of the forthcoming earthquake. To that end, they introduced the concept of ''natural time'', a time series analysis technique which puts weight on a process based on the ordering of events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|2006}}.</ref> Two terms characterize each event, the \"natural time\" {{math|&chi;}}, and the energy {{math|''Q''}}. {{math|&chi;}} is defined as {{math|''k''/''N''}}, where ''k'' is an integer (the {{math|''k''}}-th event) and {{math|''N''}}  is the total number of events in the time sequence of data. A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. They introduce a critical term {{math|&kappa;}}, the \"variance in natural time\", which puts extra weight on the energy term {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}:\n\n:<math>\\kappa=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n:where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math> \n\nTheir current method deems SES valid when {{math|&kappa;}} = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a Venn diagram with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When the distribution of {{math|&kappa;}} for the rectangular regions has its maximum at {{math|&kappa;}} = 0.070, a critical seismic event is imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so, and a report is issued.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2011}}, Chapter 7.</ref>\n\n=== Results ===\nThe VAN team claim that out of seven mainshocks with magnitude Mw>=6.0 from 2001 through 2010 in the region of latitude N 36\u00b0 to N 41\u00b0 and longitude E 19\u00b0 to E 27\u00b0, all but one could be classified with relevant SES activity identified and reported in advance through natural time analysis. Additionally, they assert that the occurrence time of four of these mainshocks with magnitude Mw>=6.4 were identified to within \"a narrow range, a few days to around one week or so.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2011|p=326}}</ref> These reports are inserted in papers housed in arXiv, and new reports are made and uploaded there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lazaridou-Varotsos|2013|pp=169\u2013170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcoO-mtsPMgC&pg=PA169}}</ref>  For example, a report preceding the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011, which occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9, was publicized in arXiv almost two weeks before, on February 1, 2008.<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|2008}}</ref> A description of the updated VAN method was collected in a book published by Springer in 2011, titled \"Natural Time Analysis: The New View of Time.\"<ref name=\"Varotsos 2011\">{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2011}}</ref>\n\nNatural time analysis also claims that the physical connection of SES activities with earthquakes is as follows: Taking the view that the earthquake occurrence is a phase-change (critical phenomenon), where the new phase is the mainshock occurrence, the above-mentioned variance term \u03ba is the corresponding order parameter.<ref name=\"Varotsos 2011\"/> The \u03ba value calculated for a window comprising a number of seismic events comparable to the average number of earthquakes occurring within a few months, fluctuates when the window is sliding through a seismic catalogue. The VAN team claims that these \u03ba fluctuations exhibit a minimum a few months before a mainshock occurrence and in addition this minimum occurs simultaneously with the initiation of the corresponding SES activity, and that this is the first time in the literature that such a simultaneous appearance of two precursory phenomena in independent datasets of different geophysical observables (electrical measurements, seismicity) has been observed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|Lazaridou|2013}}</ref> Furthermore, the VAN team claims that their natural time analysis of the seismic catalogue of Japan during the period from January 1, 1984 until the occurrence of the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, revealed that such clear minima of the \u03ba fluctuations appeared before all major earthquakes with magnitude 7.6 or larger. The deepest of these minima was said to occur on January 5, 2011, i.e., almost two months before the Tohoku earthquake occurrence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarlis|Skordas|Varotsos|Nagao|2013}}</ref> Finally, by dividing the Japanese region into small areas, the VAN team states that some small areas show minimum of the \u03ba fluctuations almost simultaneously with the large area covering the whole Japan and such small areas clustered within a few hundred kilometers from the actual epicenter of the impending major earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarlis|Skordas|Varotsos|Nagao|2015}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Huang|2015}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms of VAN==\n\nHistorically, the usefulness of the VAN method for prediction of earthquakes had been a matter of debate. Both positive and negative criticism on an older conception of the VAN method is summarized in the 1996 book \"A Critical Review of VAN\", edited by Sir James Lighthill.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lighthill|1996}}.</ref> A critical review of the statistical methodology was published by Y. Y. Kagan of UCLA in 1997.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|1997 |p=512}}.</ref> Note that these criticisms predate the time series analysis methods introduced by the VAN group in 2001.  The main points of the criticism were:\n\n===Predictive success=== \nCritics say that the VAN method is hindered by a lack of statistical testing of the validity of the hypothesis because the researchers keep changing the parameters (the [[moving the goalposts#logical fallacy|moving the goalposts]]) technique).<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992}}; {{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1996}}; \n{{Harvnb|Wyss|1996b}}.</ref> \n\nVAN has claimed to have observed at a recording station in Athens a perfect record of a one-to-one correlation between SESs and earthquake of magnitude \u2265 2.9 which occurred 7 hours later in all of Greece.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|1981b}}.</ref>  However, Max Wyss said that the list of earthquake used for the correlation was false. Although VAN stated in their article that the list of earthquakes was that of the Bulletin of the [[National Observatory of Athens]] (NOA), Wyss found that 37% of the earthquakes actually listed in the bulletin, including the largest one, were not in the list used by VAN for issuing their claim. In addition, 40% of the earthquake which VAN claimed had occurred were not in the NOA bulletin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|1996a}}.</ref>  Examining the probability of chance correlation of another set of 22 claims of successful predictions by VAN of M > 4.0  from January 1, 1987 through November 30, 1989 <ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Lazaridou|1991}}.</ref> it was found that 74% were false, 9% correlated by chance, and for 14% the correlation was uncertain. No single event correlated at a probability greater than 85%, whereas the level required in statistics for accepting a hypothesis test as positive would more commonly be 95%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|Allmann|1996}}.</ref> \n\nIn response to Wyss' analysis of the NOA findings, VAN said that the criticisms were based on misunderstandings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Eftaxias|Lazaridou|Dologlou|1996a}}</ref> VAN said that the calculations suggested by Wyss would lead to a paradox, i.e., to probability values larger than unity, when applied to an ideal earthquake prediction method.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Eftaxias|Lazaridou|Dologlou|1996b}}</ref> Other independent evaluations said that VAN obtained statistically significant results.<ref name=\"Hamada 1993\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nMainstream seismologists remain unconvinced by any of VAN's rebuttals. In 2011 the ICEF concluded that the optimistic prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=335\u2013336}}.</ref> Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \"resoundingly debunked\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=195}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed SES propagation mechanism=== \nAn analysis of the propagation properties of SES in the Earth\u2019s crust showed that it is impossible that signals with the amplitude reported by VAN could have been generated by small earthquakes and transmitted over the several hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bernard|1992}};  {{Harvnb|Bernard|LeMouel|1996}}.</ref>  In effect, if the mechanism is based on piezoelectricity or electrical charging of crystal deformations with the signal traveling along faults, then none of the earthquakes which VAN claimed were preceded by SES generated an SES themselves. VAN answered that such an analysis of the SES propagation properties is based on a simplified model of horizontally layered Earth and that this differs greatly&nbsp;from the real situation since&nbsp;Earth's crust contains inhomogeneities. When the latter are taken into account, for example by considering that the faults are electrically&nbsp;appreciably more conductive than the surrounding medium, VAN believes that electric signals transmitted at distances of the order of one hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station have amplitudes comparable to those reported by VAN.<ref name=\":0\" /> Susan Hough noted that this amounted to special pleading, making VAN's hypothesis un-falsifiable because it relies on unrepeatable circumstances.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=195}}</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic compatibility issues=== \nVAN\u2019s publications are further weakened by failure to address the problem of eliminating the many and strong sources of change in the magneto-electric field measured by them, such as [[telluric current]]s from weather, and [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) from man-made signals.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  One critical paper (Pham et al 1998) clearly correlates an SES used by the VAN group with digital radio transmissions made from a military base.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Le Mou\u00ebl|1998}}.</ref> In a subsequent paper, VAN said that such noise coming from digital radio transmitters of the military database has been clearly distinguished from true SES by following the criteria developed by VAN.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarlis|Lazaridou|Kapiris|Varotsos|1999}}</ref> Further work in Greece by Pham et al in 2002 has tracked SES-like \"anomalous transient electric signals\" back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Savvaidis|2002}}.</ref>\n===Public policy=== \nFinally, one requirement for any earthquake prediction method is that, in order for any prediction to be useful, it must predict a forthcoming earthquake within a reasonable time-frame, epicenter and magnitude. If the prediction is too vague, no feasible decision (such as to evacuate the population of a certain area for a given period of time) can be made. In practice, the VAN group issued a series of telegrams in the 1980s, warning of impending earthquakes that did not occur, or did not occur within the parameters listed in the telegrams. During the same time frame, the technique also missed major earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamada|1993}}.</ref> These inaccurate predictions from the early VAN method led to public criticism and the cost associated with false alarms generated ill will.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Geller|2003}}, p. 318.</ref>  Major opponents of VAN were the Greek seismologists [[Vassilis Papazachos]] and G. Stavrakakis. The debate between Papazachos and the VAN team has repeatedly caused public attention in their home country [[Greece]] and has been extensively discussed in the Greek media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Earthquake prediction]]\n* [[Seismology]]\n* [[Seismo-electromagnetics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation\n |first = C. | last = Apostolidis\n |url          = http://www.ethnos.gr/koinonia/arthro/problepsi_gia_seismo_6_rixter-444473/\n |title        = Problepsi gia seismo 6 rixter\n |date         = 2008-02-10\n |website      = [[Ethnos (newspaper)|Ethnos]]\n |publisher    = Pegasus Publishing\n |language     = Greek\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160715213217/http://www.ethnos.gr/koinonia/arthro/problepsi_gia_seismo_6_rixter-444473/\n |archivedate  = 2016-07-15 |access-date  = 2016-07-16\n |url-status     = live\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |first1= P. |last1= Bernard\n |year= 1992\n |title= Plausibility of long distance electrotelluric precursors to earthquakes \n |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research \n |volume= 97 |issue= B12\n |pages= 17531\u201317546\n |bibcode = 1992JGR....9717531B\n |doi = 10.1029/92JB01215\n}}\n*{{Citation\n |first1= P. |last1= Bernard\n |first2= J. |last2= LeMouel\n |chapter= On electrotelluric signals \n |editor= Sir James Lighthill \n |title= A Critical Review of VAN \u2013 Earthquake Prediction from Seismic Electrical Signals \n |year= 1996 \n |isbn= 978-981-02-2670-1 \n |publisher= World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd\n |location= London, UK \n |pages= 118\u2013154\n}}\n*{{Citation\n |first = G |last = Chouliaras\n |title      = Seismicity anomalies prior to 8 June 2008 earthquake in Western Greece\n |journal    = Nat.

Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a [[critical phenomena|critical phenomenon]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|2006}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle et al.|2012}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Huang|2015}}.</ref><ref name=\"Uyeda 2009\">{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|Tanaka|2009}}</ref> \n\nAfter 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at [[arxiv.org]]. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9. VAN's report was also described in an article in the  [[Ethnos (newspaper)|newspaper Ethnos]] on Feb. 10, 2008.<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Apostolidis|2008}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Chouliaras|2009}}</ref> However, Gerassimos Papadopolous complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that \"none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Papadopoulos|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Description of the VAN method==\nPrediction of earthquakes with this method is based on the detection, recording and evaluation of seismic electric signals or SES. These electrical signals have a fundamental [[frequency]] component of 1&nbsp;Hz or less and an amplitude the logarithm of which scales with the [[earthquake magnitude|magnitude of the earthquake]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|1981a}};\n{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|Papaioannou|1981}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|1982}}.</ref> According to VAN proponents, SES are emitted by rocks under [[mechanical stress|stresses]] caused by plate-tectonic forces.  There are three types of reported electric signal:<ref name=\"Varotsos 1993\"/>\n\n*Electric signals that occur shortly before a major earthquake. Signals of this type were recorded 6.5 hours before the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|1995 Kobe earthquake]] in Japan, for example.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matsumoto|Ikeya|Yamanaka|1998}}.</ref>\n*Electric signals that occur some time before a major earthquake.\n*A gradual variation in the Earth's electric field some time before an earthquake.\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain SES:\n*Stress-related phenomena: Seismic electric signals are perhaps attributed to the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric behaviour]] of some [[mineral]]s, especially [[quartz]], or to effects related to the behavior of [[crystallographic defects]] under stress or strain. Series of SES, termed SES activities (which are recorded before major earthquakes), may appear a few weeks to a few months before an earthquake when the mechanical stress reaches a critical value.<ref name=\"Varotsos 1984\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|Lazaridou|1986|p=120}}.</ref> The generation of electric signals by minerals under high stress leading to fracture has been confirmed with laboratory experiments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hadjicontis|Mavromatou|Antsygina|Chishko|2007}}</ref>\n*Thermoelectric phenomena: Alternately, Chinese researchers proposed a mechanism which relies on the thermoelectric effect in magnetite.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shen|Zhang|Wang|Chen|2011}}.</ref>\n*Groundwater phenomena: Three mechanisms have been proposed relying on the presence of groundwater in generating SES. The electrokinetic effect is associated with the motion of groundwater during a change in pore pressure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gershenzon|Gokhberg|Yunga|1993}}.</ref> The seismic dynamo effect is associated with the motion of ions in groundwater relative to the geomagnetic field as a seismic wave creates displacement. Circular polarization would be characteristic of the seismic dynamo effect, and this has been observed both for artificial and natural seismic events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Honkura|Ogawa|Matsushima|Nagaoka|2009}}.</ref> A radon ionization effect, caused by radon release and then subsequent ionization of material in groundwater, may also be active. The main isotope of radon is radioactive with a half-life of 3.9 days, and the nuclear decay of radon is known to have an ionizing effect on air. Many publications have reported increased radon concentration in the vicinity of some active tectonic faults a few weeks prior to strong seismic events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pulinets|2007}}.</ref>  However, a strong correlation between radon anomalies and seismic events has not been demonstrated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=334}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the electrokinetic effect may be consistent with signal detection tens or hundreds of kilometers away, the other mechanisms require a second mechanism to account for propagation:\n*Signal transmission along faults: In one model, seismic electric signals propagate with relatively low attenuation along tectonic [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, due to the increased [[electrical conductivity]] caused either by the intrusion of ground water into the fault zone(s) or by the ionic characteristics of the minerals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Lazaridou|Kapiris|1998}}.</ref>\n*Rock circuit: In the defect model, the presence of charge carriers and holes can be modeled as making an extensive circuit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|1998}}.</ref>\n\nSeismic electric signals are detected at stations which consist of pairs of electrodes (oriented NS and EW) inserted into the ground, with amplifiers and filters. The signals are then transmitted to the VAN scientists in Athens where they are recorded and evaluated. Currently the VAN team operates 9 stations, while in the past (until 1989) they could afford up to 17.<ref name=\"Varotsos 1991\">{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Lazaridou|1991}}</ref>\n\nThe VAN team claimed that they were able to predict earthquakes of magnitude larger than 5, with an [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] of 0.7 units of magnitude, within a radius of 100&nbsp;km, and in time window ranging from several hours to a few weeks. Several papers confirmed this success rate, leading to statistically significant conclusion.<ref name=\"Hamada 1993\">{{Harvnb|Hamada|1993}}</ref> For example, there were eight M \u2265 5.5 earthquakes in Greece from January 1, 1984 through September 10, 1995, and the VAN network forecast six of these.<ref name=\":1\">{{Harvnb|Uyeda|1996}}</ref>\n\nThe VAN method has also been used in Japan,<ref name=\"Uyeda 2009\"/> but in early attempts success comparable to that achieved in Greece was \"difficult\" to attain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Utada|1993|p=153}}</ref> A preliminary investigation of seismic electric signals in France led to encouraging results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maron|Baubron|Herbreteau|Massinon|1993}}</ref>\n\n==Earthquake prediction using \"natural time\" analysis==\n\nSince 2001 the VAN team has attempted to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of the forthcoming earthquake. To that end, they introduced the concept of ''natural time'', a time series analysis technique which puts weight on a process based on the ordering of events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|2006}}.</ref> Two terms characterize each event, the \"natural time\" {{math|&chi;}}, and the energy {{math|''Q''}}. {{math|&chi;}} is defined as {{math|''k''/''N''}}, where ''k'' is an integer (the {{math|''k''}}-th event) and {{math|''N''}}  is the total number of events in the time sequence of data. A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. They introduce a critical term {{math|&kappa;}}, the \"variance in natural time\", which puts extra weight on the energy term {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}:\n\n:<math>\\kappa=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n:where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math> \n\nTheir current method deems SES valid when {{math|&kappa;}} = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a Venn diagram with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When the distribution of {{math|&kappa;}} for the rectangular regions has its maximum at {{math|&kappa;}} = 0.070, a critical seismic event is imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so, and a report is issued.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2011}}, Chapter 7.</ref>\n\n=== Results ===\nThe VAN team claim that out of seven mainshocks with magnitude Mw>=6.0 from 2001 through 2010 in the region of latitude N 36\u00b0 to N 41\u00b0 and longitude E 19\u00b0 to E 27\u00b0, all but one could be classified with relevant SES activity identified and reported in advance through natural time analysis. Additionally, they assert that the occurrence time of four of these mainshocks with magnitude Mw>=6.4 were identified to within \"a narrow range, a few days to around one week or so.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2011|p=326}}</ref> These reports are inserted in papers housed in arXiv, and new reports are made and uploaded there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lazaridou-Varotsos|2013|pp=169\u2013170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcoO-mtsPMgC&pg=PA169}}</ref>  For example, a report preceding the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011, which occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9, was publicized in arXiv almost two weeks before, on February 1, 2008.<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|2008}}</ref> A description of the updated VAN method was collected in a book published by Springer in 2011, titled \"Natural Time Analysis: The New View of Time.\"<ref name=\"Varotsos 2011\">{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2011}}</ref>\n\nNatural time analysis also claims that the physical connection of SES activities with earthquakes is as follows: Taking the view that the earthquake occurrence is a phase-change (critical phenomenon), where the new phase is the mainshock occurrence, the above-mentioned variance term \u03ba is the corresponding order parameter.<ref name=\"Varotsos 2011\"/> The \u03ba value calculated for a window comprising a number of seismic events comparable to the average number of earthquakes occurring within a few months, fluctuates when the window is sliding through a seismic catalogue. The VAN team claims that these \u03ba fluctuations exhibit a minimum a few months before a mainshock occurrence and in addition this minimum occurs simultaneously with the initiation of the corresponding SES activity, and that this is the first time in the literature that such a simultaneous appearance of two precursory phenomena in independent datasets of different geophysical observables (electrical measurements, seismicity) has been observed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|Lazaridou|2013}}</ref> Furthermore, the VAN team claims that their natural time analysis of the seismic catalogue of Japan during the period from January 1, 1984 until the occurrence of the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, revealed that such clear minima of the \u03ba fluctuations appeared before all major earthquakes with magnitude 7.6 or larger. The deepest of these minima was said to occur on January 5, 2011, i.e., almost two months before the Tohoku earthquake occurrence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarlis|Skordas|Varotsos|Nagao|2013}}</ref> Finally, by dividing the Japanese region into small areas, the VAN team states that some small areas show minimum of the \u03ba fluctuations almost simultaneously with the large area covering the whole Japan and such small areas clustered within a few hundred kilometers from the actual epicenter of the impending major earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarlis|Skordas|Varotsos|Nagao|2015}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Huang|2015}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms of VAN==\n\nHistorically, the usefulness of the VAN method for prediction of earthquakes had been a matter of debate. Both positive and negative criticism on an older conception of the VAN method is summarized in the 1996 book \"A Critical Review of VAN\", edited by Sir James Lighthill.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lighthill|1996}}.</ref> A critical review of the statistical methodology was published by Y. Y. Kagan of UCLA in 1997.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|1997 |p=512}}.</ref> Note that these criticisms predate the time series analysis methods introduced by the VAN group in 2001.  The main points of the criticism were:\n\n===Predictive success=== \nCritics say that the VAN method is hindered by a lack of statistical testing of the validity of the hypothesis because the researchers keep changing the parameters (the [[moving the goalposts#logical fallacy|moving the goalposts]]) technique).<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992}}; {{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1996}}; \n{{Harvnb|Wyss|1996b}}.</ref> \n\nVAN has claimed to have observed at a recording station in Athens a perfect record of a one-to-one correlation between SESs and earthquake of magnitude \u2265 2.9 which occurred 7 hours later in all of Greece.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Nomicos|1981b}}.</ref>  However, Max Wyss said that the list of earthquake used for the correlation was false. Although VAN stated in their article that the list of earthquakes was that of the Bulletin of the [[National Observatory of Athens]] (NOA), Wyss found that 37% of the earthquakes actually listed in the bulletin, including the largest one, were not in the list used by VAN for issuing their claim. In addition, 40% of the earthquake which VAN claimed had occurred were not in the NOA bulletin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|1996a}}.</ref>  Examining the probability of chance correlation of another set of 22 claims of successful predictions by VAN of M > 4.0  from January 1, 1987 through November 30, 1989 <ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Lazaridou|1991}}.</ref> it was found that 74% were false, 9% correlated by chance, and for 14% the correlation was uncertain. No single event correlated at a probability greater than 85%, whereas the level required in statistics for accepting a hypothesis test as positive would more commonly be 95%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|Allmann|1996}}.</ref> \n\nIn response to Wyss' analysis of the NOA findings, VAN said that the criticisms were based on misunderstandings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Eftaxias|Lazaridou|Dologlou|1996a}}</ref> VAN said that the calculations suggested by Wyss would lead to a paradox, i.e., to probability values larger than unity, when applied to an ideal earthquake prediction method.<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Eftaxias|Lazaridou|Dologlou|1996b}}</ref> Other independent evaluations said that VAN obtained statistically significant results.<ref name=\"Hamada 1993\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nMainstream seismologists remain unconvinced by any of VAN's rebuttals. In 2011 the ICEF concluded that the optimistic prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=335\u2013336}}.</ref> Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \"resoundingly debunked\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=195}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed SES propagation mechanism=== \nAn analysis of the propagation properties of SES in the Earth\u2019s crust showed that it is impossible that signals with the amplitude reported by VAN could have been generated by small earthquakes and transmitted over the several hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bernard|1992}};  {{Harvnb|Bernard|LeMouel|1996}}.</ref>  In effect, if the mechanism is based on piezoelectricity or electrical charging of crystal deformations with the signal traveling along faults, then none of the earthquakes which VAN claimed were preceded by SES generated an SES themselves. VAN answered that such an analysis of the SES propagation properties is based on a simplified model of horizontally layered Earth and that this differs greatly&nbsp;from the real situation since&nbsp;Earth's crust contains inhomogeneities. When the latter are taken into account, for example by considering that the faults are electrically&nbsp;appreciably more conductive than the surrounding medium, VAN believes that electric signals transmitted at distances of the order of one hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station have amplitudes comparable to those reported by VAN.<ref name=\":0\" /> Susan Hough noted that this amounted to special pleading, making VAN's hypothesis un-falsifiable because it relies on unrepeatable circumstances.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=195}}</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic compatibility issues=== \nVAN\u2019s publications are further weakened by failure to address the problem of eliminating the many and strong sources of change in the magneto-electric field measured by them, such as [[telluric current]]s from weather, and [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) from man-made signals.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  One critical paper (Pham et al 1998) clearly correlates an SES used by the VAN group with digital radio transmissions made from a military base.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Le Mou\u00ebl|1998}}.</ref> In a subsequent paper, VAN said that such noise coming from digital radio transmitters of the military database has been clearly distinguished from true SES by following the criteria developed by VAN.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarlis|Lazaridou|Kapiris|Varotsos|1999}}</ref> Further work in Greece by Pham et al in 2002 has tracked SES-like \"anomalous transient electric signals\" back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Savvaidis|2002}}.</ref>\n===Public policy=== \nFinally, one requirement for any earthquake prediction method is that, in order for any prediction to be useful, it must predict a forthcoming earthquake within a reasonable time-frame, epicenter and magnitude. If the prediction is too vague, no feasible decision (such as to evacuate the population of a certain area for a given period of time) can be made. In practice, the VAN group issued a series of telegrams in the 1980s, warning of impending earthquakes that did not occur, or did not occur within the parameters listed in the telegrams. During the same time frame, the technique also missed major earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamada|1993}}.</ref> These inaccurate predictions from the early VAN method led to public criticism and the cost associated with false alarms generated ill will.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Geller|2003}}, p. 318.</ref>  Major opponents of VAN were the Greek seismologists [[Vassilis Papazachos]] and G. Stavrakakis. The debate between Papazachos and the VAN team has repeatedly caused public attention in their home country [[Greece]] and has been extensively discussed in the Greek media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Earthquake prediction]]\n* [[Seismology]]\n* [[Seismo-electromagnetics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation\n |first = C. | last = Apostolidis\n |url          = http://www.ethnos.gr/koinonia/arthro/problepsi_gia_seismo_6_rixter-444473/\n |title        = Problepsi gia seismo 6 rixter\n |date         = 2008-02-10\n |website      = [[Ethnos (newspaper)|Ethnos]]\n |publisher    = Pegasus Publishing\n |language     = Greek\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160715213217/http://www.ethnos.gr/koinonia/arthro/problepsi_gia_seismo_6_rixter-444473/\n |archivedate  = 2016-07-15 |access-date  = 2016-07-16\n |url-status     = live\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |first1= P. |last1= Bernard\n |year= 1992\n |title= Plausibility of long distance electrotelluric precursors to earthquakes \n |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research \n |volume= 97 |issue= B12\n |pages= 17531\u201317546\n |bibcode = 1992JGR....9717531B\n |doi = 10.1029/92JB01215\n}}\n*{{Citation\n |first1= P. |last1= Bernard\n |first2= J. |last2= LeMouel\n |chapter= On electrotelluric signals \n |editor= Sir James Lighthill \n |title= A Critical Review of VAN \u2013 Earthquake Prediction from Seismic Electrical Signals \n |year= 1996 \n |isbn= 978-981-02-2670-1 \n |publisher= World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd\n |location= London, UK \n |pages= 118\u2013154\n}}\n*{{Citation\n |first = G |last = Chouliaras\n |title      = Seismicity anomalies prior to 8 June 2008 earthquake in Western Greece\n |journal    = Nat.

{"title_page": "Border ware", "text_new": "[[File:16th_century_Border_Ware_tall_jug.jpg|thumb|16th century Border ware jug]]\n\n'''Border ware''' is a type of post-medieval [[Great Britain|British]] pottery commonly used in [[London]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The lead-glazed, sandy earthenware was produced from kilns along the border between [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. There are two classes of Border ware, fine whitewares and fine redwares. \n\n==History==\nBorder ware evolved from a medieval pottery known as [[Surrey whiteware]]. Surrey whiteware consisted of four classes: [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston-type]] ware, Coarse Border ware, [[Cheam]] whiteware  and Tudor Green ware. The earlier whitewares were produced from the 13th to the 16th centuries.{{sfn|Vince|1985|p=76}}{{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=7}}\n\nBorder ware was manufactured in the Surrey-Hampshire border area from the 16th century to the 19th centuries, although the whitewares were produced only during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The  demand for whitewares declined during the 17th century while the demand for redwares increased..{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=64}} The production of whitewares ended most likely during the early 18th century; Redwares continued to be produced until the 19th century.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:16th_century_Border_ware_flask.jpg|thumb|Border ware flask, 16th century]]\nThe term, \"Border ware\" was introduced by [[Archaeologist|archaeologist]], Clive Orton, to describe the lead-glazed, sandy earthenware produced along the Surrey-Hampshire borders during the early post-medieval period. The pottery is divided into two classes, whitewares and redwares, although the term \"Border ware\" generally refers to the whitewares. The redwares are known as \"Red Border ware.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n===Fabrics===\nWhiteware fabrics are generally hard with a smooth and fine texture. Fabric colours include off-white, yellow, brown, buff, olive and pinkish grey. Glazes are often [[Crazing|crazed]] and finishes range from thin and spotty to thick and glossy. Glaze colours include yellow, brown, olive clear, and green.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=5}}\n\nRedware fabrics range from smooth to slightly rough in feel. Fabric colours generally range from brick red to reddish-yellow. Finishes range from thin and uneven to thick and glossy. A clear lead glaze was often used, giving the pottery products an orange or reddish-brown colour. Other glaze colours include olive, brown and green. Green glaze was created by potters by adding copper to lead glaze.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=6}}\n\n===Forms===\nPottery products were traditional household items commonly used during the post-medieval period.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=69}} [[Skillet|Skillets]], saucepans, chafing dishes and [[Pipkin|tripod pipkins]] were common cookware products manufactured by the Border ware pottery industry.\n[[File:Border_ware_porridger_yellow-glaze.jpg|thumb|left||Border ware porringer]]\nBorder ware forms used for serving and storing food begin with dishes, which are divided into flanged dishes and deep dishes. Bowls were manufactured in a wide variety of shapes and sizes: wide bowls, deep bowls, bowls with handles, and [[Porringer|porringers]]. Vessels for storing and serving liquids include drinking [[Jug|jugs]], [[Cup|cups]], goblets and [[Mug|mugs]]. \n\nOther Border ware forms include costrels (portable flasks), which can be divided into two categories, mammiform costrels and bottle shaped costrels. [[Candlestick|Candlesticks]] were two styles: upright and saucer. There were also [[Lantern|lanterns]], [[Chamber pot|chamber pots]], [[Tudor money box|money boxes]], [[Jar|jars]], double dishes, [[Whistle|whistles]], fuming pots and [[Colander|strainers]].\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box\n|width     =15em\n|border    = 2px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #FFFACD\t\t\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = \"The Hampshire-Surrey border potters had a natural advantage through an accident of geology which is not repeated in other areas near London north of the Thames, nor in Kent, and it applied to every kind of vessel they produced.\"\n|salign    = right\n|source=\u2014 ''F.W. Holling'', 1971.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=65}}}}\n\n===Clay Sources===\n\nThe source of the white-firing clays used to produce Surrey whitewares was the [[Reading Formation|Reading Beds]] along the borders of Hampshire and [[Berkshire]]. The Reading beds between [[Farnham]] and [[Tongham]] were the best source of potting clay for medieval potters producing wares for the London market. These outcrops of white-firing and red-firing clay deposits had provided an abundant source of clays for pottery manufacturing since the early [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=3}}\n\n===Pottery sites===\nBorder ware manufacturing sites were selected for their proximity to plentiful clay and fuel supplies.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=63}}\nThe area northeast of [[Farnham]] became the center of the Border ware pottery industry.

The lead-glazed, sandy earthenware was produced from kilns along the border between [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. There are two classes of Border ware, fine whitewares and fine redwares. \n\n==History==\nBorder ware evolved from a medieval pottery known as [[Surrey whiteware]]. Surrey whiteware consisted of four classes: [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston-type]] ware, Coarse Border ware, [[Cheam]] whiteware  and Tudor Green ware. The earlier whitewares were produced from the 13th to the 16th centuries.{{sfn|Vince|1985|p=76}}{{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=7}}\n\nBorder ware was manufactured in the Surrey-Hampshire border area from the 16th century to the 19th centuries, although the whitewares were produced only during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The  demand for whitewares declined during the 17th century while the demand for redwares increased..{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=64}} The production of whitewares ended most likely during the early 18th century; Redwares continued to be produced until the 19th century.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:16th_century_Border_ware_flask.jpg|thumb|Border ware flask, 16th century]]\nThe term, \"Border ware\" was introduced by [[Archaeologist|archaeologist]], Clive Orton, to describe the lead-glazed, sandy earthenware produced along the Surrey-Hampshire borders during the early post-medieval period. The pottery is divided into two classes, whitewares and redwares, although the term \"Border ware\" generally refers to the whitewares. The redwares are known as \"Red Border ware.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n===Fabrics===\nWhiteware fabrics are generally hard with a smooth and fine texture. Fabric colours include off-white, yellow, brown, buff, olive and pinkish grey. Glazes are often [[Crazing|crazed]] and finishes range from thin and spotty to thick and glossy. Glaze colours include yellow, brown, olive clear, and green.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=5}}\n\nRedware fabrics range from smooth to slightly rough in feel. Fabric colours generally range from brick red to reddish-yellow. Finishes range from thin and uneven to thick and glossy. A clear lead glaze was often used, giving the pottery products an orange or reddish-brown colour. Other glaze colours include olive, brown and green. Green glaze was created by potters by adding copper to lead glaze.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=6}}\n\n===Forms===\nPottery products were traditional household items commonly used during the post-medieval period.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=69}} [[Skillet|Skillets]], saucepans, chafing dishes and [[Pipkin|tripod pipkins]] were common cookware products manufactured by the Border ware pottery industry.\n[[File:Border_ware_porridger_yellow-glaze.jpg|thumb|left||Border ware porringer]]\nBorder ware forms used for serving and storing food begin with dishes, which are divided into flanged dishes and deep dishes. Bowls were manufactured in a wide variety of shapes and sizes: wide bowls, deep bowls, bowls with handles, and [[Porringer|porringers]]. Vessels for storing and serving liquids include drinking [[Jug|jugs]], [[Cup|cups]], goblets and [[Mug|mugs]]. \n\nOther Border ware forms include costrels (portable flasks), which can be divided into two categories, mammiform costrels and bottle shaped costrels. [[Candlestick|Candlesticks]] were two styles: upright and saucer. There were also [[Lantern|lanterns]], [[Chamber pot|chamber pots]], [[Tudor money box|money boxes]], [[Jar|jars]], double dishes, [[Whistle|whistles]], fuming pots and [[Colander|strainers]].\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box\n|width     =15em\n|border    = 2px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #FFFACD\t\t\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = \"The Hampshire-Surrey border potters had a natural advantage through an accident of geology which is not repeated in other areas near London north of the Thames, nor in Kent, and it applied to every kind of vessel they produced.\"\n|salign    = right\n|source=\u2014 ''F.W.

The Reading beds between [[Farnham]] and [[Tongham]] were the best source of potting clay for medieval potters producing wares for the London market. These outcrops of white-firing and red-firing clay deposits had provided an abundant source of clays for pottery manufacturing since the early [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=3}}\n\n===Pottery sites===\nBorder ware manufacturing sites were selected for their proximity to plentiful clay and fuel supplies.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=63}}\nThe area northeast of [[Farnham]] became the center of the Border ware pottery industry.

Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai</ref>\n\nThe Buddhist cultures of [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], traditionally harvested ivory from their domesticated elephants. Ivory was prized for containers due to its ability to keep an airtight seal. It was also commonly carved into elaborate seals utilized by officials to \"sign\" documents and decrees by stamping them with their unique official seal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/thai-ivory/index.html|publisher=Asianart.com|author=Daniel Stiles|title=Ivory Carving in Thailand|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n\nIn Southeast Asian countries, where Muslim Malay peoples live, such as [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]], ivory was the material of choice for making the handles of [[kris]] daggers. \nIn the Philippines, ivory was also used to craft the faces and hands of Catholic icons and images of saints prevalent in the [[Santo (art)|Santero]] culture.\n\nTooth and tusk ivory can be carved into a vast variety of shapes and objects. Examples of modern carved ivory objects are [[okimono]], [[netsuke]]s, jewelry, flatware handles, furniture inlays, and piano keys. Additionally, [[warthog]] tusks, and teeth from [[sperm whale]]s, [[orca]]s and hippos can also be scrimshawed or superficially carved, thus retaining their morphologically recognizable shapes.\n\nIvory usage in the last thirty years has moved towards mass production of souvenirs and jewelry. In Japan, the increase in wealth sparked consumption of solid ivory ''[[Hanko (stamp)|hanko]]'' \u2013 name seals \u2013 which before this time had been made of wood. These ''hanko'' can be carved out in a matter of seconds using machinery and were partly responsible for massive African elephant decline in the 1980s, when the African elephant population went from 1.3 million to around 600,000 in ten years.<ref name=\"To Save\"/><ref name=\"A System\">EIA (1989).

In the ten years preceding a decision in 1989 by [[CITES]] to ban international trade in African elephant ivory, the population of African elephants declined from 1.3 million to around 600,000. It was found by investigators from the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]] (EIA) that CITES sales of stockpiles from Singapore and Burundi (270 tonnes and 89.5 tonnes respectively) had created a system that increased the value of ivory on the international market, thus rewarding international smugglers and giving them the ability to control the trade and continue smuggling new ivory.<ref name=\"To Save\"/><ref name=\"A System\"/>\n\nSince the ivory ban, some [[Southern Africa]]n countries have claimed their elephant populations are stable or increasing, and argued that ivory sales would support their conservation efforts. Other African countries oppose this position, stating that renewed ivory trading puts their own elephant populations under greater threat from [[poacher]]s reacting to demand. CITES allowed the sale of 49 tonnes of ivory from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana in 1997 to Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/Elephant_Related_Trade_Timeline.pdf|title=HSI Ivory trade timeline|publisher=Hsi.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref><ref>\"Living Proof\", Dave Currey & Helen Moore, A report by Environmental Investigation Agency Sept 1994</ref>\n\nIn 2007, under pressure from the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]], [[eBay]] banned all international sales of elephant-ivory products. The decision came after several mass slaughters of African elephants, most notably the [[2006 Zakouma elephant slaughter]] in [[Chad]]. The IFAW found that up to 90% of the elephant-ivory transactions on eBay violated their own wildlife policies and could potentially be illegal. In October 2008, eBay expanded the ban, disallowing any sales of ivory on eBay.\n\nA more recent sale in 2008 of 108 tonnes from the three countries and South Africa took place to Japan and China.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Economist |title=Campaigners fear for elephants and their own credibility |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/11751304}}</ref><ref>CITES summary record of Standing Committee 57 2008</ref> The inclusion of China as an \"approved\" importing country created enormous controversy, despite being supported by CITES, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Traffic (conservation programme)|Traffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/home/2008/10/28/first-ivory-auction-from-southern-africa-takes-place.html|title=Ivory sales|publisher=Traffic|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref> They argued that China had controls in place and the sale might depress prices.

The [[African elephant]] was placed on Appendix I in January 1990.

Chinese craftsmen carved ivory to make everything from images of deities to the pipe stems and end pieces of [[opium pipes]].<ref>Martin, S. (2007). ''The Art of Opium Antiques''. Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai</ref>\n\nThe Buddhist cultures of [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], traditionally harvested ivory from their domesticated elephants. Ivory was prized for containers due to its ability to keep an airtight seal. It was also commonly carved into elaborate seals utilized by officials to \"sign\" documents and decrees by stamping them with their unique official seal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/thai-ivory/index.html|publisher=Asianart.com|author=Daniel Stiles|title=Ivory Carving in Thailand|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n\nIn Southeast Asian countries, where Muslim Malay peoples live, such as [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]], ivory was the material of choice for making the handles of [[kris]] daggers. \nIn the Philippines, ivory was also used to craft the faces and hands of Catholic icons and images of saints prevalent in the [[Santo (art)|Santero]] culture.\n\nTooth and tusk ivory can be carved into a vast variety of shapes and objects. Examples of modern carved ivory objects are [[okimono]], [[netsuke]]s, jewelry, flatware handles, furniture inlays, and piano keys. Additionally, [[warthog]] tusks, and teeth from [[sperm whale]]s, [[orca]]s and hippos can also be scrimshawed or superficially carved, thus retaining their morphologically recognizable shapes.\n\nIvory usage in the last thirty years has moved towards mass production of souvenirs and jewelry. In Japan, the increase in wealth sparked consumption of solid ivory ''[[Hanko (stamp)|hanko]]'' \u2013 name seals \u2013 which before this time had been made of wood. These ''hanko'' can be carved out in a matter of seconds using machinery and were partly responsible for massive African elephant decline in the 1980s, when the African elephant population went from 1.3 million to around 600,000 in ten years.<ref name=\"To Save\"/><ref name=\"A System\">EIA (1989).

It was formerly used to make cutlery handles, [[billiard ball]]s, [[Key (instrument)|piano keys]], [[Great Highland Bagpipes|Scottish bagpipes]], buttons and a wide range of ornamental items.\n\nSynthetic substitutes for ivory in the use of most of these items have been developed since 1800: the billiard industry challenged inventors to come up with an alternative material that could be [[Manufacturing|manufactured]];<ref name=\"Shamos 19992\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>{{rp|17}} the piano industry abandoned ivory as a key covering material in the 1970s.\n\nIvory can be taken from dead animals&nbsp;\u2013 however, most ivory came from elephants that were killed for their tusks.

In the ten years preceding a decision in 1989 by [[CITES]] to ban international trade in African elephant ivory, the population of African elephants declined from 1.3 million to around 600,000. It was found by investigators from the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]] (EIA) that CITES sales of stockpiles from Singapore and Burundi (270 tonnes and 89.5 tonnes respectively) had created a system that increased the value of ivory on the international market, thus rewarding international smugglers and giving them the ability to control the trade and continue smuggling new ivory.<ref name=\"To Save\"/><ref name=\"A System\"/>\n\nSince the ivory ban, some [[Southern Africa]]n countries have claimed their elephant populations are stable or increasing, and argued that ivory sales would support their conservation efforts. Other African countries oppose this position, stating that renewed ivory trading puts their own elephant populations under greater threat from [[poacher]]s reacting to demand. CITES allowed the sale of 49 tonnes of ivory from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana in 1997 to Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/Elephant_Related_Trade_Timeline.pdf|title=HSI Ivory trade timeline|publisher=Hsi.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref><ref>\"Living Proof\", Dave Currey & Helen Moore, A report by Environmental Investigation Agency Sept 1994</ref>\n\nIn 2007, under pressure from the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]], [[eBay]] banned all international sales of elephant-ivory products. The decision came after several mass slaughters of African elephants, most notably the [[2006 Zakouma elephant slaughter]] in [[Chad]]. The IFAW found that up to 90% of the elephant-ivory transactions on eBay violated their own wildlife policies and could potentially be illegal. In October 2008, eBay expanded the ban, disallowing any sales of ivory on eBay.\n\nA more recent sale in 2008 of 108 tonnes from the three countries and South Africa took place to Japan and China.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Economist |title=Campaigners fear for elephants and their own credibility |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/11751304}}</ref><ref>CITES summary record of Standing Committee 57 2008</ref> The inclusion of China as an \"approved\" importing country created enormous controversy, despite being supported by CITES, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Traffic (conservation programme)|Traffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/home/2008/10/28/first-ivory-auction-from-southern-africa-takes-place.html|title=Ivory sales|publisher=Traffic|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref> They argued that China had controls in place and the sale might depress prices.

It is estimated that consumption in Great Britain alone in 1831 amounted to the deaths of nearly 4,000 elephants.  In 1975, the [[Asian elephant]] was placed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]), which prevents international trade between member states of species that are threatened by trade. The [[African elephant]] was placed on Appendix I in January 1990. Since then, some southern African countries have had their populations of elephants \"downlisted\" to Appendix II, allowing the domestic trade of non-ivory items; there have also been two \"one off\" sales of ivory stockpiles.<ref name=\"To Save\">\"To Save An Elephant\" by Allan Thornton & [[Dave Currey (environmentalist)|Dave Currey]], Doubleday 1991 {{ISBN|0-385-40111-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/gallery/species/mammal/asianelephant.html|title=Asian Elephant|publisher=Cites.org|accessdate=2017-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600932.html|title=Increased Demand for Ivory Threatens Elephant Survival|work=Washington Post|date=2007-02-27|accessdate=2017-11-03|first=Marc|last=Kaufman}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3879214|title=Lifting the Ivory Ban Called Premature |publisher=NPR |date=2002-10-31|accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/globalmarkets/wildlifetrade/faqs-elephant.html|title=WWF Wildlife Trade \u2013 elephant ivory FAQs|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, more than a ton of [[confiscation|confiscated]] ivory was [[destruction of ivory|crushed]] in New York's Times Square by the Wildlife Conservation Society to send a message that the [[illegal trade]] will not be tolerated.
