The campaign can be divided into 3 stages: the White offensive (June 6 \u2013 July 3), trench warfare around the Kakhovka Brigdehead (August 20 \u2013 October 27) and the counterattack of the Red Army (October 28 \u2013 November 3).\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn April 4, the defeated [[Anton Denikin]] transferred the post of the commander of the AFSR to General [[Pyotr Wrangel]]. Having reformed the remnants of the AFSR into a 25,000-strong army, Wrangel gave her the name ''Russian Army''.\n\nThe operational action plan for the [[Southwestern Front (RSFSR)|South Western Front]] of the Red Army in the second half of June 1920 was as follows: \n* the [[13th Army (RSFSR)|13th Army]], located on the right bank of the Dnieper was to develop an offensive from the area Berislav in the general direction [[Kakhovka]] - [[Perekop]]. \n* [[Ivan Fedko]]'s group (30th, 46th and 15th divisions, 2nd infantry brigade and two brigades of the 23rd Infantry Division), deployed at the Sherebets-Orekhov-Pogoly front, was to strike in the direction of [[Melitopol]]. The actions of these two groups had to bind the enemy's main forces.\n\nAt this time, the mounted group under command of [[Dmitry Zhloba]], concentrated on June 27 in the area of the Husark \u2013 Popovka \u2013 Belmanka \u2013 Tsarekonstantinovka, aimed at Melitopol. The group was composed of the 1st Cavalry Corps (3800 sabers under [[Dmitry Zhloba]]), the 2nd Stavropol Cavalry Division (1340 sabers under [[Pavel Dybenko]]) and two cavalry brigades of the 40th Division (1,500 sabers).\n\n== Destruction of the Red 1st Cavalry Corps (29 June \u2013 3 July) == \n\nOn June 28, the cavalry group Zhloba breaks through the front of the Don Corps and takes Chernigovka. On the next day, they advance further in the general direction of Pragenau-Astrakhanka. At the same time, the White Army pulls large infantry forces into the area to surround the cavalry group Zhloba from the north and the south.\nThe total number of forces allocated to the encirclement of the Red cavalry reached 10,000\u201311,000.\n\nOn the dawn of July 3, the white units went on the offensive to encircle and finally eliminate the red cavalry of Zhloba. The aviation of the Russian Army also inflicted heavy losses on the Zhloba corps. On July 3, 1920, General Morozov dealt the final blow to the already smashed corps of Zhloba.\n\nAs a result of this brilliant victory, the Russian Army of Wrangel was able to seize the strategic initiative and continue the offensive against [[Yekaterinoslav]] and Southern Little Russia. The large losses of the Red Army troops forced them to retreat. The supporters of the White movement had regained the hope of winning the war.\nBy the mid-July the White Army had seized Northern Taurida.\n\n== Kakhovka Bridgehead ==\n\nTo stop the Whites, the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the RSFSR issued an order to establish the [[Southern Front (RSFSR)|Southern Front]] under the command of [[Mikhail Frunze]]. In August 1920, [[Ieronim Uborevich]] was ordered to establish a bridgehead over the [[Dnieper River]] at [[Kakhovka]].\n\nThe Kakhovka bridgehead was created on August 7, 1920, when units of the [[15th Rifle Division|15th]], [[52nd Rifle Division|52nd]] and [[Latvian Riflemen|Latvian Rifle Divisions]] of the [[13th Army (RSFSR)|13th Army]] successfully forced the Dnieper in the area of Alyoshka \u2013 Korsunsky Monastery.\nThe total area of the bridgehead was {{convert|216|km2|abbr=on}}, with a depth of {{convert|12|\u2013|15|km|abbr=on}}, and was supplied through 4 ferries at the village of Bolshaya Kakhovka. A bridgehead at a distance of {{convert|60|\u2013|70|km|abbr=on}} from [[Perekop]] posed a serious threat in the rear of the White Guard troops in Northern Taurida.\nImmediately the construction of fortifications in three defensive lines began and was completed on October 13, 1920.\n\nBetween August 12 and October 28, the Kakhovka bridgehead became the site of fierce battles, with failed attacks and counterattacks, and heavy casualties on both sides, \"probably the closest the Civil War came to world war trench fighting.\"<ref>[[Evan Mawdsley]], ''The Russian Civil War'' (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2008), p. 268.</ref>\n\nAssistance was provided to the Red Army by the actions of Red Partisans and spontaneous insurrections of the population in the rear of the White troops.\n\n== Red offensive ==\nOn October 12, 1920, a [[Polish\u2013Soviet War|truce was concluded]] between Poland and Soviet Russia. This enabled the Red Army to hastily move troops from the Polish front to Southern Ukraine. Thus, numerical superiority of the Red Army over the Russian army was created. On October 28, the Southern Front launched a counteroffensive and, by November 3, was able to defeat the White Army in Northern Taurida.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWrangel's troops retreated to the Crimea.\n\nOn November 7, Soviet troops launched a new successful offensive (the [[Perekop-Chongar operation]]).\n\nOn November 17, the White Army [[Evacuation of the Crimea (1920)|evacuated the Crimea]] and the war on the Southern Front came to an end.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* ''This is a translation of an article in the Russian Wikipedia, [[:ru:\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0422\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0422\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f]].''\n* ''This is a translation of an article in the Russian Wikipedia, [[:ru:\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b \u0416\u043b\u043e\u0431\u044b|\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b \u0416\u043b\u043e\u0431\u044b]].''\n* ''This is a translation of an article in the Russian Wikipedia, [[:ru:\u0411\u043e\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435 (1920)|\u0411\u043e\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435 (1920)]].''\n\n{{coord missing|Russia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Northern Taurida Operation}}\n[[Category:Battles of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1920]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Northern Taurida Operation\n| partof      = the [[Southern Front of the Russian Civil War|Southern Front]] of the [[Russian Civil War]]\n| image       = File:Kahovka English tank.jpg\n| image_size  = 275\n| caption     = British-made [[Mark IV tank]] used by White Army, captured by the Red Army 14 October 1920 in the Kakhovka bridgehead\n| date        = 6 June \u2013 3 November 1920\n| place       = [[Northern Taurida]], Southern Russia \n| coordinates = \n| result      = Initial White Army success, final Red Army victory\n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Army of Wrangel]]\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon|Russian SFSR|1918}} [[Red Army]]<br>{{flagicon image|Black_flag.svg}} [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]]\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Pyotr Wrangel]] \n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Russian SFSR|1918}} [[Mikhail Frunze]]<br>{{flagicon image|Black_flag.svg}} [[Nestor Makhno]]\n| strength1   = 38,000 (on 28 October) \n| strength2   = 133,100 (on 28 October)\n| casualties1 = Heavy\n| casualties2 = Heavy\n}}\n{{Southern Front of the Russian Civil War}}\nThe '''Northern Taurida operation''' (June 6 \u2013 November 3, 1920)  was a military campaign of the [[Russian Civil War]] between the Red Army and the Wrangel Russian Army for the possession of [[Northern Taurida]].

Calzaghe's father, worked several jobs as a teenager in Italy, including as a barman, a chef and a cleaner before, travelling Europe as a [[Street performance|busker]]. He eventually arrived back in Britain to visit family in [[Bournemouth]]. It was during this time that Calzaghe's parents met, his mother hailed from the mining town of [[Markham, Caerphilly]]. The couple married and briefly moved to Sardinia but returned shortly after when Calzaghe's mother became homesick. The couple settled in London, his father working two jobs in a factory and a [[bed and breakfast]] while his mother worked as a secretary in the offices of production company [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"c3033\">{{harvnb|Calzaghe|2007|pp=30\u201333}}</ref>\n\nCalzaghe was born in [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in March 1972,<ref name=\"c3033\"/> before his father decided to move the family back to Sardinia at the end of the year, living in his grandfather's home in Bancali.

He attended the local school, Pentwynmawr Primary, along with his two sisters, Melissa and Sonia, and developed a keen interest in playing football.

Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics said that he had still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat whoever was out there and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and [[Pat Lawlor]].\n\nIn November 1996, Calzaghe moved to [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]]'s stable. Warren, who had managed [[Nigel Benn]] for his first twenty fights, declared: \"Joe Calzaghe is a far better prospect, in fact he is my fighter for the new millennium.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkboxing.co.uk/guides/boxing_legends_joe_calzaghe.html |title=Joe Calzaghe \u2013 A Boxing Legend Profile |publisher=Talkboxing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> Calzaghe continued his winning ways in 1997, defeating Carlos Christie, the unbeaten [[Tyler Hughes]] and the 45\u20132 Luciano Torres. Meanwhile, Warren spent the summer of 1997 chasing a fight for Calzaghe with either [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Champion [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] or Irish [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Champion [[Steve Collins]]. The fight with Collins was arranged, but at a late stage Collins withdrew because of injury, was stripped of his title, and then retired.\n\n===WBO super-middleweight champion===\nAfter Collins retired, a fight against British boxing legend [[Chris Eubank]] was quickly set up for the vacant WBO title on 11 October 1997, in [[Sheffield]]. Calzaghe emerged victorious over the two-time WBO champion, knocking the granite chinned Eubank down in the opening seconds and claiming a unanimous points win. The judges scored the contest 118\u2013110, 118\u2013109, and 116\u2013111 in favour of Calzaghe.

Calzaghe became the first boxer to stop Gimenez Ferreyra, something which Benn, Eubank and [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] had failed to do in the past.\n\nIn 1999, Calzaghe started out by fighting his domestic rival, [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]]. Calzaghe was bitter that Reid had refused to face him whilst holding the WBC Championship in a unification bout and vowed to beat him, while Reid vowed to upset the odds by defeating Calzaghe and becoming a world champion again. After four rounds of the fight, Calzaghe seemed in total control and on his way to a comfortable victory, but then Reid won the next couple of rounds and it became a highly competitive fight thereafter with around five close rounds by the end of the fight that could have been scored either way, or even. Reid was also docked a point by the referee in the eighth round after a fifth warning for rabbit punches and low blows. It was arguably the closest that Calzaghe came to losing in his entire professional boxing career. After twelve rounds, the judges scored the fight for Calzaghe via a split decision (two judges scored it 116\u2013111 for Calzaghe, while the other judge scored it 116\u2013111 for Reid).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mostbeautifulman.com/athletes/robinreid/bio.shtml |title=Robin Reid \u2013 pictures, picture, pics, images, gallery, info, bio, gossip, shirtless, photos, videos, band, lyrics, songs |publisher=Mostbeautifulman.com |accessdate=10 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114173153/http://www.mostbeautifulman.com/athletes/robinreid/bio.shtml |archivedate=14 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Reid was never given the opportunity of a rematch.

Calzaghe's father, worked several jobs as a teenager in Italy, including as a barman, a chef and a cleaner before, travelling Europe as a [[Street performance|busker]]. He eventually arrived back in Britain to visit family in [[Bournemouth]]. It was during this time that Calzaghe's parents met, his mother hailed from the mining town of [[Markham, Caerphilly]]. The couple married and briefly moved to Sardinia but returned shortly after when Calzaghe's mother became homesick.

He attended the local school, Pentwynmawr Primary, along with his two sisters, Melissa and Sonia, and developed a keen interest in playing football.

By September 1995, Calzaghe had won thirteen out of thirteen fights, including seven in the first round and two in the second, including quickfire victories over the highly experienced American duo of Frank Minton and Robert Curry, with only the fully fledged British Light Heavyweight Bobbie Joe Edwards lasting the distance.\n\nIn October 1995, Calzaghe won the vacant [[BBBofC|British]] [[super-middleweight]] title, stopping the previously unbeaten Stephen Wilson in the eighth round.\n\nAt the end of 1995, Calzaghe was voted Young Boxer of the Year by the Professional Boxing Association and the Boxing Writers' Club, with [[Barry McGuigan]]'s top tipping Calzaghe for 1996: \"He punches ferociously, moves superbly and has the best of the European technique and US aggression.\"<ref>''[http://www.men-arena.com/about/?page_id=1176 World Championship Boxing presents Joe Calzaghe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206143409/http://www.men-arena.com/about/?page_id=1176 |date=6 December 2008 }}'' Manchester Evening News, October 2006</ref>\n\nAfter beginning 1996 with two more quick knockouts over Guy Stanford and Anthony Brooks, he successfully defended his British title with an easier-than-expected fifth round stoppage of the tough undefeated puncher [[Mark Delaney (boxer)|Mark Delaney]] (21\u20130). Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics said that he had still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat whoever was out there and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and [[Pat Lawlor]].\n\nIn November 1996, Calzaghe moved to [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]]'s stable. Warren, who had managed [[Nigel Benn]] for his first twenty fights, declared: \"Joe Calzaghe is a far better prospect, in fact he is my fighter for the new millennium.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkboxing.co.uk/guides/boxing_legends_joe_calzaghe.html |title=Joe Calzaghe \u2013 A Boxing Legend Profile |publisher=Talkboxing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> Calzaghe continued his winning ways in 1997, defeating Carlos Christie, the unbeaten [[Tyler Hughes]] and the 45\u20132 Luciano Torres. Meanwhile, Warren spent the summer of 1997 chasing a fight for Calzaghe with either [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Champion [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] or Irish [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Champion [[Steve Collins]]. The fight with Collins was arranged, but at a late stage Collins withdrew because of injury, was stripped of his title, and then retired.\n\n===WBO super-middleweight champion===\nAfter Collins retired, a fight against British boxing legend [[Chris Eubank]] was quickly set up for the vacant WBO title on 11 October 1997, in [[Sheffield]]. Calzaghe emerged victorious over the two-time WBO champion, knocking the granite chinned Eubank down in the opening seconds and claiming a unanimous points win. The judges scored the contest 118\u2013110, 118\u2013109, and 116\u2013111 in favour of Calzaghe.

Calzaghe became the first boxer to stop Gimenez Ferreyra, something which Benn, Eubank and [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] had failed to do in the past.\n\nIn 1999, Calzaghe started out by fighting his domestic rival, [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]]. Calzaghe was bitter that Reid had refused to face him whilst holding the WBC Championship in a unification bout and vowed to beat him, while Reid vowed to upset the odds by defeating Calzaghe and becoming a world champion again. After four rounds of the fight, Calzaghe seemed in total control and on his way to a comfortable victory, but then Reid won the next couple of rounds and it became a highly competitive fight thereafter with around five close rounds by the end of the fight that could have been scored either way, or even. Reid was also docked a point by the referee in the eighth round after a fifth warning for rabbit punches and low blows. It was arguably the closest that Calzaghe came to losing in his entire professional boxing career. After twelve rounds, the judges scored the fight for Calzaghe via a split decision (two judges scored it 116\u2013111 for Calzaghe, while the other judge scored it 116\u2013111 for Reid).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mostbeautifulman.com/athletes/robinreid/bio.shtml |title=Robin Reid \u2013 pictures, picture, pics, images, gallery, info, bio, gossip, shirtless, photos, videos, band, lyrics, songs |publisher=Mostbeautifulman.com |accessdate=10 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114173153/http://www.mostbeautifulman.com/athletes/robinreid/bio.shtml |archivedate=14 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Reid was never given the opportunity of a rematch.

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

Nonetheless, they mostly portray the same environment depicted in the original ''Berenstain Bears'' storybooks quite accurately and concentrate on the messages and lessons learned by the family through their different experiences, such as generousity and responsibility, as well as the daily lives of the bears.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Berenstain Bears (2003 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of The Berenstain Bears (2003 TV series) episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Michael Cera]] as Brother Bear (Episodes 1-26)\n*[[Michael D'Ascenzo]] as Brother Bear (Episodes 27-40)\n*[[Tajja Isen]] as Sister Bear\n*[[Benedict Campbell]] as Papa Q.

(This issue also occurred in the previous animated series and specials. Only a limited amount of polka dots was allowed in the five specials.)<ref name=\"gillies\"/> The show's theme song is performed by [[Lee Ann Womack]].<ref name=gillies/> The series is supposed to supplement the 1985 series because new books were released since then, even though the two series have a radically different production style as well as a change of in-universe elements.
