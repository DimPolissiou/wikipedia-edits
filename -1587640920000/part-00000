Established in 1882, the club played in the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]], [[Lancashire Combination]] and [[Central League (football)|Central League]] before becoming founder members of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1921. They were Division Three North champions in [[1922\u201323 Football League|1922\u201323]] and were promoted to Division Two. However, they were relegated back to the Third Division North after a single season.\n\nIn 1931 the club lost their Football League status and dropped back into the Lancashire Combination, where they played until folding in 1936. They were reformed after [[World War II]] and rejoined the Lancashire Combination, playing in the league until it merged to form the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] in 1982. They dropped out of the league between 1988 and 1992, playing in the [[West Lancashire Football League|West Lancashire League]]. Although the club left the league again in 2010, they returned the following year, and are currently members of the {{English football updater|Nelson}}, playing home matches at Victoria Park.\n\n==History==\n===Early years: 1882 to 1921===\nOn 21 October 1882, members of [[Nelson Cricket Club]] travelled to [[Burnley]] to watch a football match between the recently formed [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley Football Club]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers']] second team. The match, played at Burnley's Calder Vale ground, ended with Blackburn winning 10\u20130 and inspired the cricketers to form a football club of their own. A meeting was held on the following Monday 23 October at the Victoria Hall on Scotland Road; John Greenwood presided over the meeting and enrolled around 25 members to the newly formed Nelson Football Club.<ref name=\"Burnley Express & Advertiser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000282/18821028/003/0003?browse=true|title=A Football Club For Nelson|publisher=Burnley Express & Advertiser|date=28 October 1882|page=3| accessdate = 7 January 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nwcfl.com/clubpage.php?id=35 Nelson: History] North West Counties League</ref>\n\nNelson were founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in the 1889\u201390 season, finishing in 4th place. They were Lancashire League champions in 1895\u201396, winning 22 out of 30 games, scoring 105 goals, and runners-up two seasons later in 1897\u201398. However, the club folded during the 1898\u201399 season and their record for that season expunged when they were expelled by the Lancashire FA. They rejoined the Lancashire League in the 1900\u201301 season, finishing 6th. In 1901\u201302 they joined the [[Lancashire Combination]]. In 1903\u201304 the league expanded with two divisions, and Nelson played in Division One. However, after finishing 18th in 1906\u201307 they were relegated to Division Two, where they stayed for just one season before being promoted back to Division One. The club closed down in 1916, when bailiffs were called in they remained closed during [[World War I]] until they reformed in 1918 joining the [[Central League (football)|Central League]] in 1919\u201320 where they stayed for just two seasons.<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fchd.info/NELSON.HTM|title=Nelson|publisher=Football Club History Database|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref><ref name=\"NFC20466\">{{cite news| title = Nelson FC: 1881\u20131921| url = http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=ED21&id=20466| date = 19 March 2005| publisher = Nelson F.C.| accessdate = 2009-01-12| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130421061306/http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=ED21&id=20466| archivedate = 21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Football League years: 1921 to 1931===\nIn 1921, the club joined [[the Football League]] as a founder member of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]].<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\"/><ref name=\"PP-nelson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/html/nelson.html|title=Nelson FC|publisher=Pyramid Passion|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref> Their first league game, a 2\u20131 defeat to the now-defunct [[Wigan Borough F.C.|Wigan Borough]] attracted a record attendance of 9,000 on 27 August 1921.

That season they finished 5th, however the club then started to struggle in the league and finished in last place in 1927\u201328, conceding 135 goals, and they were also struggling financially and found themselves \u00a36,500 in debt. They were though re-elected to the league. In 1930\u201331 they reached the second round of the FA Cup for a second time. In the first round they beat [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]] 4\u20130 then lost 2\u20131 to [[York City F.C.|York City]] in a replay after a 1\u20131 draw. However, they again struggled in the league, dropping to last place on [[Boxing Day]] 1930, where they stayed for the rest of the season. After finishing bottom of the league for a second time, they failed to win [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] and were voted out of the Football League after a second vote, following a tie. They were replaced by [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]. The club's last game in the Football League was a 4\u20130 defeat to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 2 May 1931.

After completing two seasons in local football the club announced after their final game at Gargrave in 1939 that the following season would see them return to senior football in the West Lancashire League. Sadly only two games were played before events in Europe dictated a seven-year absence of League football in Nelson.\n\n===Post-Second World War: 1946 to 1982===\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], the club was reformed in 1946, and immediately rejoined the Lancashire Combination finishing 11th in 1946\u201347. The following season they were runners-up and for the next few seasons the club continued to do well both in the Lancashire Combination and cup competitions. A 4th-placed finish in 1947\u201348 was followed by the club being crowned champions in 1949\u201350, scoring 125 league goals, when they also won the Lancashire Combination Cup. They were runners-up in 1950\u201351, when they lost out on the title on goal-average, while scoring 120 goals. Also in 1950\u201351, Nelson won the Lancashire Combination Cup again and reached the second round of the FA Cup. Although the first time the club did so a non-league club, meaning they started the competition in the first qualifying round where they beat [[Lancaster City F.C.|Lancaster City]] 5\u20132. They then beat Leyland Motors 4\u20131 in the second qualifying round, followed by victories over [[Bacup Borough F.C.|Bacup Borough]] (2\u20130 in the third qualifying round) and [[Hyde United F.C.|Hyde United]] (3\u20130 in a replay in the fourth qualifying round). In the first round they beat [[Witton Albion F.C.|Witton Albion]] 1\u20130 before losing 3\u20132 to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in the second round. In 1951\u201352 they were champions for a second time, this time scoring 139 goals with [[Joe Fagan]], who went on to manage [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], as manager. A 5th-place finish in 1952\u201353, Fagan's second and final season in charge, was followed by a 3rd place in 1953\u201354.<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\"/><ref name=\"PP-nelson\"/> However, despite finishing as champions twice, each time they applied to re-join the Football League they narrowly failed. In 1954\u201355 they won the [[Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy]]. They won the Lancashire Combination Cup for a third time in 1959\u201360. In 1960\u201361 they were runners-up in the Combination, the closest the club came to winning the title again. However, in 1965\u201366 they finished 21st (out of 22) and were relegated to Division Two. The Lancashire Combination lost many of its clubs to the newly formed [[Northern Premier League]] in 1968. However, Nelson remained in the Combination. In their final season in the Combination, 1981\u201382, they finished 3rd.<ref name=\"NFC220500\"/>\n\n===Modern era: 1983 to present===\nNelson became founder members of the new North West Counties Football League, joining the Third Division. They finished 10th (out of 18) in their first season, 1982\u201383. The 1986\u201387 season saw a 4th-placed finish. The following season the Third Division was scrapped, and Nelson were moved up to the Second Division, finishing in 16th. However, due to the poor state of their Victoria Park stadium, and problems with getting it up to the standard required by the league, the club were forced to drop down to the [[West Lancashire League]], where they played in the Second Division and remained for four seasons from 1988\u201389 to 1991\u201392. They struggled though with a highest place finish of 15th. They were re-admitted to the North West Counties Second Division for the 1992\u201393 season after Victoria Park was upgraded, although they finished 17th (out of 18) in their first season. In 1996\u201397 they won the Division Two Trophy. In 1999\u20132000 they finished 3rd. In 2000\u201301 they finished in the third and final promotion place on the final day of the season above [[Atherton Laburnum Rovers F.C.|Atherton Laburnum Rovers]]. However, Atherton were granted a replay of their final game as their opponents had fielded an ineligible player. Atherton won the replayed game to snatch away third spot from Nelson. In 2005\u201306 they again finished 3rd and were promoted to the [[North West Counties Football League Premier Division|First Division]], the club's first promotion in 83 years.<ref name=\"NFC224548\">{{cite news| title = Nelson FC: 1982\u20132006| url = http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=ED21&id=224548| date = 5 June 2006| publisher = Nelson F.C.| accessdate = 2009-01-12| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707010104/http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=ED21&id=224548| archivedate = 7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThey finished 20th (out of 22) in 2006\u201307 and 20th (out of 20) in 2007\u201308 although they were not relegated. In 2008\u201309 the First Division was renamed the Premier Division; Nelson finished in 17th position out of 22 despite winning just three home games, The Blues fared much better on the road to finish 16 points clear of bottom club Atherton Collieries.<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\"/><ref name=\"PP-nelson\"/> On 15 July 2010, the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] announced that Nelson had resigned from the league with immediate effect. Nelson F.C. continued to operate junior teams, however, and made an application to rejoin the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] for the 2011\u201312 season, which was later approved by the FA.<ref>[http://www.vodkatleague.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1299&cntnt01returnid=51 Applications to join our league \u2013 NWCFL website]</ref>\nMark Fell was appointed 1st team manager in November 2012 after Michael Morrison and Robert Grimes were sacked. Fell led the side to 10th in the NWCFL. In Fell's first full season in charge, Nelson were crowned champions of the NWCFL Division One, being promoted to the Premier Division in the process.\n\n==Ground==\n===Seedhill===\nNelson originally played its home matches on a pitch behind the Golden Ball [[public house|pub]] moving to the Park Ground by the 1890s.<ref>\"''Wigan County paid their visit to Park Ground, Nelson. on Saturday afternoon\".'' Wigan Examiner 23 March 1898 page 4, column 2</ref> They moved to [[Seedhill Football Ground|Seedhill]] around 1905 where the club had a small wooden stand and a small covered enclosure behind one goal, with grass banking around the rest of the ground. In 1922 a large 2,000 capacity wooden stand was built. The club's highest attendance at the stadium was 14,143 for a [[Third Division North]] match at home [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]] on 10 April 1926.<ref name=\"NFC-honours\"/>\n\nNelson played their final home game at Seedhill on Sunday 28 March 1971 when a crowd of over a thousand gathered to witness the first Sunday fixture at the stadium. They were duly rewarded with an eight-goal thriller as Clitheroe were beaten 5\u20133. Seedhill, having hosted the Nelson Admirals speedway team between 1967 and 1969, latterly became a well known stock car venue before its eventual demolition around 1980 when the M65 motorway cut through the area. The site of Seedhill remains clearly visible today.\n\n===Victoria Park===\nNelson moved to Victoria Park (known locally as \"Little Wembley\") in time for their opening home fixture of the following 1971\u201372 Lancashire Combination season, when the Nelson Leader reported a \"good crowd\" attended to see them lose 1\u20130 to the recently reformed Accrington Stanley on 28 August 1971. Victoria Park now has a capacity of 2,000, with 1,700 standing. It is bordered by trees on two sides in surrounding parkland.

Established in 1882, the club played in the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]], [[Lancashire Combination]] and [[Central League (football)|Central League]] before becoming founder members of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1921. They were Division Three North champions in [[1922\u201323 Football League|1922\u201323]] and were promoted to Division Two. However, they were relegated back to the Third Division North after a single season.\n\nIn 1931 the club lost their Football League status and dropped back into the Lancashire Combination, where they played until folding in 1936. They were reformed after [[World War II]] and rejoined the Lancashire Combination, playing in the league until it merged to form the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] in 1982. They dropped out of the league between 1988 and 1992, playing in the [[West Lancashire Football League|West Lancashire League]]. Although the club left the league again in 2010, they returned the following year, and are currently members of the {{English football updater|Nelson}}, playing home matches at Victoria Park.\n\n==History==\n===Early years: 1882 to 1921===\nOn 21 October 1882, members of [[Nelson Cricket Club]] travelled to [[Burnley]] to watch a football match between the recently formed [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley Football Club]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers']] second team. The match, played at Burnley's Calder Vale ground, ended with Blackburn winning 10\u20130 and inspired the cricketers to form a football club of their own. A meeting was held on the following Monday 23 October at the Victoria Hall on Scotland Road; John Greenwood presided over the meeting and enrolled around 25 members to the newly formed Nelson Football Club.<ref name=\"Burnley Express & Advertiser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000282/18821028/003/0003?browse=true|title=A Football Club For Nelson|publisher=Burnley Express & Advertiser|date=28 October 1882|page=3| accessdate = 7 January 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nwcfl.com/clubpage.php?id=35 Nelson: History] North West Counties League</ref>\n\nNelson were founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in the 1889\u201390 season, finishing in 4th place. They were Lancashire League champions in 1895\u201396, winning 22 out of 30 games, scoring 105 goals, and runners-up two seasons later in 1897\u201398. However, the club folded during the 1898\u201399 season and their record for that season expunged when they were expelled by the Lancashire FA. They rejoined the Lancashire League in the 1900\u201301 season, finishing 6th. In 1901\u201302 they joined the [[Lancashire Combination]]. In 1903\u201304 the league expanded with two divisions, and Nelson played in Division One. However, after finishing 18th in 1906\u201307 they were relegated to Division Two, where they stayed for just one season before being promoted back to Division One. The club closed down in 1916, when bailiffs were called in they remained closed during [[World War I]] until they reformed in 1918 joining the [[Central League (football)|Central League]] in 1919\u201320 where they stayed for just two seasons.<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fchd.info/NELSON.HTM|title=Nelson|publisher=Football Club History Database|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref><ref name=\"NFC20466\">{{cite news| title = Nelson FC: 1881\u20131921| url = http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=ED21&id=20466| date = 19 March 2005| publisher = Nelson F.C.| accessdate = 2009-01-12| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130421061306/http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=ED21&id=20466| archivedate = 21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Football League years: 1921 to 1931===\nIn 1921, the club joined [[the Football League]] as a founder member of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]].<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\"/><ref name=\"PP-nelson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/html/nelson.html|title=Nelson FC|publisher=Pyramid Passion|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref> Their first league game, a 2\u20131 defeat to the now-defunct [[Wigan Borough F.C.|Wigan Borough]] attracted a record attendance of 9,000 on 27 August 1921.

That season they finished 5th, however the club then started to struggle in the league and finished in last place in 1927\u201328, conceding 135 goals, and they were also struggling financially and found themselves \u00a36,500 in debt. They were though re-elected to the league. In 1930\u201331 they reached the second round of the FA Cup for a second time.

After completing two seasons in local football the club announced after their final game at Gargrave in 1939 that the following season would see them return to senior football in the West Lancashire League. Sadly only two games were played before events in Europe dictated a seven-year absence of League football in Nelson.\n\n===Post-Second World War: 1946 to 1982===\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], the club was reformed in 1946, and immediately rejoined the Lancashire Combination finishing 11th in 1946\u201347. The following season they were runners-up and for the next few seasons the club continued to do well both in the Lancashire Combination and cup competitions. A 4th-placed finish in 1947\u201348 was followed by the club being crowned champions in 1949\u201350, scoring 125 league goals, when they also won the Lancashire Combination Cup. They were runners-up in 1950\u201351, when they lost out on the title on goal-average, while scoring 120 goals. Also in 1950\u201351, Nelson won the Lancashire Combination Cup again and reached the second round of the FA Cup. Although the first time the club did so a non-league club, meaning they started the competition in the first qualifying round where they beat [[Lancaster City F.C.|Lancaster City]] 5\u20132. They then beat Leyland Motors 4\u20131 in the second qualifying round, followed by victories over [[Bacup Borough F.C.|Bacup Borough]] (2\u20130 in the third qualifying round) and [[Hyde United F.C.|Hyde United]] (3\u20130 in a replay in the fourth qualifying round). In the first round they beat [[Witton Albion F.C.|Witton Albion]] 1\u20130 before losing 3\u20132 to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in the second round. In 1951\u201352 they were champions for a second time, this time scoring 139 goals with [[Joe Fagan]], who went on to manage [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], as manager. A 5th-place finish in 1952\u201353, Fagan's second and final season in charge, was followed by a 3rd place in 1953\u201354.<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\"/><ref name=\"PP-nelson\"/> However, despite finishing as champions twice, each time they applied to re-join the Football League they narrowly failed. In 1954\u201355 they won the [[Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy]]. They won the Lancashire Combination Cup for a third time in 1959\u201360. In 1960\u201361 they were runners-up in the Combination, the closest the club came to winning the title again. However, in 1965\u201366 they finished 21st (out of 22) and were relegated to Division Two. The Lancashire Combination lost many of its clubs to the newly formed [[Northern Premier League]] in 1968. However, Nelson remained in the Combination. In their final season in the Combination, 1981\u201382, they finished 3rd.<ref name=\"NFC220500\"/>\n\n===Modern era: 1983 to present===\nNelson became founder members of the new North West Counties Football League, joining the Third Division. They finished 10th (out of 18) in their first season, 1982\u201383. The 1986\u201387 season saw a 4th-placed finish. The following season the Third Division was scrapped, and Nelson were moved up to the Second Division, finishing in 16th. However, due to the poor state of their Victoria Park stadium, and problems with getting it up to the standard required by the league, the club were forced to drop down to the [[West Lancashire League]], where they played in the Second Division and remained for four seasons from 1988\u201389 to 1991\u201392. They struggled though with a highest place finish of 15th. They were re-admitted to the North West Counties Second Division for the 1992\u201393 season after Victoria Park was upgraded, although they finished 17th (out of 18) in their first season. In 1996\u201397 they won the Division Two Trophy. In 1999\u20132000 they finished 3rd. In 2000\u201301 they finished in the third and final promotion place on the final day of the season above [[Atherton Laburnum Rovers F.C.|Atherton Laburnum Rovers]]. However, Atherton were granted a replay of their final game as their opponents had fielded an ineligible player. Atherton won the replayed game to snatch away third spot from Nelson.

In 2008\u201309 the First Division was renamed the Premier Division; Nelson finished in 17th position out of 22 despite winning just three home games, The Blues fared much better on the road to finish 16 points clear of bottom club Atherton Collieries.<ref name=\"fchd-nelson\"/><ref name=\"PP-nelson\"/> On 15 July 2010, the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] announced that Nelson had resigned from the league with immediate effect.

Wigan Examiner 23 March 1898 page 4, column 2</ref> They moved to [[Seedhill Football Ground|Seedhill]] around 1905 where the club had a small wooden stand and a small covered enclosure behind one goal, with grass banking around the rest of the ground. In 1922 a large 2,000 capacity wooden stand was built. The club's highest attendance at the stadium was 14,143 for a [[Third Division North]] match at home [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]] on 10 April 1926.<ref name=\"NFC-honours\"/>\n\nNelson played their final home game at Seedhill on Sunday 28 March 1971 when a crowd of over a thousand gathered to witness the first Sunday fixture at the stadium. They were duly rewarded with an eight-goal thriller as Clitheroe were beaten 5\u20133. Seedhill, having hosted the Nelson Admirals speedway team between 1967 and 1969, latterly became a well known stock car venue before its eventual demolition around 1980 when the M65 motorway cut through the area. The site of Seedhill remains clearly visible today.\n\n===Victoria Park===\nNelson moved to Victoria Park (known locally as \"Little Wembley\") in time for their opening home fixture of the following 1971\u201372 Lancashire Combination season, when the Nelson Leader reported a \"good crowd\" attended to see them lose 1\u20130 to the recently reformed Accrington Stanley on 28 August 1971. Victoria Park now has a capacity of 2,000, with 1,700 standing. It is bordered by trees on two sides in surrounding parkland. Along one side there is a low-roofed wooden stand with seating in the centre section. The side opposite has the dugouts with a grass area.

In later years, the term Hardal became a group that actually started separating itself from the broader religious Zionist community in order to dedicate itself to leading a life dedicated to strict Jewish practice, without the influence of outside culture. There was emphasis placed on modesty in dress, and early marriage. [[Shlomo Aviner]] was a major ideologue for this group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn recent years, it refers to those under the influence of [[Zvi Thau]], who left Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav to found the more ''Hardalic'' [[Har Hamor|Yeshivat Har Hamor]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} Thau rejects secular studies and secular influences. He is also against any academic influence on teachers colleges, rejecting the influence of modern educational psychology, and modern approaches to the study of the Bible. Those who follow this approach are called followers of ''Yeshivat HaKav'' - \"''Yeshivot'' that follow the line\".\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nSeveral characteristics differentiate Hardalim from both the Haredi and the mainstream Modern Orthodox religious Zionist world:\n\n[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Hardalim might use the modern Hebrew/Sephardic pronunciation of the Hebrew language when praying, as modern Orthodox religious Zionists also do; this in contrast to Ashkenazi Haredim, who continue their tradition of using the Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew.\n\nNotable is the absence of [[Yiddish]] in Hardal society and speech.\n\nMany Hardali families have chosen not to own a television, and are not consumers of the general popular culture, in contrast to Modern Orthodox religious Zionists.\n\nHardalim typically dress like most Modern Orthodox religious Zionists would, but place a slightly larger emphasis on appearing neat, wearing their ''[[tzitzit]]'' out of their pants, and wearing a significantly larger [[kippah]]. Like other religious Zionists, they usually wear colored knitted kippahs. In contrast to Haredim, many Hardalim do not wear only white shirts or a black outfit, and only a handful of Hardalim wear a jacket and a hat; these are usually only worn by the highest levels of rabbinic leadership of the Hardal world.\n\nHardalim see the return to the land and its building as a very important ''[[mitzvah]]'', since they believe we are in the dawn of the [[Messianic Age]]. Therefore, hiking in the land, building settlements, and knowledge of its flora and fauna are considered as ''mitzvot''.\n\nMost Hardalim say prayers for the State of Israel, mark the Israeli Independence Day, and Hardali men serve in the Israel Defense Forces, while most Haredim do not. An exception forms the small group of extreme right-wing Hardalim who firmly oppose the current State of Israel and want it dismantled, to subsequently replace it with a Torah-based theocracy.\n\nHardalim fiercely opposed Israel's mass expulsion of Jews from the [[Gaza Strip]] and northern Samaria in 2005. While some Haredim also opposed the retreat and destruction of the Jewish communities, the Haredi rabbis did not condone active opposition; most (with the notable exception of [[Chabad Lubavitch]]) adopted a neutral, passively resisting, or even supportive attitude.\n\nHardalim will usually respect the ''[[Da'as Torah]]'' of a personal rabbi, but are not as dependent as Haredim, who publicly and privately strictly adhere to the advice of their rabbinical leadership. In contrast, Modern Orthodox religious Zionists might have a personal rabbi, but are usually more independent.\n\nUnlike their Modern Orthodox counterparts, Hardali men often grow ''[[payot]]'' (sidelocks), and an untrimmed beard.\n\nHardali women usually dress in clothing styles that are banned from the Haredi world for reasons of [[tzniut]], such as shirts with texts on them (for example, against the expulsion of Jews from Gaza settlements in 2005), and bare feet in sandals.\n\n==Internal divisions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nHardalim have in common the belief, most identified with Abraham Isaac Kook, that the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and the state of Israel play a central role in the Messianic process. This belief is tested when the state takes steps that seem to undermine the Messianic process, particularly removing Jewish residents from settlements, and transferring the parts of [[Land of Israel]] to non-Jewish control. Hardalim variously lean towards one of two general approaches to this conflict.\n* One approach resists compromising on Jewish control of the Land of Israel, even when this means conflict with the state of Israel. Thus, Hardalim comprised many of the most forceful opponents of anti-[[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement]] movement in the 2000s, and continue to actively oppose the removal of small settlements unauthorized by the government. Generally, this opposition is passive and verbal, but in rare cases, it has gone as far as vandalism of Israeli army property or stone-throwing at soldiers.\n* A second approach, the \"statist\" approach, is more willing to accept the government's policy decisions and the \"will of the Jewish people\", even when it seems to conflict with other religious priorities. This group sees the State of Israel as an \"entity of holiness\" whose decisions have intrinsic value even when in tension with other religious values. This stream is identified with [[Yeshivat Har Hamor]], which split off in 1997 from the flagship Hardali yeshiva Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav due to these and other theological differences.\n\nThe term ''statist'' also refers to many more moderate religious Zionists, who are willing to accept the \"will of the Jewish people\" as a consideration when it comes to many other issues, such as the secular nature of society. This latter group predates the Hardal movement by decades, and is identified much more with the mainstream Religious Zionist movement than with the Hardalim.\n\n==Schools==\nThere are schools for both boys and girls located in Jerusalem, as well as in [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]] (Ahavat Yisrael). Their philosophy is \"To adhere to an open Haredi approach to [[Halakha]] and lifestyle, while at the same time leaving the possibility for army service and university studies as a goal\".<ref>https://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/community-a-housing/community-guide-beta-listings/12279-rappaport-boys-ramot-jerusalem.html</ref>\n\n==Locations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nMany Hardalim live in West Bank settlements. The settlement town of [[Kiryat Arba]], led by its [[Dov Lior]], is considered a Hardal stronghold, as is the town of [[Beit El]], led by Rabbi Melamed and [[Shlomo Aviner]]. Hardalim are also predominant in many other settlements, including [[Yitzhar]], [[Bat Ayin]], [[Ofra]], [[Shilo (town)|Shilo]], and the Jewish parts of [[Hebron]]. There are ''yeshivot'' in [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Yerucham]] that are seen as Hardal yeshivot.

In later years, the term Hardal became a group that actually started separating itself from the broader religious Zionist community in order to dedicate itself to leading a life dedicated to strict Jewish practice, without the influence of outside culture. There was emphasis placed on modesty in dress, and early marriage. [[Shlomo Aviner]] was a major ideologue for this group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn recent years, it refers to those under the influence of [[Zvi Thau]], who left Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav to found the more ''Hardalic'' [[Har Hamor|Yeshivat Har Hamor]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} Thau rejects secular studies and secular influences.
