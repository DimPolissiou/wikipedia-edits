The team lost to the [[United States national rugby league team|USA]] and [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]], but they won their last match against the Tournament co-hosts [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] creating history for the sport of [[rugby league]] in the [[Cook Islands]]. As part of the World Cup qualification process the Cook Islands beat Samoa in a play-off to enter the Pacific Cup in 2009. The Cook Islands then went on to beat Fiji 24-22 in the Semi Final and were then beaten by Papua New Guinea in the Final. In 2016 Fairleigh took time off from coaching NRL football to give back to grassroots football. In October 2016 he was announced and unveiled as the North Queensland Cowboys new assistant coach.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Alan Whiticker|Whiticker, Alan]] & Hudson, Glen (2006) ''The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players'', Gavin Allen Publishing, Sydney\n* ''Big League's 25 Years of Origin Collectors' Edition'', News Magazines, Surry Hills, Sydney\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=10&num=15290 Saints Heritage Society profile]\n\n{{St Helens - 2001 World Club Challenge winners}}\n{{St. Helens - 2001 Challenge Cup Final winners}}\n{{1994 Kangaroo Tour squad}}\n{{Cook Islands squad 2013 Rugby League World Cup}}\n{{Rothmans Medallists}}\n{{2001 Super League Dream Team}}\n{{North Sydney Bears Team of the 21st Century}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairleigh, David}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league players]]\n[[Category:North Sydney Bears players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players]]\n[[Category:Australia national rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:Newcastle Knights players]]\n[[Category:St Helens R.F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league coaches]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Cook Islands national rugby league team coaches]]\n[[Category:New Zealand Warriors coaches]]\n[[Category:Rugby league second-rows]]\n[[Category:Rugby league props]]\n", "name_user": "DFAIRCLOUD", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fairleigh"}

Thomas Corrigan owned a retail grocery and liquor business in Newark, and the family's well-to-do status allowed Michael to pursue his educational interests. He attended [[St. Mary's College (Delaware)|St. Mary's College]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], from 1853\u20131855, [[Mount Saint Mary's University]] in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]] from 1855\u20131857, spent a year in Europe, and received his bachelor's degree from Mount Saint Mary's in 1859. He became a member of the first class at the [[Pontifical North American College|North American College]] in Rome, was ordained to the priesthood in September 1863 at the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|Basilica of St. John Lateran]], and received a doctorate of divinity in 1864.<ref name=Mooney>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04395a.htm Mooney, Joseph. \"Michael Augustine Corrigan.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 October 2015</ref>\n\nCorrigan returned to New Jersey in 1864, where he joined the faculty at [[Seton Hall College]] and the Immaculate Conception Seminary, both in [[South Orange]], as professor of theology and history. He soon achieved a reputation within the hierarchy for sound scholarship, and he also provided pastoral care to Catholics in the Seton Hall vicinity. When [[Bernard J. McQuaid]] left Seton Hall in 1869 to assume his duties as bishop of the [[Diocese of Rochester]], Corrigan succeeded him as college president and also became vicar general of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark|Diocese of Newark]].<ref name=Mooney/>\n\n==Bishop of Newark==\n[[Image:Michael Corrigan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Michael Corrigan]]\nCorrigan succeeded [[James Roosevelt Bayley]] as bishop of Newark, becoming the second ordinary of the diocese. He was consecrated bishop on May 4, 1873.<ref name=Mooney/> The diocese encompassed the entire state of [[New Jersey]] during Corrigan's tenure. He administered diocesan affairs during a time of rapid population growth, Roman Catholic institutional development, immigration from Ireland and Germany, and considerable urbanization in the northern part of the state.\n\n==Archbishop of New York==\nCorrigan was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop to [[John McCloskey|John Cardinal McCloskey]] of New York on October 1, 1880,<ref name=Grace>[https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/4845/John-Ireland-and-Michael-A-Corrigan.aspx Grace CVI, Madeline. \"John Ireland and Michael A. Corrigan\", ''OSV Newsweekly'', August 28, 2009]</ref> with the [[titular see]] of Petra, and succeeded to the archbishopric on October 10, 1885, serving as archbishop until his death.\n\nCorrigan's career in New York proved controversial on a number of levels. He aligned himself closely with his former mentor, [[Bernard J. McQuaid]] and has been considered one of the leaders of the \"conservative\" movement within the American Catholic hierarchy. He proved to be a strong supporter of [[national parish]]es<ref name=Grace/> and [[Catholic school|parochial schools]], a vocal opponent of [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], [[James Gibbons]] and other bishops who advocated \"[[Americanism (heresy)#Suppression of Americanism|Americanization]]\" within the Catholic Church.  Within the American hierarchy, he was the closest supporter of Pope Leo XIII on ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]''. He also proved unpopular with many bishops for his involvement in backstage intrigue at the Vatican.\n\nWithin the [[Archdiocese of New York]] his most serious controversy involved his conflict with Father [[Edward McGlynn]].  During the 1886 mayoral campaign in [[New York City]], the outspoken McGlynn supported [[Henry George]], the candidate of the [[Central Labor Union|United Labor Party]] who proved popular with labor organizers, radicals, socialists, and Irish nationalists. Corrigan himself had been very close to [[Tammany Hall]] and ordered McGlynn to refrain from politics. McGlynn refused, continued to clash with the bishop, and ultimately was removed as pastor of St. Stephen's Church in New York. McGlynn was summoned to Rome but refused on the grounds of ill health and was excommunicated in 1887. The censure was eventually lifted in 1892. This highly public scandal took its toll on Corrigan and contributed to his poor relationships with an influential group of New York intellectual priests. His greatest accomplishment probably involved the building of a new seminary, [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie]].\n\nIn 1897, [[Edgardo Mortara]] preached in St. Patrick's Cathedral [[New York City]], but the Archbishop of New York told the Holy See that he opposed Mortara's efforts to evangelize the Jews on the grounds that such efforts might embarrass the Church in the view of the [[United States]] government.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} He also had invited [[Mother Cabrini]] to New York, but had to withdraw his invitation. By then Mother Cabrini and her missionaries had already embarked on their sea voyage to New York.\n\nCorrigan slipped and fell when inspecting the excavation of the seminary in 1902. He contracted pneumonia during his convalescence and died. He was interred in the crypt under the altar of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]].\n\n{{Ordination\n| ordained deacon by   =\n| date of diaconal ordination =\n| place of diaconal ordination =\n| ordained priest by   = \n| date of priestly ordination = 19 September 1863\n| place of priestly ordination =\n| consecrated by       = [[John McCloskey]]\n| co-consecrators      = [[John Loughlin (bishop)|John Loughlin]]\n[[William George McCloskey]] \n| date of consecration = 4 May 1873\n| place of consecration =\n| elevated by          =\n| date of elevation    =\n\n| bishop 1             = [[Winand Michael Wigger]]\n| consecration date 1  = 1881\n| bishop 2             = [[Patrick Anthony Ludden]]\n| consecration date 2  = 1887\n| bishop 3             = [[Charles Edward McDonnell]]\n| consecration date 3  = 1892\n| bishop 4             = [[Henry Gabriels]]\n| consecration date 4  = 1892\n| bishop 5             = [[Thomas Martin Aloysius Burke]]\n| consecration date 5  = 1894\n| bishop 6             = [[James Augustine McFaul]]\n| consecration date 6  = 1894\n| bishop 7             = [[John Murphy Farley]]\n| consecration date 7  = 1895\n| bishop 8             = [[James Edward Quigley]]\n| consecration date 8  = 1897\n| bishop 9             = [[John J.

The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed to the November 2020 date because of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Widow (Natasha Romanova)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

''\u00c6on Flux'' didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'\"|source=\u2014David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward.<ref name=\"HayterNov2011\" />}}\nIn February 2004, [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] acquired the film rights for [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]],<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\" /> and in April announced [[David Hayter]] as writer and director of the film, with [[Marvel Studios]]' [[Avi Arad]] producing.<ref name=\"HayterDirectWrite\" /> By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed to the November 2020 date because of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite
