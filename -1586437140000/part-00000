They were created by writer [[D. C. Fontana]]. Within the ''Star Trek'' narrative, they are native to the blue icy Class M planet Andoria (also called Andor<ref name=ProphetCards>The home planet was first referred to as \"Andoria\" in Act 1 of \"[[Prophet Motive]]\", and as \"Andor\" in Act 3 of \"[[In the Cards]]\".</ref>).

They were indicated to be a vital, important member of the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 1997 ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode \"[[In the Cards]]\", but did not gain considerable exposure until the 2001\u20132005 series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', on which they were used as recurring characters, most notably in the person of [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Thy'lek Shran|Thy'lek Shran]], a starship commander who maintained a sometimes adversarial and begrudging friendship with ''Enterprise'' Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]. The series revealed more about Andorian ships, the home world Andoria, and the culture and history of Andorians and their subspecies, the Aenar. The 2004 episode \"[[Zero Hour (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Zero Hour]]\" established that Andorians were one of the four founding members of the United Federation of Planets.<ref name=ZeroHour>{{cite episode|series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]|title=[[Zero Hour (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Zero Hour]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=May 26, 2004|season=3|number=24}}</ref>\n\n== Storyline ==\n[[File:JourneyBabel.jpg|thumb|left|Thelev, an [[Orion (Star Trek)|Orion]] assassin disguised as an Andorian, from the 1967 [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] episode \"[[Journey to Babel]]\".]]\nAndorians appeared in four episodes of The Original Series, but there was very little back story on the Andorians until Enterprise.<ref name=StarshipsCollection37>Fred Dekker, Star Trek: The Official Starships Collection, issue 37, p. 11</ref> Historically, the Andorians were rivals with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]]. In the episode \"The Andorian Incident\", the Andorian Imperial Guard appeared on a Vulcan [[monastery]] world [[The Andorian Incident|P'Jem]] to search for a spy station, destroying property in the process. Archer discovered the spy station and informed the Andorians, leading Shran (an Andorian) to become trusting of Archer. Also in this episode, Andorians begin to refer to humans using the [[pejorative]] \"pink-skin.\"\n\nThe tensions between Andor and Vulcan were gradually resolved with human aid. Archer settles a conflict between the Vulcans and Andorians over the territory of a planet in the episode \"Cease Fire\".\n\nIn the third season of Enterprise, Shran offers Archer assistance in retrieving a prototype of the Xindi weapon, only to be betrayed by Shran when he takes the weapon. Archer believes Shran would use the weapon against the Vulcans, so he remotely set the detonation sequence to prevent them from using it. Shran released the weapon from his ship before it exploded. In the season 3 finale, Shran helped Archer fight the Xindi reptilians who were bringing the final weapon to Earth. Shran's involvement with the Xindi weapon leads to a brief armed conflict between Vulcans and Andorians in the fourth season episode \"Kir'Shara\". A Vulcan leader named V'Lass believes the Andorians are designing a new weapon from their scans of the Xindi weapon. \n\nIn the episode \"United\", an Andorian dies from a phaser wound, leading Shran to challenge a Tellarite to the Ushaan. In Andorian tradition, the Ushaan is a duel to the death, which is fought with hand-held ice-cutting blades called Ushaan-Tor, as mentioned in the second scene of Act 3. The Ushaan Right of Substitution allows combatants to choose another combatant to fight in their place. The Ushaan is settled when a combatant is rendered defenseless. Archer takes the Tellarite's place, and wins the duel when he cuts off Shran's antenna.<ref name=United/>\n\n== Appearance ==\nAndorians have blue blood, blue skin, white hair, and antennae on the crown of the skull. By the time of the 2001 \u2013 2005 TV series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the antennae were depicted as protruding from the forehead, and capable of movement, used for [[gesture|gesturing]] and [[vestibular system|balancing]]. If cut off, an antenna will grow back after nine months, though the time can be reduced by half with electrical stimulation and brisk cranial massage.<ref name=United>{{cite episode|title=[[United (Star Trek: Enterprise)|United]]|series=Star Trek: Enterprise|airdate=February 4, 2005|network=UPN|season=4|number=13}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of Star Trek races#Aenar|Aenar]] are a more reclusive, blue-white-skinned subspecies of Androians. They were considered a myth until contact was remade in the episode \"[[The Aenar]]\", during the fourth season of Enterprise. The Aenar are blind, but exhibit [[telepathy|telepathic]] and [[telemetry|telemetric]] abilities.

It has also been referred to as Andor.<ref name=ProphetCards/> In a DVD bonus feature for the 4th season of ''Enterprise'', episode writers [[Judith Reeves-Stevens|Judith]] and [[Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] stated that Andor was the gas giant, Andoria the moon, and that this was a conscious effort to address the discrepancy. Most of its cities are built underground to take advantage of [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] warmth. Temperatures have been known to reach \u221228 \u00b0[[Celsius|C]] in the summer. Andoria has at least one moon or neighboring planet. Andorians share their homeworld with an obscure telepathic subspecies, [[List of Star Trek races#Aenar|Aenar]], which have either light blue or white skin.<ref name=TheAenar/>\n\nThe non-canonical ''Star Trek Star Charts'' (2002) cites Andor as the seventh planet in orbit around the star [[Procyon]] (Alpha Canis Minoris) in the [[Galactic quadrant#Alpha Quadrant|Beta quadrant]],<ref>Geoffrey Mandel, ''Star Trek Star Charts: The Complete Atlas of Star Trek'' (NY: Pocket Books, 2002), 52.</ref> but previous material has Andor as the eighth planet of the orange dwarf [[Epsilon Indi]] in the [[Galactic quadrant#Alpha Quadrant|Alpha quadrant]].<ref>Eileen Palestine, ed., ''Star Fleet Medical Reference Manual'' (NY: Ballantine Books, 1977), 58.</ref><ref name=\"Shane Johnson 1989\">Shane Johnson, ''The Worlds of the Federation'' (NY: Pocket Books, 1989), 22.</ref> Andor is near [[Betazoid#Betazed|Betazed]], [[Earth]], [[Tellarite|Tellar]], and [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]].\n\n== Noncanonical information ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2008}}\nA 1970s technical fiction book, ''The Starfleet Medical Reference Manual'', held that Andorians were the only known semi-insectoid race in Federation territory, with a limited [[exoskeleton]] and antennae used for both quadriscopic vision reception and focused hearing.<ref>Eileen Palestine, ed., ''Star Fleet Medical Reference Manual'' (NY: Ballantine Books, 1977).</ref> These points were repeated in the 1980s book ''Worlds of the Federation''.<ref name=\"Shane Johnson 1989\"/> Fully insectoid races depicted or referred to onscreen include the unseen Jarada in the ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[The Big Goodbye]]\", and the [[Xindi (Star Trek)#Xindi-Insectoids|Xindi]], which were introduced in ''Star Trek: Enterprise''{{'}}s third season.\n\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine relaunch|Deep Space Nine]]'' relaunch novels, four-person Andorian marriages were extrapolated into four sexes (''thaan'', ''chen'', ''shen'', and ''zhen'').<ref>S. D. Perry, ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine \u2013 Unity'' (NY: Pocket Books, 2003).</ref> A recurring plot point in the post-TV series novels is that the rarity of compatible Andorian foursomes produced extremely low reproduction rates which, in tandem with genetic weaknesses, led to the species' near extinction.\n\nSimilarly, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (comics)|Star Trek: Starfleet Academy]]'' refers to complex yet flexible marital structures, involving one or more fathers, and describes Andorians as passionate, with a violent history.<ref>''Star Trek: Starfleet Academy'', issue #13, ''Parents' Day'' (Marvel/Paramount Comics, 1997).</ref>\n\nIn the Pocket Books continuity, specifically the 2010 novel, ''Star Trek: Typhon Pact \u2013 Paths of Disharmony'' by [[Dayton Ward]], the Andorian Empire withdraws from the Federation in 2382.<ref>Dayton Ward, ''Star Trek: Typhon Pact \u2013 Paths of Disharmony'' (NY: Pocket Books, 2010).</ref> However, the Andorian government still maintains diplomatic relations with the Federation, and Andorian officers are allowed to remain in [[Starfleet]] if they so choose. Despite Andor's withdrawal, a sizable percentage of the population \u2013 represented in the Andorian government by the \"New Progressive Party\", as opposed to the secessionist \"Visionist Party\" \u2013 favored continuing membership in the Federation, opening the possibility of a later reunification. In a subsequent novel, Dayton Ward's ''Star Trek: The Fall \u2013 Peaceable Kingdoms'', Andor does rejoin the Federation.<ref>Dayton Ward, ''Star Trek: The Fall \u2013 Peaceable Kingdoms'' (NY: Pocket Books, 2013).</ref>\n\nIn the [[Free-to-play]] online role-playing game ''[[Star Trek Online]]'', which takes place in 2409, the Andorians are still ordinary members of the Federation.\n\nIn the [[Fan film]] episodic series ''[[Starship Exeter]]'', the communications officer on the bridge is an Andorian Lieutenant named B'fuselek.  In this series it is explained that Andorians' antennae give the Andorians the ability to detect nearby fluctuations in gravity, and know their position in relation to these gravity differences. Andorians and Vulcans also have a history of feuding over many things.\n\n==Appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|+ ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

The Bronx was originally part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], but it was ceded to [[Manhattan|New York County]] in two major parts ([[West Bronx]], 1874 and [[East Bronx]], 1895) before it became Bronx County. Originally, the area was part of the [[Lenape]]'s [[Lenapehoking]] territory inhabited by [[Siwanoy]] of the [[Wappinger]] Confederacy. Over time, European colonists converted the borough into farmlands.\n\n===Before 1914===\n{{See also|List of former municipalities in New York City}}\nThe development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between [[New England]] and New York ([[Manhattan]]). Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule.

Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] changed for some Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]''.<ref>{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref> Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]], particularly in the [[South Bronx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanrealities.org/locations/south_bronx/ |title=The South Bronx |publisher=American Realities}}</ref> Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies\u2014a process known as [[redlining]].

The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx. One explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money, as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945795-2,00.html |title=Arson for Hate and Profit |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 31, 1977 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}</ref> The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 2004\">Gonzalez (2004)</ref>\n\nOut of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate.

Like the northernmost part of [[upper Manhattan]], the [[West Bronx]]'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx.

Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.\n\nThree major north\u2013south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].

Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.\n\nMost east\u2013west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/02/unlock-the-grid-then-ditch-the-maps-and-apps/ \"Unlock the Grid, Then Ditch the Maps and Apps\"], [[WNET]], February 24, 2012.

It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G.

Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres.

The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).<ref>(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)</ref> The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P.

The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].\n\nThe original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.\n\nThe original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009. It is located north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park.

The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002.

Four non-profit news outlets, ''[[Norwood News]]'', ''Mount Hope Monitor'', ''[[Mott Haven Herald]]'' and ''The [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] Express'' serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of ''The Riverdale Press'', Bernard Stein, won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1959.)\n\nThe Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, ''[[The Bronx Home News]]'', which started publishing on January 20, 1907, and merged into the ''[[New York Post]]'' in 1948. It became a special section of the ''Post'', sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.\n\n====Radio and television====\nOne of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is [[WFUV]], a [[National Public Radio]]-affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from [[Fordham University]]'s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building owned by [[Montefiore Medical Center]].\n\nThe City of New York has an official television station run by [[NYC Media]] and broadcasting from [[Bronx Community College]], and [[Cablevision]] operates [[News 12 Networks|News 12 The Bronx]], both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. [[Co-op City]] was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond [[Manhattan]], to have its own [[cable television]] provider. The local [[public-access television]] station [[BronxNet]] originates from Herbert H. Lehman College, the borough's only four year CUNY school, and provides [[government-access television]] (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.<ref>Its website showcases very short selections (less than 20 seconds and over 2 MB each in uncompressed [[AIFF]] format) from ''[http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm Bronx Music Vol.1]'', an out-of-press [[compact disc]] of the old and new sounds and artists of the Bronx. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813130030/http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Gangs===\nThe Bronx is the home of many gangs, including:\n* [[Dominicans Don't Play]] - formed around 1990, it primarily targets high school students and second-generation immigrants to join their gang, and make most of their money from robberies and drug deals.<ref name=NYPost-Gangs>https://nypost.com/2007/10/28/gangs-of-new-york/</ref>\n* [[Trinitarios]] - also formed around 1990, a spin-off of Dominicans Don't Play, mostly involved with drug, sex, and weapons trafficking<ref>https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/trinitarios-long-history-gang-tied-bronx-stabbing</ref><ref>https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/ny-metro-gang-violence-the-bronx-trinitarios-20180627-story.html</ref>\n* [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] - a nationwide gang whose Bronx chapter began in 1986, involved with gun and drug trafficking, extortion, credit card fraud, and auto theft as their sources of income<ref name=NYPost-Gangs/>\n* [[\u00d1etas]] - a gang that was started in 1979 in Puerto Rico.

Hollywood films such as ''[[From This Day Forward]]'' (1946), set in [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], occasionally delved into Bronx life. [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life<ref>{{cite web |last=Chronopoulos |first=Themis |title=\"Paddy Chayefsky's 'Marty' and Its Significance to the Social History of Arthur Avenue, The Bronx, in the 1950s.\" The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLIV (Spring/Fall 2007): 50\u201359. |url=http://themis.slass.org/marty.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120181558/http://themis.slass.org/marty.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 20, 2013 }}</ref> was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film ''[[The Catered Affair]]'', and in the 1993 [[Robert De Niro]]/[[Chazz Palminteri]] film, ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', [[Spike Lee]]'s 1999 movie ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', centered in an [[Italian-American]] Bronx community, 1994's ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]'' that takes place in the predominantly [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] neighborhood of the South Bronx, and ''Doughboys'', the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.\n\nThe Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the \"[[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]\", a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by [[New York Yankees]] fans. The sound can be heard, for example, on the [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers recording of \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (from the 1942 [[Disney]] [[animated film]] of the [[Der Fuehrer's Face|same name]]), repeatedly lambasting [[Adolf Hitler]] with: \"We'll Heil!

The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that \"The Bronx is burning\": in 1974 it was the title of both a ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[editorial]] and a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]]. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] [[The Bronx Is Burning#Summary|is wrongly remembered to have said something like]], \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning\". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |url=https://archive.org/details/ladiesgentlemenb00mahl |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn=0-312-42430-2}}</ref> A new feature-length documentary film by [[Edwin Pagan]] called ''Bronx Burning''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115184832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2009|title=Bronx Burning (2008)|date=January 15, 2009|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}</ref> is in production<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |title=Opportunities for Arts Organizations and Community Based Organizations |publisher=Bronx Council on the Arts |work=E-News Update |date=January 2006 |access-date=December 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626082500/http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |archive-date=June 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.\n\nBronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel ''The Wanderers'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.\n\nThe 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.\n\n====As a setting====\nBronx native [[Nancy Savoca]]'s 1989 comedy, ''[[True Love (1989 film)|True Love]]'', explores two [[Italian-American]] Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding. The film, which debuted [[Annabella Sciorra]] and [[Ron Eldard]] as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The [[CBS]] [[television sitcom]] ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', 1998\u20132004, was more ambiguous. The show starred [[Ted Danson]] as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.\n\n[[Penny Marshall]]'s 1990 film ''[[Awakenings]]'', which was nominated for several [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], is based on neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]' [[Awakenings (book)|1973 account]] of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of [[encephalitis]] but briefly responded to the drug [[L-dopa]]. [[Robin Williams]] played the physician; [[Robert De Niro]] was one of the patients who emerged from a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot not far from Sacks' actual [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] residence. A 1973 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3D8103DF932A15752C0A9679C8B63 Yorkshire Television documentary] and \"A Kind of Alaska\", a 1985 play by [[Harold Pinter]],<ref>({{ISBN|0-573-12129-X}})</ref> were also based on Sacks' book.\n\n[[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2000 ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' was quickly billed \"[[Good Will Hunting]] in the Hood.\" [[Sean Connery]] is in the title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel that garnered the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. He meets 16-year-old Jamal, portrayed by [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]], a gifted basketball player and aspiring writer from the Bronx, and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nThe 2012 documentary \"South Bronx United\" features the [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]] neighborhood and its conflict over the online grocery delivery service [[Fresh Direct]]'s move of their trucking facility from [[Long Island City]] to the [[South Bronx]].\n\n===In literature===\n{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}\n\n====Books====\nThe Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.</ref> In Jacob M. Appel's short story, \"The Grand Concourse\" (2007),<ref>''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]</ref> a woman who grew up in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),<ref>[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 1980; {{ISBN|0-671-41475-5}}</ref> an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.\n\nBy contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)<ref>Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) {{ISBN|978-0-374-11535-7}}, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42757-3}}</ref> portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.\"<ref>Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>\n\n[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards. [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s \"[[Savage in Limbo]]\" is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters feel they are unable to move.\n\n====Poetry====\nIn poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">The Bronx\nNo Thonx\n: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931</poem>\n\nNash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I can't seem to escape\nthe sins of my smart-alec youth;\nHere are my amends.\nI wrote those lines, \"The Bronx?\nNo thonx\";\nI shudder to confess them.\nNow I'm an older, wiser man\nI cry, \"The Bronx?\nGod bless them!\"<ref name=\"thonx\" /></poem>\n\nIn 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''\u2014consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events. [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[St. Mary's Park (Bronx)|St. Mary's Park]], and Brook Avenue are a few of the schools, parks, and streets Rodriguez uses as subjects for his poems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/wr-rodriguez/banks-brook-avenue/|title=From the Banks of Brook Avenue by W.R.

The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'', as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther's poem, \"Bronx\", which is described as a celebration of the borough's landmarks.

The mid to late century were hard times, as the Bronx changed during 1950\u201385 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty in some areas. The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.<ref name=\"Olmsted 1989; Olmsted 1998\"/>\n\n====New York City expands====\n[[File:Bronx 1900.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] and [[161st Street (Bronx)|161st Street]] as it appeared around 1900]] [[File:Simpson Street Station.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Simpson Street (IRT White Plains Road Line)|Simpson Street]] elevated station was built in 1904 and opened on November 26, 1904.

Faster transportation enabled rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to Manhattan in 1904.<ref name=\"Olmsted 1989; Olmsted 1998\">Olmsted (1989); Olmsted (1998)</ref>\n\nThe South Bronx was a manufacturing center for many years and was noted as a center of [[piano]] manufacturing in the early part of the 20th century.

Extensions of the [[New York City Subway]] contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction. Among these groups, many [[Irish Americans]], [[Italian Americans]], and especially [[Jewish Americans]] settled here. In addition, [[French American|French]], [[German Americans|German]], [[Polish American|Polish]], and other immigrants moved into the borough. As evidence of the change in population, by 1937, 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population),<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]], 1943'', page 494, citing the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the Jewish Statistical Bureau of the [[Synagogue Council of America]]</ref> while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011.

Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] changed for some Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]''.<ref>{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref> Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]], particularly in the [[South Bronx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanrealities.org/locations/south_bronx/ |title=The South Bronx |publisher=American Realities}}</ref> Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies\u2014a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a \"[[planned shrinkage]]\" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.<ref>Roderick Wallace: \"A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.\" ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1\u201333, and \"Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx\", ''Social Science & Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801\u2013813\u2014abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ PubMed].

The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx. One explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money, as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945795-2,00.html |title=Arson for Hate and Profit |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 31, 1977 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}</ref> The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 2004\">Gonzalez (2004)</ref>\n\nOut of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate.

The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].\n\nThe original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.\n\nThe original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009.

The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002.

Four non-profit news outlets, ''[[Norwood News]]'', ''Mount Hope Monitor'', ''[[Mott Haven Herald]]'' and ''The [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] Express'' serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of ''The Riverdale Press'', Bernard Stein, won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1959.)\n\nThe Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, ''[[The Bronx Home News]]'', which started publishing on January 20, 1907, and merged into the ''[[New York Post]]'' in 1948. It became a special section of the ''Post'', sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.\n\n====Radio and television====\nOne of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is [[WFUV]], a [[National Public Radio]]-affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from [[Fordham University]]'s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building owned by [[Montefiore Medical Center]].\n\nThe City of New York has an official television station run by [[NYC Media]] and broadcasting from [[Bronx Community College]], and [[Cablevision]] operates [[News 12 Networks|News 12 The Bronx]], both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. [[Co-op City]] was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond [[Manhattan]], to have its own [[cable television]] provider. The local [[public-access television]] station [[BronxNet]] originates from Herbert H. Lehman College, the borough's only four year CUNY school, and provides [[government-access television]] (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.<ref>Its website showcases very short selections (less than 20 seconds and over 2 MB each in uncompressed [[AIFF]] format) from ''[http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm Bronx Music Vol.1]'', an out-of-press [[compact disc]] of the old and new sounds and artists of the Bronx. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813130030/http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Gangs===\nThe Bronx is the home of many gangs, including:\n* [[Dominicans Don't Play]] - formed around 1990, it primarily targets high school students and second-generation immigrants to join their gang, and make most of their money from robberies and drug deals.<ref name=NYPost-Gangs>https://nypost.com/2007/10/28/gangs-of-new-york/</ref>\n* [[Trinitarios]] - also formed around 1990, a spin-off of Dominicans Don't Play, mostly involved with drug, sex, and weapons trafficking<ref>https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/trinitarios-long-history-gang-tied-bronx-stabbing</ref><ref>https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/ny-metro-gang-violence-the-bronx-trinitarios-20180627-story.html</ref>\n* [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] - a nationwide gang whose Bronx chapter began in 1986, involved with gun and drug trafficking, extortion, credit card fraud, and auto theft as their sources of income<ref name=NYPost-Gangs/>\n* [[\u00d1etas]] - a gang that was started in 1979 in Puerto Rico.

Hollywood films such as ''[[From This Day Forward]]'' (1946), set in [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], occasionally delved into Bronx life. [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life<ref>{{cite web |last=Chronopoulos |first=Themis |title=\"Paddy Chayefsky's 'Marty' and Its Significance to the Social History of Arthur Avenue, The Bronx, in the 1950s.\" The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLIV (Spring/Fall 2007): 50\u201359. |url=http://themis.slass.org/marty.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120181558/http://themis.slass.org/marty.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 20, 2013 }}</ref> was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film ''[[The Catered Affair]]'', and in the 1993 [[Robert De Niro]]/[[Chazz Palminteri]] film, ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', [[Spike Lee]]'s 1999 movie ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', centered in an [[Italian-American]] Bronx community, 1994's ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]'' that takes place in the predominantly [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] neighborhood of the South Bronx, and ''Doughboys'', the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.\n\nThe Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the \"[[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]\", a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by [[New York Yankees]] fans. The sound can be heard, for example, on the [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers recording of \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (from the 1942 [[Disney]] [[animated film]] of the [[Der Fuehrer's Face|same name]]), repeatedly lambasting [[Adolf Hitler]] with: \"We'll Heil!

The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that \"The Bronx is burning\": in 1974 it was the title of both a ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[editorial]] and a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]]. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] [[The Bronx Is Burning#Summary|is wrongly remembered to have said something like]], \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning\". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |url=https://archive.org/details/ladiesgentlemenb00mahl |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn=0-312-42430-2}}</ref> A new feature-length documentary film by [[Edwin Pagan]] called ''Bronx Burning''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115184832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2009|title=Bronx Burning (2008)|date=January 15, 2009|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}</ref> is in production<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |title=Opportunities for Arts Organizations and Community Based Organizations |publisher=Bronx Council on the Arts |work=E-News Update |date=January 2006 |access-date=December 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626082500/http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |archive-date=June 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.\n\nBronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel ''The Wanderers'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.\n\nThe 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.\n\n====As a setting====\nBronx native [[Nancy Savoca]]'s 1989 comedy, ''[[True Love (1989 film)|True Love]]'', explores two [[Italian-American]] Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding. The film, which debuted [[Annabella Sciorra]] and [[Ron Eldard]] as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The [[CBS]] [[television sitcom]] ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', 1998\u20132004, was more ambiguous. The show starred [[Ted Danson]] as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.\n\n[[Penny Marshall]]'s 1990 film ''[[Awakenings]]'', which was nominated for several [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], is based on neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]' [[Awakenings (book)|1973 account]] of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of [[encephalitis]] but briefly responded to the drug [[L-dopa]]. [[Robin Williams]] played the physician; [[Robert De Niro]] was one of the patients who emerged from a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot not far from Sacks' actual [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] residence. A 1973 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3D8103DF932A15752C0A9679C8B63 Yorkshire Television documentary] and \"A Kind of Alaska\", a 1985 play by [[Harold Pinter]],<ref>({{ISBN|0-573-12129-X}})</ref> were also based on Sacks' book.\n\n[[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2000 ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' was quickly billed \"[[Good Will Hunting]] in the Hood.\" [[Sean Connery]] is in the title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel that garnered the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. He meets 16-year-old Jamal, portrayed by [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]], a gifted basketball player and aspiring writer from the Bronx, and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nThe 2012 documentary \"South Bronx United\" features the [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]] neighborhood and its conflict over the online grocery delivery service [[Fresh Direct]]'s move of their trucking facility from [[Long Island City]] to the [[South Bronx]].\n\n===In literature===\n{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}\n\n====Books====\nThe Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.</ref> In Jacob M. Appel's short story, \"The Grand Concourse\" (2007),<ref>''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]</ref> a woman who grew up in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),<ref>[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 1980; {{ISBN|0-671-41475-5}}</ref> an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.\n\nBy contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)<ref>Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) {{ISBN|978-0-374-11535-7}}, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42757-3}}</ref> portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.\"<ref>Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>\n\n[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards. [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s \"[[Savage in Limbo]]\" is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters feel they are unable to move.\n\n====Poetry====\nIn poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">The Bronx\nNo Thonx\n: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931</poem>\n\nNash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I can't seem to escape\nthe sins of my smart-alec youth;\nHere are my amends.\nI wrote those lines, \"The Bronx?\nNo thonx\";\nI shudder to confess them.\nNow I'm an older, wiser man\nI cry, \"The Bronx?\nGod bless them!\"<ref name=\"thonx\" /></poem>\n\nIn 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''\u2014consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events. [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[St. Mary's Park (Bronx)|St. Mary's Park]], and Brook Avenue are a few of the schools, parks, and streets Rodriguez uses as subjects for his poems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/wr-rodriguez/banks-brook-avenue/|title=From the Banks of Brook Avenue by W.R.

The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'', as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther's poem, \"Bronx\", which is described as a celebration of the borough's landmarks.

The purpose of SOE and OSS was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers. SOE and OSS agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. After World War II Hall worked for the [[Special Activities Division]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).\n\nHall was a pioneering agent for the SOE, arriving in France in August 1941, the first female agent to take up residence in France. She created the Heckler network in [[Lyon]]. Over the next 15 months, she \"became an expert at support operations -- organizing resistance movements; supplying agents with money, weapons, and supplies; helping downed airmen to escape; offering safe houses and medical assistance to wounded agents and pilots.\"<ref>Gralley, pp 2-3, [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-1/virginia-halls-steps.html]</ref>   She fled France in November 1942 to avoid capture by the Germans. \n\nShe returned to France as a wireless operator for the OSS in March 1944 and a member of the Saint network. Working in territory still occupied by the German army and mostly without the assistance of other OSS agents, she supplied arms, training, and direction to French resistance groups, called [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]], especially in [[Haute-Loire]] where the maquis cleared the department of German soldiers prior to the arrival of the American army in September 1944. \n\nThe Germans gave her the nickname ''Artemis,'' and the [[Gestapo]] reportedly considered her \"the most dangerous of all Allied spies.\"<ref>Meyer, Roger (October 2008). \"World War II's Most Dangerous Spy\" ''The American Legion Magazine'' p. 54</ref> Hall had an artificial foot she named \"Cuthbert.\" She was also known as \"the limping lady.\" \n{{quote box\n| align=right\n| width=35%\n| quote=Virginia Hall left no memoir, granted no interviews, and spoke little about her overseas life--even with relatives.

She wanted to finish her studies in Europe, so she traveled the Continent and studied in France, Germany, and Austria, finally landing an appointment as a Consular Service clerk at the American Embassy in [[Warsaw]], Poland in 1931. A few months later she transferred to Smyrna, known later as [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]].  In 1932, she tripped and accidentally shot herself in the left foot while hunting birds. Her leg was amputated below the knee and replaced with a wooden appendage which she named \"Cuthbert\". After losing her leg, she worked again as a consular clerk in [[Venice]] and in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].<ref>Purnell, Sonia (2019), ''A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II,'' New York: Viking, p. 12-21.</ref>\n\nHall made several attempts to become a diplomat with the [[United States Foreign Service]], but women were rarely hired. In 1937, she was turned down by the [[Department of State]] because of an obscure rule against hiring people with disabilities as diplomats. Even an appeal for her to be hired to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], himself disabled,  was unheeded. She resigned from the [[Department of State]] in March 1939, still a consular clerk.<ref>Purnell, pp. 19-20</ref> \n\n==World War II==\nEarly in World War II in February 1940, Hall became an ambulance driver for the army of France.  After the defeat of France in June 1940, she made her way to [[Spain]] where, by chance, she met a British intelligence officer named George Bellows. Bellows was impressed with her and gave her the telephone number of a \"friend\" who might be able to help her find employment in [[England]]. The friend was [[Nicolas Bodington]], who worked for the newly-created Special Operations Executive (SOE).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Purnell, pp. 13-29</ref>\n\n==Special Operations Executive==\nHall joined the SOE in April 1941 and after training arrived in [[Vichy France]], unoccupied by Germany and nominally independent at that time, on August 23, 1941. She was the second female agent to be sent to France by SOE's F (France) Section, and the first to remain there for a lengthy period of time. (SOE F section would send 42 female agents to France during World War II, of whom 26 would survive the war.)<ref>Foot, pp. 465-469. Estimates of the number of SOE's female agents differ; 42 is the number listed by Foot, the official historian of the SOE.</ref> Hall's cover was as a reporter for the [[New York Post]] which gave her license to interview people, gather information and file stories filled with details useful to military planners. She based herself in [[Lyon]]. She turned away from her \"chic Parisian wardrobe\" to become inconspicuous and often quickly changed her appearance through make-up and disguise.<ref>Purnell, pp. 39-40, 46-47</ref> \n[[File:Les Marguerites Fleuriront ce Soir - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|''Les Marguerites Fleuriront ce Soir'' by Jeffrey W. Bass|thumb|right|200px|Hall was a wireless operator during her second mission to France.]]\nHall was a pioneer as a World War II secret agent and had to learn on her own the \"exacting tasks of being available, arranging contacts, recommending who to bribe and where to hide, soothing the jagged nerves of agents on the run and supervising the distribution of wireless sets.\"<ref>Foot, p. 171</ref> The network (or circuit) of SOE agents she founded was named [[SOE F Section networks#Stationer|Heckler]].<ref>Gralley, p. 2. [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-1/virginia-halls-steps.html]</ref> Among her recruits was gynecologist Jean Rousset and Germaine Gu\u00e9rin, the owner of a prominent brothel in Lyon. Gu\u00e9rin made several [[safe house|safehouse]]s available to Hall and passed along tidbits of information she and her female employees heard from German officers visiting the brothel.<ref>Purnell, pp. 59-62</ref> \n\nThe official historian of the SOE, M.R.D Foot, said that the motto of every successful secret agent was \"''dubito, ergo sum''\" (\"I doubt, therefore I survive.\").<ref>Foot, p. 311</ref> Hall's lengthy tenure in France without being arrested illustrates her caution. In October 1941, she sensed danger and declined to attend a meeting of SOE agents in [[Marseille]] which the French police raided and captured a dozen agents. After that debacle, Hall was one of the few SOE agents still at large in France and the only one with a means of transmitting information to London. George Whittinghill, an American diplomat in Lyon, allowed her to smuggle reports and letters to London in the diplomatic pouch.<ref>Purnell, pp. 47, 52-53</ref>    \n\nThe winter of 1941-42 was miserable for Hall. In a letter she said that if SOE would send her a piece of soap she would be \"both very happy and much cleaner.\"  In the absence of an SOE wireless operator her access to the American diplomatic pouch was the only means the few agents left at large in France had of communicating with London.  She continued building contacts in southern France and she assisted in the brief missions of SOE agents [[Peter Churchill]] and [[Benjamin Cowburn]] and earned high compliments from both. She avoided contact with an SOE agent sent to Lyon named [[Georges Duboudin]] and refused to introduce him to her contacts.  She regarded him as amateurish and lax in security.  When SOE headquarters directed that Duboudin should supervise her, she told SOE to \"lay off.\"  She also avoided contact with [[Philippe de Vom\u00e9court]], who, although an authentic French Resistance leader, was lax in security and grandiose.<ref>Purnell, pp. 69-89, 99-100.</ref>          \n\nAnother task Hall took on was helping British airmen, shot down or crashed over Europe, escape and return to England. Downed airmen who found their way to Lyon were told to go to the American Consulate and say they were a \"friend of Olivier.\" \"Olivier\" was Hall and she, with the help of brothel-owner Guerrin and other friends, hid, fed, and helped dozens of airmen escape France to neutral [[Spain]] and hence back to England.<ref>Purnell, p. 64</ref>   \n\nThe French nicknamed her \"la dame qui boite\" and the Germans put \"the limping lady\" on their most wanted list.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===The Jailbreak===\nHall learned that the 12 agents arrested by the French police in October 1941 were incarcerated at the Mauzac prison near [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]]. Wireless operator [[Georges B\u00e9gu\u00e9]] smuggled out letters to Hall from the prison and she recruited Gaby Bloch, wife of the prisoner [[Jean-Pierre Bloch]], as an ally to plan an escape.  Bloch visited the prison frequently to bring food and other items to her husband, including tins of sardines. The tools she smuggled in and the sardine tins enabled B\u00e9gu\u00e9 to make a key to the door of the barracks where the prisoners were kept.  Hall, too well known to visit the prison, assembled safe houses, vehicles, and helpers. A priest smuggled in a radio to B\u00e9gu\u00e9, and from within the prison, he began transmitting to London.  On July 15, 1942, the prisoners escaped and, after hiding in the woods while an intense manhunt took place, all of them met up with Hall in Lyon by August 11. From there, they were smuggled to Spain and thence back to England.<ref>Purnell, pp. 113-126</ref>  The official historian of SOE, [[M.R.D. Foot]] called the escape \"one of the war's most useful operations of its kind\", as several of the escapees would return to France and become leaders of SOE networks.<ref>Foot, pp. 203-204</ref>\n\n===Germans retaliate===\nThe Germans were furious about the escape from Mauzac prison and the laxity of the French police in allowing the escape. The Gestapo flooded Vichy France with 500 agents and the [[Abwehr]] also stepped up operations to infiltrate and destroy the fledgling French Resistance and the SOE networks. The Germans focused on Lyon, the epicenter of the resistance. Hall had counted on contacts she had with the French police to protect her, but, under pressure from the Germans, her police contacts were no longer reliable.<ref>Purnell, pp. 127-137</ref>\n\nIn May 1942, Hall had agreed to have messages from the [[R\u00e9seau Gloria|Gloria Network]], a French-run resistance movement based in Paris, transmitted to SOE in London. In August Gloria was infiltrated by a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and Abwehr agent named [[Robert Alesch]] and its leadership was captured by the Abwehr. Alesch also made contact with Hall in August, claiming to be an agent of Gloria and offering intelligence of apparently high value. She had doubts about Alesch, especially when she learned that Gloria had been destroyed, but was persuaded of his bona fides, as was the London headquarters of SOE. Alesch was able to penetrate Hall's network of contacts, including the capture of wireless operators and the sending of false messages to London in her name. <ref>Purnell 144-152</ref><ref>\"Gabrielle Jeanine Picabia,\" ''Musee de la Resistance,'' [http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media2761-Gabrielle-Jeanine-Picabia-chef-du-rA], accessed 29 Jan 2020</ref>\n\n===Escape===\nOn November 7, 1942, the American Consulate in Lyon told Hall that an allied invasion of [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] was imminent. In response to the invasion, on November 8, the Germans moved to [[Case Anton|occupy Vichy France]]. Hall anticipated correctly that the suppression of the Gestapo and Abwehr would become even more severe and she fled Lyon without telling anyone, including her closest contacts. She escaped by train from Lyon to [[Perpignan]], then, with a guide, walked over a 7,500 foot pass in the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain, covering up to 50 miles over two days in considerable discomfort.<ref>Gralley, p. 3-4.[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-1/virginia-halls-steps.html]</ref><ref>Purnell, pp. 158-159</ref> Hall had named her artificial foot \"Cuthbert\", and she signaled to SOE before her escape that she hoped that \"Cuthbert\" would not trouble her on the way. The SOE did not understand the reference and replied, \"If Cuthbert troublesome, eliminate him.\". After arriving in Spain, she was arrested by the Spanish authorities for illegally crossing the border, but the American Embassy eventually secured her release. She worked for SOE for a time in Madrid, then returned to London in July 1943 where she was quietly made an honorary [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613142626/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/oss/art05.htm|title=Special Operations|date=13 June 2007|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>\n\n==Office of Strategic Services==\n[[File:French identification certificate for Marcelle Montagne, an alias of OSS agent Virginia Hall.jpg|thumb|French identification certificate for \"Marcelle Montagne\" forged by OSS]]\n[[File:Haute-Loire-Position.svg|thumb|200px|right|From July to September 1944 Hall operated in Haute-Loire Department.]]\nOn her return to London, SOE leaders declined to send Hall back to France as an agent despite her requests.  She was compromised, they said, and too much at risk. However, she took a wireless course and contacted the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) about a job.  She was hired by the Special Operations Branch at the low rank and pay of a second lieutenant and on March 21, 1944 returned to France, arriving by motor gun boat at Beg-an-Fry in [[Brittany]]. Her artificial leg prevented her from parachuting. OSS provided her with a forged French identification card in the name of Marcelle Montagne. Her code name was Diane. The objective of the OSS teams was to arm and train the resistance groups, called [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], so they could support with sabotage and guerrilla activities the allied [[invasion of Normandy]], which would take place on June 6, 1944. <ref>Purnell, pp. 191-193, p. 197</ref><ref>Rossiter, Margaret L. (1986), ''Women in the Resistance,'' New York: Praeger, pp. 102-193</ref>   \n\nHall was disguised as an older woman, with gray hair and her teeth filed down to resemble that of a peasant woman. She disguised her limp with the shuffle of an old woman. Landing with her was Henri Lassot, 62 years old. Lassot was the organiser and leader of the new Saint network, it being too radical a thought that a woman could lead an SOE or OSS network of agents. She was Lassot's wireless operator. They were the fourth and fifth OSS agents to arrive in France. Lassot carried with him one million francs, equivalent to 5,000 British pounds; Hall had 500,000 francs with her. Hall quickly separated herself from Lassot whom she characterized as too talkative and a security risk, instructing her contacts not to tell him where she was. Aware that her accent would reveal that she was not French she engaged a French woman, Madame Rabut, to accompany and speak for her.<ref>Purnell, pp. 197-199, 203-206, 209</ref>  \n\nFrom March to July 1944, Hall roamed around France south of Paris, posing sometimes as an elderly milkmaid (and on one occasion selling cheese she had made to a group of German soldiers). She found and organized drop zones, established several safe houses, and made and renewed contacts, notably with Philippe de Vomecourt, in the Resistance.   She  organized and supplied with arms several resistance groups of a hundred men each in the [[Cher (department)|Cher]] and [[Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire|Cosne]]. She attempted unsuccessfully to organize a jailbreak to gain freedom for her three nephews, captives of the Germans in Paris. Her resistance groups undertook many successful small-scale attacks on infrastructure and German soldiers.<ref>Purnell, pp 189, 207-208, 222-223.</ref><ref>\"Activity Report of Virginia Hall (Diane),\" F-Section, Heckler, [http://www.801492.org/Air%20Crew/Ewart/Saint-Heckler%20Reports.pdf], accessed 1 Feb 2020</ref>   \n\nHall was next given the job of helping the maquis in southern France harass the Germans in support of the allied invasion, [[Operation Dragoon]], of the south which would took place on August 15, 1944. In July, Hall was ordered to go to [[Haute-Loire]] department, arriving July 14, quitting her disguise, and establishing her headquarters in a barn near [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]]. As a woman and as a lowly second lieutenant she had problems asserting her authority over the maquis groups and the self-proclaimed colonels heading them. She complained to OSS headquarters, \"you send people out ostensibly to work with me and for me, but you do not give me the necessary authority.\"<ref>Rossiter, pp. 196-197</ref> She told the maquis leaders that she would finance them and give them arms on condition that they would be advised by her, but the prickly maquis leaders continued to be a problem for her. <ref>Hall, p. 1168, [http://www.801492.org/Air%20Crew/Ewart/Saint-Heckler%20Reports.pdf]</ref> The three planeloads of supplies she received in late July and the money she distributed for expenses gained their grudging acquiescence. \n\nThe three battalions of maquis (about 1,500 men) in her area undertook a number of successful sabotage operations. Now part of the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI), they forced the German occupiers to withdraw from [[Le Puy-en-Velay]] and head north with the rest of the retreating German forces. Belatedly, a [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] team, called Jeremy, of three men parachuted in on August 25 to undertake the training and supply of the battalions.<ref>Rossiter, pp. 195-196</ref> Hall commented wryly, \"this was after the Germans had been liquidated in the department of the Haute Loire and Le Puy liberated.\"<ref>Hall, p. 1169, [http://www.801492.org/Air%20Crew/Ewart/Saint-Heckler%20Reports.pdf]</ref>\n\nHall and several of the British and American military officers working for her left the Haute Loraine and arrived in Paris on September 22. The war was over for her.<ref>Purnell, p. 267</ref>\n\n==Post war and death==\nHall visited Lyon to learn the fate of the people who had worked for her there.  Her closest associates, brothel-owner Germaine Gu\u00e9rin and gynecologist Jean Rousset, had both been captured by the Germans and sent to concentration camps, but they survived.  She arranged 80,000 francs (400 British pounds) compensation from the [[United Kingdom]] for Gu\u00e9rin, but most of her other helpers received nothing. Many of the people she knew had not survived -- including her three nephews who had been executed at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].<ref>Purnell, pp. 281-282</ref> The German agent and priest, Robert Alesch, who had betrayed her network in Lyon was captured after the war and executed in Paris.<ref>\"Picabia,\" [http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media2761-Gabrielle-Jeanine-Picabia-chef-du-rA]</ref>\n\nWhile in Haute-Loire, Hall had met and fallen in love with an OSS lieutenant, Paul Goillot, who worked for her. He was eight years younger and six inches shorter than she was. In 1957, the couple married after living together off-and-on for years. She joined the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 1947, one of the first women hired by the new agency.  Her desk-bound job as an intelligence analyst was to gather information about Soviet penetration of European countries. She resigned in 1948 and then was rehired in 1950 for another lowly desk job. In 1951, she worked alongside Goillot as members of the [[Special Activities Division]] supporting undercover activities to prevent the spread of communism in Europe.

The purpose of SOE and OSS was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers. SOE and OSS agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. After World War II Hall worked for the [[Special Activities Division]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).\n\nHall was a pioneering agent for the SOE, arriving in France in August 1941, the first female agent to take up residence in France. She created the Heckler network in [[Lyon]]. Over the next 15 months, she \"became an expert at support operations -- organizing resistance movements; supplying agents with money, weapons, and supplies; helping downed airmen to escape; offering safe houses and medical assistance to wounded agents and pilots.\"<ref>Gralley, pp 2-3, [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-1/virginia-halls-steps.html]</ref>   She fled France in November 1942 to avoid capture by the Germans. \n\nShe returned to France as a wireless operator for the OSS in March 1944 and a member of the Saint network. Working in territory still occupied by the German army and mostly without the assistance of other OSS agents, she supplied arms, training, and direction to French resistance groups, called [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]], especially in [[Haute-Loire]] where the maquis cleared the department of German soldiers prior to the arrival of the American army in September 1944. \n\nThe Germans gave her the nickname ''Artemis,'' and the [[Gestapo]] reportedly considered her \"the most dangerous of all Allied spies.\"<ref>Meyer, Roger (October 2008). \"World War II's Most Dangerous Spy\" ''The American Legion Magazine'' p. 54</ref> Hall had an artificial foot she named \"Cuthbert.\" She was also known as \"the limping lady.\" \n{{quote box\n| align=right\n| width=35%\n| quote=Virginia Hall left no memoir, granted no interviews, and spoke little about her overseas life--even with relatives.

She wanted to finish her studies in Europe, so she traveled the Continent and studied in France, Germany, and Austria, finally landing an appointment as a Consular Service clerk at the American Embassy in [[Warsaw]], Poland in 1931. A few months later she transferred to Smyrna, known later as [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]].  In 1932, she tripped and accidentally shot herself in the left foot while hunting birds. Her leg was amputated below the knee and replaced with a wooden appendage which she named \"Cuthbert\". After losing her leg, she worked again as a consular clerk in [[Venice]] and in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].<ref>Purnell, Sonia (2019), ''A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II,'' New York: Viking, p. 12-21.</ref>\n\nHall made several attempts to become a diplomat with the [[United States Foreign Service]], but women were rarely hired. In 1937, she was turned down by the [[Department of State]] because of an obscure rule against hiring people with disabilities as diplomats. Even an appeal for her to be hired to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], himself disabled,  was unheeded. She resigned from the [[Department of State]] in March 1939, still a consular clerk.<ref>Purnell, pp. 19-20</ref> \n\n==World War II==\nEarly in World War II in February 1940, Hall became an ambulance driver for the army of France.  After the defeat of France in June 1940, she made her way to [[Spain]] where, by chance, she met a British intelligence officer named George Bellows. Bellows was impressed with her and gave her the telephone number of a \"friend\" who might be able to help her find employment in [[England]]. The friend was [[Nicolas Bodington]], who worked for the newly-created Special Operations Executive (SOE).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Purnell, pp. 13-29</ref>\n\n==Special Operations Executive==\nHall joined the SOE in April 1941 and after training arrived in [[Vichy France]], unoccupied by Germany and nominally independent at that time, on August 23, 1941. She was the second female agent to be sent to France by SOE's F (France) Section, and the first to remain there for a lengthy period of time. (SOE F section would send 42 female agents to France during World War II, of whom 26 would survive the war.)<ref>Foot, pp. 465-469. Estimates of the number of SOE's female agents differ; 42 is the number listed by Foot, the official historian of the SOE.</ref> Hall's cover was as a reporter for the [[New York Post]] which gave her license to interview people, gather information and file stories filled with details useful to military planners. She based herself in [[Lyon]]. She turned away from her \"chic Parisian wardrobe\" to become inconspicuous and often quickly changed her appearance through make-up and disguise.<ref>Purnell, pp. 39-40, 46-47</ref> \n[[File:Les Marguerites Fleuriront ce Soir - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|''Les Marguerites Fleuriront ce Soir'' by Jeffrey W. Bass|thumb|right|200px|Hall was a wireless operator during her second mission to France.]]\nHall was a pioneer as a World War II secret agent and had to learn on her own the \"exacting tasks of being available, arranging contacts, recommending who to bribe and where to hide, soothing the jagged nerves of agents on the run and supervising the distribution of wireless sets.\"<ref>Foot, p. 171</ref> The network (or circuit) of SOE agents she founded was named [[SOE F Section networks#Stationer|Heckler]].<ref>Gralley, p. 2. [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-1/virginia-halls-steps.html]</ref> Among her recruits was gynecologist Jean Rousset and Germaine Gu\u00e9rin, the owner of a prominent brothel in Lyon. Gu\u00e9rin made several [[safe house|safehouse]]s available to Hall and passed along tidbits of information she and her female employees heard from German officers visiting the brothel.<ref>Purnell, pp. 59-62</ref> \n\nThe official historian of the SOE, M.R.D Foot, said that the motto of every successful secret agent was \"''dubito, ergo sum''\" (\"I doubt, therefore I survive.\").<ref>Foot, p. 311</ref> Hall's lengthy tenure in France without being arrested illustrates her caution. In October 1941, she sensed danger and declined to attend a meeting of SOE agents in [[Marseille]] which the French police raided and captured a dozen agents. After that debacle, Hall was one of the few SOE agents still at large in France and the only one with a means of transmitting information to London. George Whittinghill, an American diplomat in Lyon, allowed her to smuggle reports and letters to London in the diplomatic pouch.<ref>Purnell, pp. 47, 52-53</ref>    \n\nThe winter of 1941-42 was miserable for Hall. In a letter she said that if SOE would send her a piece of soap she would be \"both very happy and much cleaner.\"  In the absence of an SOE wireless operator her access to the American diplomatic pouch was the only means the few agents left at large in France had of communicating with London.  She continued building contacts in southern France and she assisted in the brief missions of SOE agents [[Peter Churchill]] and [[Benjamin Cowburn]] and earned high compliments from both. She avoided contact with an SOE agent sent to Lyon named [[Georges Duboudin]] and refused to introduce him to her contacts.  She regarded him as amateurish and lax in security.  When SOE headquarters directed that Duboudin should supervise her, she told SOE to \"lay off.\"  She also avoided contact with [[Philippe de Vom\u00e9court]], who, although an authentic French Resistance leader, was lax in security and grandiose.<ref>Purnell, pp. 69-89, 99-100.</ref>          \n\nAnother task Hall took on was helping British airmen, shot down or crashed over Europe, escape and return to England. Downed airmen who found their way to Lyon were told to go to the American Consulate and say they were a \"friend of Olivier.\" \"Olivier\" was Hall and she, with the help of brothel-owner Guerrin and other friends, hid, fed, and helped dozens of airmen escape France to neutral [[Spain]] and hence back to England.<ref>Purnell, p. 64</ref>   \n\nThe French nicknamed her \"la dame qui boite\" and the Germans put \"the limping lady\" on their most wanted list.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===The Jailbreak===\nHall learned that the 12 agents arrested by the French police in October 1941 were incarcerated at the Mauzac prison near [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]]. Wireless operator [[Georges B\u00e9gu\u00e9]] smuggled out letters to Hall from the prison and she recruited Gaby Bloch, wife of the prisoner [[Jean-Pierre Bloch]], as an ally to plan an escape.  Bloch visited the prison frequently to bring food and other items to her husband, including tins of sardines. The tools she smuggled in and the sardine tins enabled B\u00e9gu\u00e9 to make a key to the door of the barracks where the prisoners were kept.  Hall, too well known to visit the prison, assembled safe houses, vehicles, and helpers. A priest smuggled in a radio to B\u00e9gu\u00e9, and from within the prison, he began transmitting to London.  On July 15, 1942, the prisoners escaped and, after hiding in the woods while an intense manhunt took place, all of them met up with Hall in Lyon by August 11. From there, they were smuggled to Spain and thence back to England.<ref>Purnell, pp. 113-126</ref>  The official historian of SOE, [[M.R.D. Foot]] called the escape \"one of the war's most useful operations of its kind\", as several of the escapees would return to France and become leaders of SOE networks.<ref>Foot, pp. 203-204</ref>\n\n===Germans retaliate===\nThe Germans were furious about the escape from Mauzac prison and the laxity of the French police in allowing the escape. The Gestapo flooded Vichy France with 500 agents and the [[Abwehr]] also stepped up operations to infiltrate and destroy the fledgling French Resistance and the SOE networks. The Germans focused on Lyon, the epicenter of the resistance. Hall had counted on contacts she had with the French police to protect her, but, under pressure from the Germans, her police contacts were no longer reliable.<ref>Purnell, pp. 127-137</ref>\n\nIn May 1942, Hall had agreed to have messages from the [[R\u00e9seau Gloria|Gloria Network]], a French-run resistance movement based in Paris, transmitted to SOE in London. In August Gloria was infiltrated by a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and Abwehr agent named [[Robert Alesch]] and its leadership was captured by the Abwehr. Alesch also made contact with Hall in August, claiming to be an agent of Gloria and offering intelligence of apparently high value. She had doubts about Alesch, especially when she learned that Gloria had been destroyed, but was persuaded of his bona fides, as was the London headquarters of SOE. Alesch was able to penetrate Hall's network of contacts, including the capture of wireless operators and the sending of false messages to London in her name. <ref>Purnell 144-152</ref><ref>\"Gabrielle Jeanine Picabia,\" ''Musee de la Resistance,'' [http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media2761-Gabrielle-Jeanine-Picabia-chef-du-rA], accessed 29 Jan 2020</ref>\n\n===Escape===\nOn November 7, 1942, the American Consulate in Lyon told Hall that an allied invasion of [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] was imminent. In response to the invasion, on November 8, the Germans moved to [[Case Anton|occupy Vichy France]]. Hall anticipated correctly that the suppression of the Gestapo and Abwehr would become even more severe and she fled Lyon without telling anyone, including her closest contacts. She escaped by train from Lyon to [[Perpignan]], then, with a guide, walked over a 7,500 foot pass in the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain, covering up to 50 miles over two days in considerable discomfort.<ref>Gralley, p. 3-4.[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-1/virginia-halls-steps.html]</ref><ref>Purnell, pp. 158-159</ref> Hall had named her artificial foot \"Cuthbert\", and she signaled to SOE before her escape that she hoped that \"Cuthbert\" would not trouble her on the way. The SOE did not understand the reference and replied, \"If Cuthbert troublesome, eliminate him.\". After arriving in Spain, she was arrested by the Spanish authorities for illegally crossing the border, but the American Embassy eventually secured her release. She worked for SOE for a time in Madrid, then returned to London in July 1943 where she was quietly made an honorary [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613142626/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/oss/art05.htm|title=Special Operations|date=13 June 2007|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>\n\n==Office of Strategic Services==\n[[File:French identification certificate for Marcelle Montagne, an alias of OSS agent Virginia Hall.jpg|thumb|French identification certificate for \"Marcelle Montagne\" forged by OSS]]\n[[File:Haute-Loire-Position.svg|thumb|200px|right|From July to September 1944 Hall operated in Haute-Loire Department.]]\nOn her return to London, SOE leaders declined to send Hall back to France as an agent despite her requests.  She was compromised, they said, and too much at risk. However, she took a wireless course and contacted the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) about a job.  She was hired by the Special Operations Branch at the low rank and pay of a second lieutenant and on March 21, 1944 returned to France, arriving by motor gun boat at Beg-an-Fry in [[Brittany]]. Her artificial leg prevented her from parachuting. OSS provided her with a forged French identification card in the name of Marcelle Montagne. Her code name was Diane. The objective of the OSS teams was to arm and train the resistance groups, called [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], so they could support with sabotage and guerrilla activities the allied [[invasion of Normandy]], which would take place on June 6, 1944. <ref>Purnell, pp. 191-193, p. 197</ref><ref>Rossiter, Margaret L. (1986), ''Women in the Resistance,'' New York: Praeger, pp. 102-193</ref>   \n\nHall was disguised as an older woman, with gray hair and her teeth filed down to resemble that of a peasant woman. She disguised her limp with the shuffle of an old woman. Landing with her was Henri Lassot, 62 years old. Lassot was the organiser and leader of the new Saint network, it being too radical a thought that a woman could lead an SOE or OSS network of agents. She was Lassot's wireless operator. They were the fourth and fifth OSS agents to arrive in France. Lassot carried with him one million francs, equivalent to 5,000 British pounds; Hall had 500,000 francs with her. Hall quickly separated herself from Lassot whom she characterized as too talkative and a security risk, instructing her contacts not to tell him where she was. Aware that her accent would reveal that she was not French she engaged a French woman, Madame Rabut, to accompany and speak for her.<ref>Purnell, pp. 197-199, 203-206, 209</ref>  \n\nFrom March to July 1944, Hall roamed around France south of Paris, posing sometimes as an elderly milkmaid (and on one occasion selling cheese she had made to a group of German soldiers). She found and organized drop zones, established several safe houses, and made and renewed contacts, notably with Philippe de Vomecourt, in the Resistance.   She  organized and supplied with arms several resistance groups of a hundred men each in the [[Cher (department)|Cher]] and [[Cosne]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}. She attempted unsuccessfully to organize a jailbreak to gain freedom for her three nephews, captives of the Germans in Paris. Her resistance groups undertook many successful small-scale attacks on infrastructure and German soldiers.<ref>Purnell, pp 189, 207-208, 222-223.</ref><ref>\"Activity Report of Virginia Hall (Diane),\" F-Section, Heckler, [http://www.801492.org/Air%20Crew/Ewart/Saint-Heckler%20Reports.pdf], accessed 1 Feb 2020</ref>   \n\nHall was next given the job of helping the maquis in southern France harass the Germans in support of the allied invasion, [[Operation Dragoon]], of the south which would took place on August 15, 1944. In July, Hall was ordered to go to [[Haute-Loire]] department, arriving July 14, quitting her disguise, and establishing her headquarters in a barn near [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]]. As a woman and as a lowly second lieutenant she had problems asserting her authority over the maquis groups and the self-proclaimed colonels heading them. She complained to OSS headquarters, \"you send people out ostensibly to work with me and for me, but you do not give me the necessary authority.\"<ref>Rossiter, pp. 196-197</ref> She told the maquis leaders that she would finance them and give them arms on condition that they would be advised by her, but the prickly maquis leaders continued to be a problem for her. <ref>Hall, p. 1168, [http://www.801492.org/Air%20Crew/Ewart/Saint-Heckler%20Reports.pdf]</ref> The three planeloads of supplies she received in late July and the money she distributed for expenses gained their grudging acquiescence. \n\nThe three battalions of maquis (about 1,500 men) in her area undertook a number of successful sabotage operations. Now part of the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI), they forced the German occupiers to withdraw from [[Le Puy-en-Velay]] and head north with the rest of the retreating German forces. Belatedly, a [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] team, called Jeremy, of three men parachuted in on August 25 to undertake the training and supply of the battalions.<ref>Rossiter, pp. 195-196</ref> Hall commented wryly, \"this was after the Germans had been liquidated in the department of the Haute Loire and Le Puy liberated.\"<ref>Hall, p. 1169, [http://www.801492.org/Air%20Crew/Ewart/Saint-Heckler%20Reports.pdf]</ref>\n\nHall and several of the British and American military officers working for her left the Haute Loraine and arrived in Paris on September 22. The war was over for her.<ref>Purnell, p. 267</ref>\n\n==Post war and death==\nHall visited Lyon to learn the fate of the people who had worked for her there.  Her closest associates, brothel-owner Germaine Gu\u00e9rin and gynecologist Jean Rousset, had both been captured by the Germans and sent to concentration camps, but they survived.  She arranged 80,000 francs (400 British pounds) compensation from the [[United Kingdom]] for Gu\u00e9rin, but most of her other helpers received nothing. Many of the people she knew had not survived -- including her three nephews who had been executed at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].<ref>Purnell, pp. 281-282</ref> The German agent and priest, Robert Alesch, who had betrayed her network in Lyon was captured after the war and executed in Paris.<ref>\"Picabia,\" [http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media2761-Gabrielle-Jeanine-Picabia-chef-du-rA]</ref>\n\nWhile in Haute-Loire, Hall had met and fallen in love with an OSS lieutenant, Paul Goillot, who worked for her. He was eight years younger and six inches shorter than she was. In 1957, the couple married after living together off-and-on for years. She joined the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 1947, one of the first women hired by the new agency.  Her desk-bound job as an intelligence analyst was to gather information about Soviet penetration of European countries. She resigned in 1948 and then was rehired in 1950 for another lowly desk job. In 1951, she worked alongside Goillot as members of the [[Special Activities Division]] supporting undercover activities to prevent the spread of communism in Europe. During the 1950s, she received poor performance reports from her superiors. A colleague, [[E. Howard Hunt]], of [[Watergate]] fame, said \"No one knew what to do with her...She was a sort of embarrassment to the noncombat CIA types, by which I mean bureaucrats.\" In 1966, she retired, at the mandatory retirement age of 60.<ref>Purnell, pp. 257, 291, 294-295, 300-305</ref>   \n\nHall and her husband, Paul, retired to a farm in [[Barnesville, Maryland]] where she lived until her death on July 8, 1982. Her husband survived her for five years.<ref>Purnell, pp. 307, 311</ref> She is buried in the Druid Ridge Cemetery, [[Pikesville]], Maryland.<ref>\"Virginia Hall,\" [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14354228/virginia-hall], accessed 1 Feb 2020</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nFor Virginia Hall's efforts in France, \nGeneral [[William Joseph Donovan]] personally awarded Hall a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] in September 1945 in recognition of her efforts in France, the only one awarded to a civilian woman in World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/index.html?dod-date=512 |title=Today's Document from the National Archives |website=Archives.gov |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019001316/http://blogs.archives.gov/todaysdocument/2011/05/12/may-12-virginia-hall-of-the-oss/|title=Today's Document \u00bb May 12 \u2013 Virginia Hall of the OSS|date=19 October 2011|publisher=archives.gov}}</ref> President Truman wanted a public award of the medal, but Hall demurred, stating that she was \"still operational and most anxious to get busy.\" She was made an honorary Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE), and was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] with Palme by France.<ref name=\"WaPo\">{{cite news |last1=Shapira |first1=Ian |title=The Nazis were closing in on a spy known as \u2018The Limping Lady.\u2019 She fled across mountains on a wooden leg. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/07/11/the-nazis-were-closing-in-on-a-spy-known-as-the-limping-lady-she-fled-across-mountains-on-a-wooden-leg/ |accessdate=3 March 2019 |agency=washingtonpost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |date=11 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/07/11/the-nazis-were-closing-in-on-a-spy-known-as-the-limping-lady-she-fled-across-mountains-on-a-wooden-leg/ |archivedate=3 March 2019 |language=English}}</ref> \n\nHall's refusal to talk and write about her World War II experiences resulted in her slipping into obscurity during her lifetime, but her death \"triggered a new curiosity\" which persisted into the 21st century.<ref>Purnell, p. 307</ref> The French and British ambassadors in Washington honored her  in 2006, on the 100th anniversary of her birth.<ref name=\"baltimoresun\">{{cite news |last1=Tucker |first1=Abigail |title=A spy gets her due |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2006-12-14-0612140077-story.html |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=December 14, 2006}}</ref> In 2016, a CIA field agent training facility was named the Virginia Hall Expeditionary Center.<ref name=\"purnell\">{{cite book |last1=Purnell |first1=Sonia |title=A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780735225305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJBfDwAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> The CIA Museum gives five operatives individual sections in its catalog.

Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.\n\nDuring May, June, and July, the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer [[month]]s, which increases the [[solar flux]]. However, due to [[seasonal lag]], June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nSeasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around [[planting]] and [[harvest]] times, and the change of seasons was often attended by [[ritual]]. In [[temperate]] and [[Subpolar climate|sub-polar]] regions, four seasons based on the [[Gregorian calendar]] are generally recognized: ''[[Spring (season)|spring]]'', ''[[summer]]'', ''[[autumn]]'' or ''fall'', and ''[[winter]]''. The definition of seasons is also cultural. In India from the ancient times, six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] based on south Asian religious or cultural calendars are recognised and identified even today for the purposes such as agriculture and trade. Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate [[climate]] regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: ''prevernal'', ''vernal'', ''estival'', ''serotinal'', ''autumnal'', and ''hibernal''. Many tropical regions have two seasons: the ''[[wet season|rainy]]'', ''[[wet season|wet]]'', or ''[[monsoon]] season'' and the ''[[dry season]]''. Some have a third ''cool'', ''mild'', or ''[[harmattan]] season''. \n\nIn some parts of the world, some other \"seasons\" capture the timing of important ecological events such as ''[[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]]'', ''[[tornado season]]'', and ''[[wildfire]] season''.{{citation needed|reason=This content does not appear anywhere in the article body.|date=June 2016}} The most historically important of these are the three seasons\u2014''[[Akhet (season)|flood]]'', ''[[Season of the Emergence|growth]]'', and ''[[Shemu|low water]]''\u2014which were previously defined by the [[flooding of the Nile|former annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]].[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical dry season in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical wet season/monsoon in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{main|Effect of sun angle on climate}}\n\n===Axial tilt===\n[[File:Seasonearth.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Illumination of Earth at each change of astronomical season]]\n\n[[File:seasons.svg|frame|right|'''Fig. 1'''<br />This diagram shows how the tilt of [[Earth's axis]] aligns with incoming [[sunlight]] around the [[winter solstice]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\n\nThe seasons result from the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] being [[axial tilt#Earth|tilted]] with respect to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] by an angle of approximately 23.4 [[degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraiser|title=Tilt of the Earth|url=http://www.universetoday.com/26778/tilt-of-the-earth/|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> (This tilt is also known as \"obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]\".)\n\nRegardless of the time of year, the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s always experience opposite seasons. This is because during [[summer]] or [[winter]], one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see ''Fig. 1'') than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. For approximately half of the year (from around March 20 to around September 22), the Northern Hemisphere tips toward the Sun, with the maximum amount occurring on about June 21. For the other half of the year, the same happens, but in the Southern Hemisphere instead of the Northern, with the maximum around December 21. The two instants when the Sun is directly overhead at the [[Equator]] are the [[equinox]]es. Also at that moment, both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] of the Earth are just on the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], and hence day and night are equally divided between the two hemispheres. Around the [[March equinox]], the Northern Hemisphere will be experiencing [[Spring (season)|spring]] as the hours of [[daylight]] increase, and the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing [[autumn]] as daylight hours shorten.\n\nThe effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in [[day length]] and [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of the Sun at solar [[noon]] (the Sun's [[culmination]]) during the [[year]]. The low angle of Sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are [[effect of sun angle on climate|spread over a larger area]] of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity. Between this effect and the shorter daylight hours, the axial tilt of the Earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Earth-lighting-summer-solstice EN - corrected.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the northern solstice.\nFile:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the southern solstice.\nFile:North season.jpg|Diagram of the Earth's seasons as seen from the north.

The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the Sun because of its [[elliptical orbit]].<ref>\"Fundamentals of physical geography\", ''PhysicalGeography.net'', Ch. 6: Energy and Matter:(h) Earth-Sun Geometry, [http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6h.html]</ref> In fact, Earth reaches [[perihelion]] (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches [[aphelion]] (the point farthest from the Sun) in July, so the slight contribution of [[orbital eccentricity]] opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\">Phillips, Tony, \"[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/02jul_aphelion.htm The Distant Sun (Strange but True: the Sun is far away on the 4th of July)],\" [https://science.nasa.gov/default.htm Science@NASA], downloaded 24 June 2006</ref> In general, the effect of orbital eccentricity on Earth's seasons is a 7% variation in sunlight received.\n\nOrbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when ''farther'' from the sun. This is because the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Southern, and land warms more readily than sea.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\"/>\nAny noticeable intensification of southern winters and summers due to Earth's elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tony|title=Earth at Perihelion|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast04jan_1/|work=Science News|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Maritime and hemispheric===\nSeasonal weather fluctuations (changes) also depend on factors such as proximity to [[ocean]]s or other large bodies of water, [[ocean current|currents]] in those oceans, [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]]/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing [[wind]]s.\n\nIn the [[temperate]] and [[polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], seasons are marked by changes in the amount of [[sunlight]], which in turn often causes [[biological life cycle|cycles]] of dormancy in plants and [[hibernation]] in animals. These effects vary with [[latitude]] and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the [[South Pole]] is in the middle of the continent of [[Antarctica]] and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The [[North Pole]] is in the [[Arctic Ocean]], and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.\n\nThe seasonal cycle in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that of the other. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern, and vice versa.\n\n===Tropics===\n[[Image:BlueMarble monthlies animation.gif|thumb|right|Animation of seasonal differences especially [[snow]] cover through the year]]\nThe [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions see little annual fluctuation of sunlight.  However, seasonal shifts occur along a rainy, low-pressure belt called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ICZ). As a result, the amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature. When the Zone is north of the Equator, the northern tropics experience their wet season while the southern tropics have their dry season. This pattern reverses when the Zone migrates to a position south of the Equator.\n\n===Mid-latitude thermal lag===\n\nIn meteorological terms, the [[solstice]]s (the maximum and minimum [[insolation]]) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter. The heights of these seasons occur up to 7 weeks later because of [[seasonal lag]]. Seasons, though, are not always defined in meteorological terms.\n\nIn [[astronomy|astronomical]] reckoning by hours of [[daylight]] alone, the solstices and [[equinox]]es are in the ''middle'' of the respective seasons. Because of seasonal lag due to [[thermal absorption]] and release by the oceans, regions with a [[continental climate]], which predominate in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], often consider these four dates to be the ''start'' of the seasons as in the diagram, with the [[cross-quarter day]]s considered seasonal midpoints. The length of these seasons is not uniform because of Earth's [[elliptical orbit]] and its [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|different speeds along that orbit]].<ref>\"[http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/antwoorden/seizoenen.html#v466 Astronomy Answers AstronomyAnswerBook: Seasons],\" Astronomical Institute, Utrecht University, downloaded 1 August 2008</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Reckoning}}Four-season calendar reckoning==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Accordingly, if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area, it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer.  Additionally, the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another.  \n\n===''Official'' seasons===\nAs noted, a variety of dates and even exact times are used in different countries or regions to mark changes of the calendar seasons.

In 1780 the Societas Meteorologica Palatina (which became defunct in 1795), an early international organization for meteorology, defined seasons as groupings of three whole months as identified by the Gregorian calendar. Ever since, professional meteorologists all over the world have used this definition.<ref>{{citation|title=Begin van de lente (Start of Spring)|work=|publisher=KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorology Institute)|date=2009-03-20|url=http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/22141/begin_van_de_lente|format=Dutch|doi=|accessdate=2009-03-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327085605/http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/22141/begin_van_de_lente|archivedate=2009-03-27|df=}}</ref>\nTherefore, for temperate areas in the northern hemisphere, spring begins on 1 March, summer on 1 June, autumn on 1 September, and winter on 1 December.

Spring begins when the daily averaged temperature permanently rises above 0 \u00b0C, summer begins when the temperature permanently rises above +10 \u00b0C, summer ends when the temperature permanently falls below +10 \u00b0C and winter begins when the temperature permanently falls below 0 \u00b0C. \"Permanently\" here means that the daily averaged temperature has remained above or below the limit for seven consecutive days. This implies two things: first, the seasons do not begin at fixed dates but must be determined by observation and are known only after the fact; and second, a new season begins at different dates in different parts of the country.   \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:800px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Surface air temperature]]\n|-\n|<!--col1--> [[File:Surface air temperature global.jpg|400px|right]]\n|<!--col2--> [[File:Jones et al.

The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around {{Convert|10|\u2013|15|C|F}} in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around {{Convert|20|\u2013|25|C|F}} in mainland India's southeast.\n* '''Summer''' or '''pre-monsoon''' season, lasting from March to May. In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions of India, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around {{Convert|32|\u2013|40|C|F}} in most of the interior.\n* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.\n* '''Post-monsoon''' or '''autumn''' season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.\n\n===Astronomical===\n{{solstice-equinox}}\nAstronomical timing as the basis for designating the temperate seasons dates back at least to the [[Julian calendar]] used by the ancient Romans.  It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn for the [[solstice]]s and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the [[equinox]]es, or a traditional date close to these times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php|title=Earth's Seasons|publisher=The United States Naval Observatory (USNO)|date=September 21, 2015|website=Astronomical Applications Department|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of [[apsides]] of Earth's elliptical orbit.  The orbital ellipse (with eccentricity exaggerated for effect) goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (periapsis\u2014nearest point to the sun) on anywhere from 2 January to 5 January, the point of March equinox on 19, 20 or 21 March, the point of June solstice on 20 or 21 June, the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] (apoapsis\u2014farthest point from the sun) on anywhere from 4 July to 7 July, the September equinox on 22 or 23 September, and the December solstice on 21 or 22 December.\n\n[[File:Seasons1.svg|thumb|center|middle|upright=3|alt=Illustration of seasonal distances from Earth to the Sun|Note: Distances are exaggerated and not to scale]]\n\nThese \"astronomical\" seasons are not of equal length, because of the [[ellipse|elliptical nature]] of the orbit of the Earth, as discovered by [[Johannes Kepler]].  From the March equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the June solstice, then 93.65 days until the September equinox, 89.85 days until the December solstice and finally 88.99 days until the March equinox.\n\n====Variation due to calendar misalignment====\n\nThe times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern Gregorian calendar, but fall about six hours later every year, amounting to one full day in four years. They are reset by the occurrence of a leap year. The Gregorian calendar is designed to keep the March equinox no later than 21 March as accurately as is practical. ''Also see: [[Gregorian calendar#Calendar seasonal error|Gregorian calendar seasonal error]].''\n\nThe calendar equinox (used in the calculation of Easter) is 21 March, the same date as in the Easter tables current at the time of the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.   The calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 March.   From Nicaea to the date of the reform, the years 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500, which would not have been leap years in the Gregorian calendar, amount to nine days, but astronomers directed that ten days be removed.\n\nCurrently, the most common equinox and solstice dates are March 20, June 21, September 22 or 23 and December 21; the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses.   This shift is a full day in about 128 years (compensated mainly by the century \"leap year\" rules of the Gregorian calendar) and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century, when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late.   This also means that in many years of the twentieth century, the dates of March 21, June 22, September 23 and December 22 were much more common, so older books teach (and older people may still remember) these dates.\n\nNote that all the times are given in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (roughly speaking, the time at [[Greenwich]], ignoring [[British Summer Time]]). People living farther to the east (Asia and Australia), whose local times are in advance, will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later; for example, in [[Tonga]] (UTC+13), an equinox occurred on September 24, 1999, a date which will not crop up again until 2103. On the other hand, people living far to the west (America) whose clocks run behind UTC may experience an equinox as early as March 19.\n\n====Change over time====\nOver thousands of years, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and orbital eccentricity vary (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).   The equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward.   Thus, ten thousand years from now Earth's northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion. The severity of seasonal change \u2014 the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location \u2014 will also change over time because the Earth's axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.\n\nSmaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the Moon and the other planets.\n\n===Solar===\n[[File:Phases of the Sun (NHemi).png|thumb|right|The annual cycle of insolation (Sun energy, shown in blue) with key points for seasons (middle), [[quarter days]] (top) and [[cross-quarter days]] (bottom) along with months (lower) and Zodiac houses (upper).  The cycle of temperature (shown in pink) is delayed by [[seasonal lag]].]]\n\nSolar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons.  It was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval Europe, especially by the [[Celts]], and is still ceremonially observed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and some East Asian countries. Summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least.\n\nThe solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days, which are about 3\u20134 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 6\u20137 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices.  Thus, the day of greatest insolation is designated \"midsummer\" as noted in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which is set on the summer solstice.  On the [[Celtic calendar]], the start of the seasons corresponds to four [[Pagan]] agricultural festivals - the traditional first day of winter is 1 November ([[Samhain]], the Celtic origin of [[Halloween]]); spring starts 1 February ([[Imbolc]], the Celtic origin of [[Groundhog Day]]); summer begins 1 May ([[Beltane]], the Celtic origin of [[May Day]]); the first day of autumn is 1 August (Celtic [[Lughnasadh]]).\n\n==Other season calendar reckoning==\n===Six Seasons===\n\nSome calendars in south Asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three. The dates are fixed at even intervals of months.\n\nIn the [[Hindu calendar]] of tropical and subtropical India, there are six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates: [[Vasanta (Ritu)|Vasanta]] (spring), Greeshma (summer), [[Ritu (Indian season)|Varsha]] ([[monsoon]]), [[Sharad]] (autumn), Hemanta (early winter), and Shishira (prevernal or late winter). The six seasons are ascribed to two months each of the twelve months in the Hindu calendar. The rough correspondences are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Hindu season\n! Start\n! End\n!

So, if we can observe a change in daily floral/animal events, the season is changing.  In this sense, ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms, unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative.  If specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season don't normally occur in a particular region, then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis. In Great Britain, the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) in a defined sequence of days.   This almost always occurred in March.   However, with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter.\n\n===Modern mid-latitude ecological===\nSix ecological seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons.<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}</ref> [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Group D: Continental/microthermal climates|continental climates]]. Conversely, prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near oceanic and coastal areas. For example, prevernal [[crocus]] blooms typically appear as early as February in coastal areas of [[British Columbia]], the [[British Isles]], but generally don't appear until March or April in locations like the [[Midwest]] USA or parts of eastern [[Europe]]. The actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next.  Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere:\n* '''Prevernal''' (early or pre-spring): Begins February (mild temperate), to March (cool temperate). Deciduous tree buds begin to swell. Some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats.\n* '''Vernal''' (spring): Begins mid March (mild temperate), to late April (cool temperate). Tree buds burst into leaves. Birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting.\n* '''Estival''' (high summer): Begins June in most temperate climates. Trees in full leaf. Birds hatch and raise offspring.\n* '''Serotinal''' (late summer): Generally begins mid to late August. Deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations (above 45 north). Young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration.  The traditional \"harvest season\" begins by early September.\n* '''Autumnal''' (autumn): Generally begins mid to late September. Tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground. Birds migrate back to wintering areas.\n* '''Hibernal''' (winter): Begins December (mild temperate), November (cool temperate). Deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay. Migrating birds settled in winter habitats.\n\n===Indigenous ecological===\n{{See also|Indigenous Australian seasons}}\nIndigenous people in polar, temperate and tropical climates of northern Eurasia, the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants, animals and weather around them. Each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the [[growing season]]s of plants in the tropical rainforests.  In Australia, some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year,<ref name=\"Australian weather and the seasons\"/> as do the Sami people in Scandinavia. Many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles, now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region.\n\nThe [[Noongar]] people of South-West Western Australia recognise maar-keyen bonar,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CurtinX+CAS1x+2T2018/8eac4c85693d418e9edc2a39081723de/ |title=Noongar Glossary |publisher=Courses.edx.org |date= |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref> or six seasons.

For example, in [[Nicaragua]] the dry season (November to April) is called \"summer\" and the rainy season (May to October) is called \"winter\", even though it is located in the northern hemisphere. There is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year. However, many regions (such as the northern [[Indian ocean]]) are subject to [[monsoon]] [[rain]] and wind cycles.\n\nFloral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wet/dry cycles than seasonal temperature variations, with different species flowering (or emerging from cocoons) at specific times before, during, or after the monsoon season. Thus, the tropics are characterized by numerous \"mini-seasons\" within the larger seasonal blocks of time.\n\n\n===Polar===\nAny point north of the [[Arctic Circle]] or south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] will have one period in the summer called \"polar day\" when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter called 'polar night' when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the maximum periods of \"[[midnight sun]]\" and \"[[polar night]]\" are progressively longer.\n\nFor example, at the military and weather station [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] located at 82\u00b030\u203205\u2033N and 62\u00b020\u203220\u2033W, on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Canada]] (about 450 [[nautical mile]]s or 830 km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of February and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer; by 21 March, the sun is up for over 12 hours. On 6 April the sun rises at 0522 [[UTC]] and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 September at 0335 UTC.  By October 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes, and on October 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/|title=U.S. Naval Observatory|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018}}\n</ref>\n\nFirst light comes in late January because the sky has [[twilight]], being a glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon. From mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight.\n\nIn the weeks surrounding 21 June, in the northern polar region, the sun is at its highest elevation, appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of October, when it disappears for the last time until the following February. For a few more weeks, \"day\" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, from mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight and it is continuously dark. In mid January the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of February, then on 6 April the sun remains above the horizon until mid October.\n\n===Military campaigning seasons===\nSeasonal weather and climate conditions can become important in the context of military operations.\n\nFor navies, the presence of accessible ports and bases can allow naval operations during certain (variable) seasons of the year. The availability of [[ice-free harbor | ice-free]] or [[warm-water port]]s can make navies much more effective. Thus [[Russia]], historically navally constrained when confined to using [[Arkhangelsk]] (before the 18th century) and even [[Kronstadt]], has particular interests in maintaining and in preserving access to [[Baltiysk]], [[Vladivostok]], and [[Sevastopol]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | editor1-last = Stokke\n | editor1-first = Olav Schram\n | editor2-last = Tunander\n | editor2-first = Ola\n | editor2-link = Ola Tunander\n | editor3-last = Nansen\n | editor3-first = Fridtjof\n | editor3-link = Fridtjof Nansen\n | title = The Barents region: cooperation in Arctic Europe\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KZ9mAAAAMAAJ\n | series = International Peace Research Institute, Oslo Prio Series\n | volume = 10\n | publisher = SAGE\n | date = 1994\n | page = 98\n | edition = reprint\n | access-date = 21 August 2019\n | quote = Witte wanted the main base of the Russian Navy to be situated at a location where waters were ice-free the whole year round [...].\n| isbn = 9780803978973\n }}\n</ref>\nStorm seasons or polar winter-weather conditions can inhibit surface warships at sea.\n\nPre-modern armies, especially in Europe, tended to campaign in the summer months - peasant [[conscription | conscripts]] tended to melt away at [[harvest time]], nor did it make economic sense in an agricultural society to neglect the [[sowing]] season.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | chapter = Games and war in Ancient Greece: Discussion\n | editor1-last = Cornell\n | editor1-first = Tim J.\n | editor1-link = Tim Cornell\n | editor2-last = Allen\n | editor2-first = Thomas B.\n | title = War and Games\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nQAXzSJsqKcC\n | series = Studies on the nature of war\n | volume = 3\n | location = Woodbridge, Suffolk\n | publisher = Boydell Press\n | date = 2002\n | page = 34\n | isbn = 9780851158709\n | access-date = 21 August 2019\n | quote = The warriors are farmers and the farmers are warriors, so you have to time your war in relation to the harvest and to other agricultural events.

Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.\n\nDuring May, June, and July, the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer [[month]]s, which increases the [[solar flux]]. However, due to [[seasonal lag]], June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nSeasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around [[planting]] and [[harvest]] times, and the change of seasons was often attended by [[ritual]]. In [[temperate]] and [[Subpolar climate|sub-polar]] regions, four seasons based on the [[Gregorian calendar]] are generally recognized: ''[[Spring (season)|spring]]'', ''[[summer]]'', ''[[autumn]]'' or ''fall'', and ''[[winter]]''. The definition of seasons is also cultural. In India from the ancient times, six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] based on south Asian religious or cultural calendars are recognised and identified even today for the purposes such as agriculture and trade. Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate [[climate]] regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: ''prevernal'', ''vernal'', ''estival'', ''serotinal'', ''autumnal'', and ''hibernal''. Many tropical regions have two seasons: the ''[[wet season|rainy]]'', ''[[wet season|wet]]'', or ''[[monsoon]] season'' and the ''[[dry season]]''. Some have a third ''cool'', ''mild'', or ''[[harmattan]] season''. \n\nIn some parts of the world, some other \"seasons\" capture the timing of important ecological events such as ''[[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]]'', ''[[tornado season]]'', and ''[[wildfire]] season''.{{citation needed|reason=This content does not appear anywhere in the article body.|date=June 2016}} The most historically important of these are the three seasons\u2014''[[Akhet (season)|flood]]'', ''[[Season of the Emergence|growth]]'', and ''[[Shemu|low water]]''\u2014which were previously defined by the [[flooding of the Nile|former annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]].[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical dry season in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical wet season/monsoon in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{main|Effect of sun angle on climate}}\n\n===Axial tilt===\n[[File:Seasonearth.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Illumination of Earth at each change of astronomical season]]\n\n[[File:seasons.svg|frame|right|'''Fig. 1'''<br />This diagram shows how the tilt of [[Earth's axis]] aligns with incoming [[sunlight]] around the [[winter solstice]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\n\nThe seasons result from the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] being [[axial tilt#Earth|tilted]] with respect to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] by an angle of approximately 23.4 [[degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraiser|title=Tilt of the Earth|url=http://www.universetoday.com/26778/tilt-of-the-earth/|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> (This tilt is also known as \"obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]\".)\n\nRegardless of the time of year, the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s always experience opposite seasons. This is because during [[summer]] or [[winter]], one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see ''Fig. 1'') than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. For approximately half of the year (from around March 20 to around September 22), the Northern Hemisphere tips toward the Sun, with the maximum amount occurring on about June 21. For the other half of the year, the same happens, but in the Southern Hemisphere instead of the Northern, with the maximum around December 21. The two instants when the Sun is directly overhead at the [[Equator]] are the [[equinox]]es. Also at that moment, both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] of the Earth are just on the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], and hence day and night are equally divided between the two hemispheres. Around the [[March equinox]], the Northern Hemisphere will be experiencing [[Spring (season)|spring]] as the hours of [[daylight]] increase, and the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing [[autumn]] as daylight hours shorten.\n\nThe effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in [[day length]] and [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of the Sun at solar [[noon]] (the Sun's [[culmination]]) during the [[year]]. The low angle of Sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are [[effect of sun angle on climate|spread over a larger area]] of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity. Between this effect and the shorter daylight hours, the axial tilt of the Earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Earth-lighting-summer-solstice EN - corrected.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the northern solstice.\nFile:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the southern solstice.\nFile:North season.jpg|Diagram of the Earth's seasons as seen from the north.

The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the Sun because of its [[elliptical orbit]].<ref>\"Fundamentals of physical geography\", ''PhysicalGeography.net'', Ch. 6: Energy and Matter:(h) Earth-Sun Geometry, [http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6h.html]</ref> In fact, Earth reaches [[perihelion]] (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches [[aphelion]] (the point farthest from the Sun) in July, so the slight contribution of [[orbital eccentricity]] opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\">Phillips, Tony, \"[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/02jul_aphelion.htm The Distant Sun (Strange but True: the Sun is far away on the 4th of July)],\" [https://science.nasa.gov/default.htm Science@NASA], downloaded 24 June 2006</ref> In general, the effect of orbital eccentricity on Earth's seasons is a 7% variation in sunlight received.\n\nOrbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when ''farther'' from the sun. This is because the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Southern, and land warms more readily than sea.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\"/>\nAny noticeable intensification of southern winters and summers due to Earth's elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tony|title=Earth at Perihelion|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast04jan_1/|work=Science News|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Maritime and hemispheric===\nSeasonal weather fluctuations (changes) also depend on factors such as proximity to [[ocean]]s or other large bodies of water, [[ocean current|currents]] in those oceans, [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]]/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing [[wind]]s.\n\nIn the [[temperate]] and [[polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], seasons are marked by changes in the amount of [[sunlight]], which in turn often causes [[biological life cycle|cycles]] of dormancy in plants and [[hibernation]] in animals. These effects vary with [[latitude]] and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the [[South Pole]] is in the middle of the continent of [[Antarctica]] and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The [[North Pole]] is in the [[Arctic Ocean]], and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.\n\nThe seasonal cycle in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that of the other. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern, and vice versa.\n\n===Tropics===\n[[Image:BlueMarble monthlies animation.gif|thumb|right|Animation of seasonal differences especially [[snow]] cover through the year]]\nThe [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions see little annual fluctuation of sunlight.  However, seasonal shifts occur along a rainy, low-pressure belt called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ICZ). As a result, the amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature. When the Zone is north of the Equator, the northern tropics experience their wet season while the southern tropics have their dry season. This pattern reverses when the Zone migrates to a position south of the Equator.\n\n===Mid-latitude thermal lag===\n\nIn meteorological terms, the [[solstice]]s (the maximum and minimum [[insolation]]) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter. The heights of these seasons occur up to 7 weeks later because of [[seasonal lag]]. Seasons, though, are not always defined in meteorological terms.\n\nIn [[astronomy|astronomical]] reckoning by hours of [[daylight]] alone, the solstices and [[equinox]]es are in the ''middle'' of the respective seasons. Because of seasonal lag due to [[thermal absorption]] and release by the oceans, regions with a [[continental climate]], which predominate in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], often consider these four dates to be the ''start'' of the seasons as in the diagram, with the [[cross-quarter day]]s considered seasonal midpoints. The length of these seasons is not uniform because of Earth's [[elliptical orbit]] and its [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|different speeds along that orbit]].<ref>\"[http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/antwoorden/seizoenen.html#v466 Astronomy Answers AstronomyAnswerBook: Seasons],\" Astronomical Institute, Utrecht University, downloaded 1 August 2008</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Reckoning}}Four-season calendar reckoning==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Accordingly, if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area, it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer.  Additionally, the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another.  \n\n===''Official'' seasons===\nAs noted, a variety of dates and even exact times are used in different countries or regions to mark changes of the calendar seasons.

The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around {{Convert|10|\u2013|15|C|F}} in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around {{Convert|20|\u2013|25|C|F}} in mainland India's southeast.\n* '''Summer''' or '''pre-monsoon''' season, lasting from March to May. In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions of India, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around {{Convert|32|\u2013|40|C|F}} in most of the interior.\n* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.\n* '''Post-monsoon''' or '''autumn''' season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.\n\n===Astronomical===\n{{solstice-equinox}}\nAstronomical timing as the basis for designating the temperate seasons dates back at least to the [[Julian calendar]] used by the ancient Romans.  It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn for the [[solstice]]s and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the [[equinox]]es, or a traditional date close to these times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php|title=Earth's Seasons|publisher=The United States Naval Observatory (USNO)|date=September 21, 2015|website=Astronomical Applications Department|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of [[apsides]] of Earth's elliptical orbit.  The orbital ellipse (with eccentricity exaggerated for effect) goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (periapsis\u2014nearest point to the sun) on anywhere from 2 January to 5 January, the point of March equinox on 19, 20 or 21 March, the point of June solstice on 20 or 21 June, the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] (apoapsis\u2014farthest point from the sun) on anywhere from 4 July to 7 July, the September equinox on 22 or 23 September, and the December solstice on 21 or 22 December.\n\n[[File:Seasons1.svg|thumb|center|middle|upright=3|alt=Illustration of seasonal distances from Earth to the Sun|Note: Distances are exaggerated and not to scale]]\n\nThese \"astronomical\" seasons are not of equal length, because of the [[ellipse|elliptical nature]] of the orbit of the Earth, as discovered by [[Johannes Kepler]].  From the March equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the June solstice, then 93.65 days until the September equinox, 89.85 days until the December solstice and finally 88.99 days until the March equinox.\n\n====Variation due to calendar misalignment====\n\nThe times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern Gregorian calendar, but fall about six hours later every year, amounting to one full day in four years. They are reset by the occurrence of a leap year. The Gregorian calendar is designed to keep the March equinox no later than 21 March as accurately as is practical. ''Also see: [[Gregorian calendar#Calendar seasonal error|Gregorian calendar seasonal error]].''\n\nThe calendar equinox (used in the calculation of Easter) is 21 March, the same date as in the Easter tables current at the time of the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.   The calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 March.   From Nicaea to the date of the reform, the years 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500, which would not have been leap years in the Gregorian calendar, amount to nine days, but astronomers directed that ten days be removed.\n\nCurrently, the most common equinox and solstice dates are March 20, June 21, September 22 or 23 and December 21; the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses.   This shift is a full day in about 128 years (compensated mainly by the century \"leap year\" rules of the Gregorian calendar) and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century, when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late.   This also means that in many years of the twentieth century, the dates of March 21, June 22, September 23 and December 22 were much more common, so older books teach (and older people may still remember) these dates.\n\nNote that all the times are given in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (roughly speaking, the time at [[Greenwich]], ignoring [[British Summer Time]]). People living farther to the east (Asia and Australia), whose local times are in advance, will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later; for example, in [[Tonga]] (UTC+13), an equinox occurred on September 24, 1999, a date which will not crop up again until 2103. On the other hand, people living far to the west (America) whose clocks run behind UTC may experience an equinox as early as March 19.\n\n====Change over time====\nOver thousands of years, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and orbital eccentricity vary (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).   The equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward.   Thus, ten thousand years from now Earth's northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion. The severity of seasonal change \u2014 the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location \u2014 will also change over time because the Earth's axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.\n\nSmaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the Moon and the other planets.\n\n===Solar===\n[[File:Phases of the Sun (NHemi).png|thumb|right|The annual cycle of insolation (Sun energy, shown in blue) with key points for seasons (middle), [[quarter days]] (top) and [[cross-quarter days]] (bottom) along with months (lower) and Zodiac houses (upper).  The cycle of temperature (shown in pink) is delayed by [[seasonal lag]].]]\n\nSolar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons.  It was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval Europe, especially by the [[Celts]], and is still ceremonially observed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and some East Asian countries. Summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least.\n\nThe solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days, which are about 3\u20134 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 6\u20137 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices.  Thus, the day of greatest insolation is designated \"midsummer\" as noted in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which is set on the summer solstice.  On the [[Celtic calendar]], the start of the seasons corresponds to four [[Pagan]] agricultural festivals - the traditional first day of winter is 1 November ([[Samhain]], the Celtic origin of [[Halloween]]); spring starts 1 February ([[Imbolc]], the Celtic origin of [[Groundhog Day]]); summer begins 1 May ([[Beltane]], the Celtic origin of [[May Day]]); the first day of autumn is 1 August (Celtic [[Lughnasadh]]).\n\n==Other season calendar reckoning==\n===Six Seasons===\n\nSome calendars in south Asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three. The dates are fixed at even intervals of months.\n\nIn the [[Hindu calendar]] of tropical and subtropical India, there are six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates: [[Vasanta (Ritu)|Vasanta]] (spring), Greeshma (summer), [[Ritu (Indian season)|Varsha]] ([[monsoon]]), [[Sharad]] (autumn), Hemanta (early winter), and Shishira (prevernal or late winter). The six seasons are ascribed to two months each of the twelve months in the Hindu calendar. The rough correspondences are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Hindu season\n! Start\n! End\n!

So, if we can observe a change in daily floral/animal events, the season is changing.  In this sense, ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms, unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative.  If specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season don't normally occur in a particular region, then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis. In Great Britain, the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) in a defined sequence of days.   This almost always occurred in March.   However, with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter.\n\n===Modern mid-latitude ecological===\nSix ecological seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons.<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}</ref> [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Group D: Continental/microthermal climates|continental climates]]. Conversely, prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near oceanic and coastal areas. For example, prevernal [[crocus]] blooms typically appear as early as February in coastal areas of [[British Columbia]], the [[British Isles]], but generally don't appear until March or April in locations like the [[Midwest]] USA or parts of eastern [[Europe]]. The actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next.  Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere:\n* '''Prevernal''' (early or pre-spring): Begins February (mild temperate), to March (cool temperate). Deciduous tree buds begin to swell. Some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats.\n* '''Vernal''' (spring): Begins mid March (mild temperate), to late April (cool temperate). Tree buds burst into leaves. Birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting.\n* '''Estival''' (high summer): Begins June in most temperate climates. Trees in full leaf. Birds hatch and raise offspring.\n* '''Serotinal''' (late summer): Generally begins mid to late August. Deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations (above 45 north). Young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration.  The traditional \"harvest season\" begins by early September.\n* '''Autumnal''' (autumn): Generally begins mid to late September. Tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground. Birds migrate back to wintering areas.\n* '''Hibernal''' (winter): Begins December (mild temperate), November (cool temperate). Deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay. Migrating birds settled in winter habitats.\n\n===Indigenous ecological===\n{{See also|Indigenous Australian seasons}}\nIndigenous people in polar, temperate and tropical climates of northern Eurasia, the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants, animals and weather around them. Each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the [[growing season]]s of plants in the tropical rainforests.  In Australia, some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year,<ref name=\"Australian weather and the seasons\"/> as do the Sami people in Scandinavia. Many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles, now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region.\n\nThe [[Noongar]] people of South-West Western Australia recognise maar-keyen bonar,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CurtinX+CAS1x+2T2018/8eac4c85693d418e9edc2a39081723de/ |title=Noongar Glossary |publisher=Courses.edx.org |date= |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref> or six seasons.

The seasons also correlate to aspects of the human condition, intrinsically linking the lives of the people to the world that surrounds them and also dictating their movements, as with each season, various parts of country would be visited which were particularly abundant or safe from the elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.noongarculture.org.au/food/ |title=Kaartdijin Noongar |work=Noongarculture.org.au |date= |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Noongar season\n!Approximate Months\n!Cultural Parallel\n|-\n|Birak (First Summer)\n|December to January\n|Season of the Young\n|-\n|Bunuru (Second Summer)\n|February to March\n|Season of Adolescence\n|-\n|Djeran (Autumn)\n|April to May\n|Season of Adulthood\n|-\n|Makuru (The First Rains)\n|June to July\n|Fertility Season\n|-\n|Djilba (The Second Rains)\n|August to September\n|Season of Conception\n|-\n|Kambarang (Wildflower Season)\n|October to November\n|Season of Birth\n|}\n\n===Tropical===\n[[File:Diamond Head Hike - Wet & Dry Seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wet and dry seasons]]\nIn the tropics, where seasonal dates also vary, it is more common to speak of the [[wet season|rainy]] (or wet, or [[monsoon]]) season versus the [[dry season]]. For example, in [[Nicaragua]] the dry season (November to April) is called \"summer\" and the rainy season (May to October) is called \"winter\", even though it is located in the northern hemisphere. There is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year. However, many regions (such as the northern [[Indian ocean]]) are subject to [[monsoon]] [[rain]] and wind cycles.\n\nFloral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wet/dry cycles than seasonal temperature variations, with different species flowering (or emerging from cocoons) at specific times before, during, or after the monsoon season. Thus, the tropics are characterized by numerous \"mini-seasons\" within the larger seasonal blocks of time.\n\n\n===Polar===\nAny point north of the [[Arctic Circle]] or south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] will have one period in the summer called \"polar day\" when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter called 'polar night' when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the maximum periods of \"[[midnight sun]]\" and \"[[polar night]]\" are progressively longer.\n\nFor example, at the military and weather station [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] located at 82\u00b030\u203205\u2033N and 62\u00b020\u203220\u2033W, on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Canada]] (about 450 [[nautical mile]]s or 830 km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of February and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer; by 21 March, the sun is up for over 12 hours. On 6 April the sun rises at 0522 [[UTC]] and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 September at 0335 UTC.  By October 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes, and on October 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/|title=U.S. Naval Observatory|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018}}\n</ref>\n\nFirst light comes in late January because the sky has [[twilight]], being a glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon. From mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight.\n\nIn the weeks surrounding 21 June, in the northern polar region, the sun is at its highest elevation, appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of October, when it disappears for the last time until the following February. For a few more weeks, \"day\" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, from mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight and it is continuously dark. In mid January the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of February, then on 6 April the sun remains above the horizon until mid October.\n\n===Military campaigning seasons===\nSeasonal weather and climate conditions can become important in the context of military operations.\n\nFor navies, the presence of accessible ports and bases can allow naval operations during certain (variable) seasons of the year. The availability of [[ice-free harbor | ice-free]] or [[warm-water port]]s can make navies much more effective. Thus [[Russia]], historically navally constrained when confined to using [[Arkhangelsk]] (before the 18th century) and even [[Kronstadt]], has particular interests in maintaining and in preserving access to [[Baltiysk]], [[Vladivostok]], and [[Sevastopol]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | editor1-last = Stokke\n | editor1-first = Olav Schram\n | editor2-last = Tunander\n | editor2-first = Ola\n | editor2-link = Ola Tunander\n | editor3-last = Nansen\n | editor3-first = Fridtjof\n | editor3-link = Fridtjof Nansen\n | title = The Barents region: cooperation in Arctic Europe\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KZ9mAAAAMAAJ\n | series = International Peace Research Institute, Oslo Prio Series\n | volume = 10\n | publisher = SAGE\n | date = 1994\n | page = 98\n | edition = reprint\n | access-date = 21 August 2019\n | quote = Witte wanted the main base of the Russian Navy to be situated at a location where waters were ice-free the whole year round [...].\n| isbn = 9780803978973\n }}\n</ref>\nStorm seasons or polar winter-weather conditions can inhibit surface warships at sea.\n\nPre-modern armies, especially in Europe, tended to campaign in the summer months - peasant [[conscription | conscripts]] tended to melt away at [[harvest time]], nor did it make economic sense in an agricultural society to neglect the [[sowing]] season.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | chapter = Games and war in Ancient Greece: Discussion\n | editor1-last = Cornell\n | editor1-first = Tim J.\n | editor1-link = Tim Cornell\n | editor2-last = Allen\n | editor2-first = Thomas B.\n | title = War and Games\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nQAXzSJsqKcC\n | series = Studies on the nature of war\n | volume = 3\n | location = Woodbridge, Suffolk\n | publisher = Boydell Press\n | date = 2002\n | page = 34\n | isbn = 9780851158709\n | access-date = 21 August 2019\n | quote = The warriors are farmers and the farmers are warriors, so you have to time your war in relation to the harvest and to other agricultural events.
