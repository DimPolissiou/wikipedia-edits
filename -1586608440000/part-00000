This can be related to either one's push for survival on the brink of death, or someone who is just trying to find a meaning to continuing their life. Some researchers say that people who have a reason or purpose in life during such dreadful and horrific experiences will often appear to fare better than those that may find such experiences overwhelming.<ref>Frankl, V. E. (1963). In Man's search for meaning. Boston: Beacon Press.</ref> Everyday, people undergo countless types of negative experiences, some of which may be demoralizing, hurtful, or tragic. An ongoing question continues to be what keeps the will to live in these situations. Some people that claim to have experienced instances of the will to live, have many different explanations behind it.<ref>Grohol, J. (2009). The Power of the Will to Live. Psych Central.

In [[psychotherapy]], [[Sigmund Freud]] termed the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], which is the seeking of [[pleasure]] and avoiding of [[suffering|pain]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Snyder\n  | first = C.

[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live.\nPsychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree{{weasel inline|date=August 2019}} that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges.\n\n== Similarity to self-preservation ==\n\nSelf-preservation is a behavior that ensures the survival of an organism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/self-preservation|title=Self-preservation - definition of self-preservation by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref> [[Pain]] and [[fear]] are integral parts of this mechanism.

Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see: [[defence mechanism]].)\n\nEven the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} An example is the [[dodo]], which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them.\n\n==Correlations==\n\u201cExistential, psychiatric, social, and, to a lesser degree, physical variables are highly correlated with the will to live\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

Psychiatric issues found to be strongly associated are such as depression, anxiety, and  lack of concentration. Physical issues that showed the strongest associations were appetite and appearance which did not show the same consistent degree of correlation. The four main predictor variables of the will to live changing over time are anxiety, shortness of breath, depression, and sense of well-being<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one\u2019s will to live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger will to live and strengthened or stable will to live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak will to live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained will to live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the will to live, lived the longest while high will to live could affect individuals in any direction.

The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. 28 Nov. 2017 https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/will+to+live</ref> The will to live is an important concept when attempting to understand and comprehend why we do what we do in order to stay alive, and for as long as we can. This can be related to either one's push for survival on the brink of death, or someone who is just trying to find a meaning to continuing their life. Some researchers say that people who have a reason or purpose in life during such dreadful and horrific experiences will often appear to fare better than those that may find such experiences overwhelming.<ref>Frankl, V. E. (1963). In Man's search for meaning. Boston: Beacon Press.</ref> Everyday, people undergo countless types of negative experiences, some of which may be demoralizing, hurtful, or tragic. An ongoing question continues to be what keeps the will to live in these situations. Some people that claim to have experienced instances of the will to live, have many different explanations behind it.<ref>Grohol, J. (2009). The Power of the Will to Live. Psych Central.

In [[psychotherapy]], [[Sigmund Freud]] termed the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], which is the seeking of [[pleasure]] and avoiding of [[suffering|pain]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Snyder\n  | first = C.

[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live.\nPsychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree{{weasel inline|date=August 2019}} that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges.\n\n== Similarity to self-preservation ==\n\nSelf-preservation is a behavior that ensures the survival of an organism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/self-preservation|title=Self-preservation - definition of self-preservation by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref> [[Pain]] and [[fear]] are integral parts of this mechanism.

Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see: [[defence mechanism]].)\n\nEven the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} An example is the [[dodo]], which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them.\n\n==Correlations==\n\u201cExistential, psychiatric, social, and, to a lesser degree, physical variables are highly correlated with the will to live\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

Psychiatric issues found to be strongly associated are such as depression, anxiety, and  lack of concentration. Physical issues that showed the strongest associations were appetite and appearance which did not show the same consistent degree of correlation. The four main predictor variables of the will to live changing over time are anxiety, shortness of breath, depression, and sense of well-being<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

Social variables and quality of life measures are shown to correlate significantly with the will to live such as support and satisfaction with support from family, friends, and health care providers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one\u2019s will to live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger will to live and strengthened or stable will to live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak will to live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H.

In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained will to live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the will to live, lived the longest while high will to live could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of will to live in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tataryn | first1 = D. | last2 = Chochoniv | first2 = H.

The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and is a good example of this as well.<ref>Goldenberg, J. Retrieved from http://www.councilforrelationships.org/resources/goldenberg-survival.pdf</ref> A proposed mechanism for the will to live is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one\u2019s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.<ref>Goode, E.

From 1991 it was known as '''Tilbury Douglas''' following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 rebranded as '''Interserve plc'''. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] and [[facilities management]] services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\n\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's [[energy-from-waste]] business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. Its financial situation worsened in late 2018, and debt holders started discussing a further financial restructuring of the business. The debt-for-equity plan was rejected at an [[annual general meeting]] on 15 March 2019, and the parent company went into [[administration (law)|administration]] owing creditors over \u00a3100m.

There was a further synergy between lightering and dredging; lightering was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into [[port]], whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] into port. The company's move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to lightering. This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry [[bulk cargo]] after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of [[road haulage]] as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as [[London Docklands|Docklands]]) and [[shipping]] adopted [[containerisation]] methods.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/dec/18/thames-lighterage-industry UK Parliamentary Debate 18 December 1967] Hansard 18 December 1967 Retrieved 18 March 2013</ref> However, for the time being lightering still thrived and the [[New Zealand]]-based ''[[Ashburton Guardian]]'' reported in 1890 that the company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat.

From 1991 it was known as '''Tilbury Douglas''' following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 rebranded as '''Interserve plc'''. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] and [[facilities management]] services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\n\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's [[energy-from-waste]] business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. Its financial situation worsened in late 2018, and debt holders started discussing a further financial restructuring of the business. The debt-for-equity plan was rejected at an [[annual general meeting]] on 15 March 2019, and the parent company went into [[administration (law)|administration]] owing creditors over \u00a3100m.

There was a further synergy between lightering and dredging; lightering was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into [[port]], whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] into port. The company's move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to lightering. This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry [[bulk cargo]] after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of [[road haulage]] as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as [[London Docklands|Docklands]]) and [[shipping]] adopted [[containerisation]] methods.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/dec/18/thames-lighterage-industry UK Parliamentary Debate 18 December 1967] Hansard 18 December 1967 Retrieved 18 March 2013</ref> However, for the time being lightering still thrived and the [[New Zealand]]-based ''[[Ashburton Guardian]]'' reported in 1890 that the company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat.

To fight their mutual enemies, Cobra of [[High&Low#Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)|Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)]] suggests the five SWORD gangs should ally. However, as their leader Smoky's illness takes a turn for the worse, [[High&Low#Rude Boys|Rude Boys]] members who attend the summit of SWORD leaders in place of Smoky refuse the plan, saying that it's more important for them to survive. [[High&Low#White Rascals|White Rascals]]' leader Rocky refuses to ally too, maintaining that they only want to protect women.

The vicious man he has a feud with, [[High&Low#DOUBT|Doubt]]'s leader Ranmaru Hayashi has got out of prison, Rocky does not want the other SWORD gangs to get involved in the feud between them. Ranmaru Hayashi came prepared, with his money and the fierce Prison Gang he calls from the prison, he almost destroys White Rascals and injures Rocky. Cobra offers Rocky his help, but Rocky insists that one should rely on his own when he can.\n\nMeanwhile, another fight against the casino plan has begun. After the death of their older brother Takeru, [[High&Low#The Amamiya Brothers|Masaki and Hiroto Amamiya]] gives the [[USB flash drive|USB]] with proof of politicians taking bribes from the Kuryu Group to Kohaku, who deeply regrets the mistakes he has made and wants to expose the evil of the Kuryu Group. Kuryu Group becomes aware of their plans of publicising information in the USB, and they send Genji Kuki, vice leader of Kurosakikai, to kill the Kohaku and his right arm man Tsukumo. \n\nTo end the feud between themselves and the alliance of Doubt and the Prison Gang, the White Rascals head to the fatal battle. When they are almost killed by their powerful enemy, Cobra, and other SWORD members, come to their rescue with the determination to protect the SWORD area as a whole from their enemies. At the same time, Kohaku,&nbsp; Tsukumo and the Amamiya brothers have to fight the formidable killer Genji Kuki.\n\nThe biggest fight that will determine the future of the SWORD area begins.

When they are almost killed by their powerful enemy, Cobra, and other SWORD members, come to their rescue with the determination to protect the SWORD area as a whole from their enemies.

In fact, the film would give you a feeling of \"I don't know the plot, but the action is great.\"\n\nUtamaru himself praised the film, stating that \"The action, its creativity and the quality of the film are outstanding among Japanese films, and the car chases scenes and parkour battles scenes of the Rude Boys are worth watching\". He also pointed out that \"the relationship between the characters is also one of the film's best attractions, which adds to the charisma of its characters. He enjoyed it when the theme song of each organization is played during each battle, which reminded him of the heroes of [[Tokusatsu]].\n\nHe also stated that the production of the whole film is quite something in Japanese film history, writing \" Not only the action scenes, but the level of luxury in the subtleties of the art, sets, costumes, and novel techniques of photography is really something that can be said to be a rare quality in the history of Japanese cinema, something that can truly show the level of Japanese cinema. It is those very physically fit actors, together with perfect camera work, perfect art, and fine costumes that enable the film to achieve this kind of perfection. \" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbsradio.jp/178021|title=\u3010\u6620\u753b\u8a55\u66f8\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u3011\u5b87\u591a\u4e38\u3001\u300eHiGH\uff06LOWTHEMOVIE2/ENDOFSKY\u300f\u3092\u8a9e\u308b\uff01\uff082017.8.26\u653e\u9001\uff09|website=TBS\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa FM90.5 + AM954\uff5e\u4f55\u304b\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u308b\u97f3\u304c\u3059\u308b\uff5e|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* JAPAN ACTION AWARDS 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/eiga/news/273997|title=\u7b2c6\u56de\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u300cHiGH&LOW\u300d\u304c2\u51a0\u3001\u6700\u512a\u79c0\u7537\u512a\u8cde\u306f\u4f50\u85e4\u5065|last=Inc|first=Natasha|website=\u6620\u753b\u30ca\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc|language=ja|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref>\n** Best Action Scene\n** Best Action Director: Takahito Ouchi\n\n== Sequels & Spin-offs ==\n\n=== ''[[High&Low The Movie 3 / Final Mission]]'' ===\n''High&Low The Movie 3 / Final Mission'' was released on November 11, 2017.

His mother died when Romulus was an infant, and his father subsequently moved him to [[Sumner County, Tennessee]]. Following his father's death in 1803, uncle James Saunders became legal guardian and brought Romulus back to Caswell County to attend Hyco and Caswell Academies.\nIn 1809, Saunders enrolled at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. He was expelled in March 1810 for firing a pistol on campus and throwing \"a stone at the Faculty\". Nine years later, Saunders would be elected to the university's board of trustees, where he served for forty-five years.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nAfter his expulsion, Saunders moved to [[Tennessee]] and read law under future Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]]. He was admitted to the bar in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1812, and returned to Caswell County the same year. In 1815, he was elected to the [[North Carolina House of Commons]] and soon after the [[North Carolina Senate]]. In 1818 he returned to the House, and served as [[Speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons|Speaker of the House]] from 1819 to 1820.\n\n===U.S. House of Representatives===\nSaunders was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[1820 United States House of Representatives elections|1820]]. As congressman, Saunders was known for his unabashed pro-[[states' rights]] opinions. Saunders was such a staunch support of [[William H. Crawford]]'s presidential campaign in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 election]] that the eventual winner [[John Quincy Adams]] referred to the congressman as the most \"cankered or venomous reptile in the country\".<ref>[[William J. Cooper, Jr.|Cooper, William J.]] ''The Lost Founding Father: John Quincy Adams and the Transformation of American Politics'' (Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2017).</ref>\nAs an admirer of [[Nathaniel Macon]], Saunders was a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]], believing that \"men in power are apt to think the peoples' money is intended to be expended in such way as their distempered fancy may support\".<ref>''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography: Vol. 5, P-S'' (The University of North Carolina Press, 1994).</ref> Despite this, Saunders supported internal improvements such as roads and railroads projects.\n\n===State government===\nIn 1828, Saunders left Congress to become [[North Carolina Attorney General]]. He left the post in 1834 after receiving a presidential appointment on the French spoliations claims commission.\nThe [[North Carolina state legislature|state legislature]] appointed Saunders to the [[North Carolina Superior Court]] in 1835 - an office he held until 1840 when he became the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for [[Governor of North Carolina]]. After a contentious campaign, Saunders was defeated by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] nominee [[John Motley Morehead]].\nDuring his time in state government, the [[North Carolina Democratic Party]] split into two factions. Saunders led the states' rights faction, which believed in the ideas of [[John C. Calhoun]]. The more moderate wing was led by [[Bedford Brown]], a fellow Caswell native and political enemy to Saunders. When Democrats gained control of the state legislature in 1842, both Brown and Saunders ran for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat. Neither man received a majority of votes, and the seat went to [[William Henry Haywood Jr.]].\n\n===Return to Congress===\nSaunders returned to Congress following his election in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1840|1840]], where he became an outspoken opponent of [[Martin Van Buren]] and his allies who opposed the annexation of Texas. At the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], Saunders sponsored a resolution requiring a two-thirds vote for the selection of a presidential candidate. This paved the way for the nomination of [[James K. Polk]].\n\n===Minister to Spain===\nPerhaps as an act of appreciation for helping him win the Democratic presidential nomination, President Polk appointed Saunders as minister plenipotentiary to [[Spain]] in 1846. As minister, Saunders negotiated a secret agreement in which Spain offered to sell [[Cuba]] to the United States. The media leaked this agreement, causing negotiations to falter. Saunders resigned from his post in 1849.\n\n===Return to state government===\nSaunders moved to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and in 1850 was elected to represent [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] in the House of Commons. As representative, Saunders became a supporter of constructing the [[North Carolina Railroad]].\nSaunders again attempted to be appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1852. The legislature could not agree on whom to appoint, and the seat remained open until the appointment of [[David Settle Reid]] in 1854. The legislature did, however, reappoint Saunders to the Superior Court.\n\n==Personal life==\nSaunders married Rebecca Peine Carter on December 27, 1812. The marriage produced five children: James, Franklin, Camillus, Anne Peine, and Rebecca. Rebecca later died, and Saunders married Anne Heyes Johnson (the daughter of [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]]) on May 26, 1823. The couple had at least four children: William Johnson, Margaret Madeline, Jane Claudia, and Julia A.\nAround 1831, the Saunders family purchased the [[Elmwood (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Elmwood]] estate in Raleigh \u2013 the former home of [[John Louis Taylor]]. Saunders died there on April 21, 1867, and was buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nSamuel A.

His mother died when Romulus was an infant, and his father subsequently moved him to [[Sumner County, Tennessee]]. Following his father's death in 1803, uncle James Saunders became legal guardian and brought Romulus back to Caswell County to attend Hyco and Caswell Academies.\nIn 1809, Saunders enrolled at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. He was expelled in March 1810 for firing a pistol on campus and throwing \"a stone at the Faculty\". Nine years later, Saunders would be elected to the university's board of trustees, where he served for forty-five years.\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nAfter his expulsion, Saunders moved to [[Tennessee]] and read law under future Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]]. He was admitted to the bar in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1812, and returned to Caswell County the same year. In 1815, he was elected to the [[North Carolina House of Commons]] and soon after the [[North Carolina Senate]]. In 1818 he returned to the House, and served as [[Speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons|Speaker of the House]] from 1819 to 1820.\n===U.S. House of Representatives===\nSaunders was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[1820 United States House of Representatives elections|1820]]. As congressman, Saunders was known for his unabashed pro-[[states' rights]] opinions. Saunders was such a staunch support of [[William H. Crawford]]'s presidential campaign in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 election]] that the eventual winner [[John Quincy Adams]] referred to the congressman as the most \"cankered or venomous reptile in the country\".<ref>[[William J. Cooper, Jr.|Cooper, William J.]] ''The Lost Founding Father: John Quincy Adams and the Transformation of American Politics'' (Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2017).</ref>\nAs an admirer of [[Nathaniel Macon]], Saunders was a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]], believing that \"men in power are apt to think the peoples' money is intended to be expended in such way as their distempered fancy may support\".<ref>''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography: Vol. 5, P-S'' (The University of North Carolina Press, 1994).</ref> Despite this, Saunders supported internal improvements such as roads and railroads projects.\n===State government===\nIn 1828, Saunders left Congress to become [[North Carolina Attorney General]]. He left the post in 1834 after receiving a presidential appointment on the French spoilations claims commission.\nThe [[North Carolina state legislature|state legislature]] appointed Saunders to the [[North Carolina Superior Court]] in 1835 - an office he held until 1840 when he became the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for [[Governor of North Carolina]]. After a contentious campaign, Saunders was defeated by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] nominee [[John Motley Morehead]].\nDuring his time in state government, the [[North Carolina Democratic Party]] split into two factions. Saunders led the states' rights faction, which believed in the ideas of [[John C. Calhoun]]. The more moderate wing was led by [[Bedford Brown]], a fellow Caswell native and political enemy to Saunders. When Democrats gained control of the state legislature in 1842, both Brown and Saunders ran for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat. Neither man received a majority of votes, and the seat went to [[William Henry Haywood Jr.]].\n===Return to Congress===\nSaunders returned to Congress following his election in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1840|1840]], where he became an outspoken opponent of [[Martin Van Buren]] and his allies who opposed the annexation of Texas. At the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], Saunders sponsored a resolution requiring a two-thirds vote for the selection of a presidential candidate. This paved the way for the nomination of [[James K. Polk]].\n===Minister to Spain===\nPerhaps as an act of appreciation for helping him win the Democratic presidential nomination, President Polk appointed Saunders as minister plenipotentiary to [[Spain]] in 1846. As minister, Saunders negotiated a secret agreement in which Spain offered to sell [[Cuba]] to the United States. The media leaked this agreement, causing negotiations to falter. Saunders resigned from his post in 1849.\n===Return to state government===\nSaunders moved to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and in 1850 was elected to represent [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] in the House of Commons. As representative, Saunders became a supporter of constructing the [[North Carolina Railroad]].\nSaunders again attempted to be appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1852. The legislature could not agree on whom to appoint, and the seat remained open until the appointment of [[David Settle Reid]] in 1854. The legislature did, however, reappoint Saunders to the Superior Court.\n==Personal life==\nSaunders married Rebecca Peine Carter on December 27, 1812. The marriage produced five children: James, Franklin, Camillus, Anne Peine, and Rebecca. Rebecca later died, and Saunders married Anne Heyes Johnson (the daughter of [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]]) on May 26, 1823. The couple had at least four children: William Johnson, Margaret Madeline, Jane Claudia, and Julia A.\nAround 1831, the Saunders family purchased the [[Elmwood (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Elmwood]] estate in Raleigh \u2013 the former home of [[John Louis Taylor]]. Saunders died there on April 21, 1867, and was buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nSamuel A.

In her study of food sciences, she was introduced to biochemistry and microbiology, which led her to study DNA manipulation. She then received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from [[Ohio State University]] in 1986. She continued to work at OSU for three more years in a post-doctoral position studying gene regulation in fungi. During her time at OSU, she cloned numerous genes important for nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in ''Neurospora''. One of these genes, cys-3, encodes a leucine zipper protein. It was hypothesized that leucine zippers were DNA-binding elements. The first proof of this in living organisms was a mutation in the cys-3 leucine zipper, which caused a sulfur metabolism defect. After studying the mutation, Fu demonstrated that the mutated cys-3 was unable to bind DNA.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://scienceofsleep.org/bio-eng/|title = Science of Sleep - Biography|date = |accessdate = |website = Science of Sleep|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Fu transferred to the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a post-doctoral fellow to study human genetics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Neurogenetics: Ying-Hui Fu|url = http://www.neugenes.org/yinghuifu.htm|website = www.neugenes.org|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}</ref> While there, she was part of the team that identified the [[Fragile X syndrome|fragile-X]] syndrome gene.

After leaving Millennium Pharmaceutical, from 1995- August 1997 Fu worked for Darwin Molecular Corporation for two years and took part in the search for the mutations responsible for premature aging (Werner Syndrome) and early onset Alzheimer's Disease (Presinilin 2).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Recent career ===\nIn 1997, Fu returned to academia, taking the position of associate professor of research at the [[University of Utah]].

This woman and her family would become the subject of study for Fu and her collaborator Louis Ptacek for [[Advanced sleep phase disorder#Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome|familial advanced sleep phase]] syndrome (FASPS). They cloned the causative gene/mutation and studied the ''in vitro'' biochemical consequences of the mutation, culminating in a 2001 paper<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11232563 | doi=10.1126/science.1057499 | volume=291 | title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome | date=February 2001 | journal=Science | pages=1040\u20133  | last1 = Toh | first1 = KL | last2 = Jones | first2 = CR | last3 = He | first3 = Y | display-authors = etal}}</ref> An h''Per2'' phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome, reporting the first circadian gene mutation in humans.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Scientists Search for the Best Sleepers|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-search-for-the-best-sleepers-1402354792|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = June 9, 2014|access-date = April 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Sumathi|last = Reddy}}</ref>\n\n====Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome====\nIn 2001, Fu and her collaborator's labs published a paper that explained a phenotype of extremely early risers in humans called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=KL|date=2001|title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5506|pages=1040\u20133|doi=10.1126/science.1057499|pmid=11232563|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1040T|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.460}}</ref> Humans with this [[autosomal dominant]] disease typically go to bed around 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and wake up at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. The lab studied the genomes of people with this trait and found a point mutation in the [[PER2]] gene that likely causes the behavioral phenotype.\n\n====Short sleep phenotype====\nIn 2009, Fu's group published a paper that explained the mechanisms of a short sleep phenotype in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Y|date=2009|title=Transcriptional suppressor DEC2 is a Regulator for Human Sleep Homeostasis|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5942|pages=866\u2013870|doi=10.1126/science.1174443|pmc=2884988|pmid=19679812}}</ref> In one family, carriers of the  [[autosomal dominant]] phenotype sleep 6.25 hours compared to non-carrying family members, who sleep more than 8 hours per night. Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called [[DEC2]] that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a [[proline]]-to-[[arginine]] switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. [[Transgenic]] mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes. It is not currently known what other molecules DEC2 interacts with to produce the short sleep phenotype.\n\n===Neurodegeneration===\n\n==== Trinucleotide repeat expansions and neurological diseases ====\nWhen Fu did her post-doctoral work in Baylor College, she was part of the team that was positional cloning the Fragile-X syndrome gene. There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA.

Her chief discoveries include describing Mendelian sleep phenotypes, identifying causative genes and mutations for [[circadian rhythm]] disorders, and characterizing genetic forms of [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating degenerative disorders]]. Fu is currently a professor of neurology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. She was elected to the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/05/410331/2-ucsf-faculty-elected-national-academy-sciences-2018|title=2 UCSF Faculty Elected to the National Academy of Sciences for 2018|last=Bai|first=Nina|date=2018-05-02|website=UC San Francisco|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Background and education==\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn 1980, Fu received a degree in food science from [[National Chung-Hsing University]] in Taiwan. In her study of food sciences, she was introduced to biochemistry and microbiology, which led her to study DNA manipulation. She then received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from [[Ohio State University]] in 1986. She continued to work at OSU for three more years in a post-doctoral position studying gene regulation in fungi. During her time at OSU, she cloned numerous genes important for nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in ''Neurospora''. One of these genes, cys-3, encodes a leucine zipper protein. It was hypothesized that leucine zippers were DNA-binding elements. The first proof of this in living organisms was a mutation in the cys-3 leucine zipper, which caused a sulfur metabolism defect. After studying the mutation, Fu demonstrated that the mutated cys-3 was unable to bind DNA.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://scienceofsleep.org/bio-eng/|title = Science of Sleep - Biography|date = |accessdate = |website = Science of Sleep|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Fu transferred to the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a post-doctoral fellow to study human genetics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Neurogenetics: Ying-Hui Fu|url = http://www.neugenes.org/yinghuifu.htm|website = www.neugenes.org|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}</ref> While there, she was part of the team that identified the [[Fragile X syndrome|fragile-X]] syndrome gene. The gene contains a polymorphic CGG trinucleotide repeat in their DNA sequence; the repeat ranged from 6 to 54 in individuals with normal X chromosomes. The transition from stable to unstable occurred between 46 and 52 repeats. The instability increases the likelihood of fragile-X mental retardation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schepens|first=Bert|last2=Tinton|first2=Sandrine A.|last3=Bruynooghe|first3=Yanik|last4=Beyaert|first4=Rudi|last5=Cornelis|first5=Sigrid|date=2005-01-01|title=The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein stimulates HIF-1\u03b1 IRES-mediated translation during hypoxia|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=33|issue=21|pages=6884\u20136894|doi=10.1093/nar/gki1000|issn=0305-1048|pmc=1310900|pmid=16396835}}</ref> The repeats have a tendency to expand in transmission through meiosis.

Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called [[DEC2]] that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a [[proline]]-to-[[arginine]] switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. [[Transgenic]] mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes.

There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA. This mutational mechanism is now known to cause not only Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy, but also Huntington's disease and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias.

However, the team had a losing record under the new coach and he was fired in February, replaced by [[Binghamton Senators]]' head coach [[Cory Clouston]].

The Senators re-signed forwards [[Shean Donovan]], [[Chris Kelly (ice hockey)|Chris Kelly]] and [[Antoine Vermette]] and made several free agent signings, including [[Alex Auld]], [[Jarkko Ruutu]] and [[Jason Smith (ice hockey)|Jason Smith]]. After an extended period of negotiations with [[Andrej Mesz\u00e1ro\u0161|Andrej Meszaros]] failed to produce a contract, the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] showed interest in the defenceman, who was a restricted free agent.

We were 14 games over .500 when I was fired. They're seven under now. Somebody needs to take responsibility for that.

Murray commented, \"I'm disappointed and a little bit surprised by it. I'm not sure what purpose he was trying to achieve doing that. He sent me an apology. The only complaint I ever had with John was that I didn't think he worked hard enough at getting himself ready and getting the team ready to play games.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Flyers suffer ugly defeat |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=2009-02-13 |work=Camden Courier-Post |last=Gormley |first=Chuck |url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20090213/SPORTS04/902130354/1006/NEWS01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nLate in February and early in March, as the season neared the trade deadline, the team still held out hold of making the playoffs although the team remained over ten points out of a playoff spot, as the team was winning more often with Clouston. The Senators began making roster deals, sending [[Dean McAmmond]] and a 2009 first-round pick for [[Chris Campoli]] and [[Mike Comrie]]. By the [[NHL trade deadline]] day of March 4, Murray admitted to the media that the club would be \"sellers\" and had given up hope of making the playoffs. On March 4, [[Antoine Vermette]] was traded to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for goaltender [[Pascal Leclaire]] and a draft pick. Martin Gerber was put on waivers three times and was finally picked up by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].\n\nAlthough the club improved its record under new coach Clouston, including a 10\u20135\u20130 record in March, it was not enough to salvage the season. On March 31, following a loss to the [[Florida Panthers]] and a win by the Montreal Canadiens, the club was officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 1996.\n\nAlthough eliminated, the team continued to play well, including a nine-game win streak on home ice. By April 8, the team's record under Clouston was 19\u201310\u20133 and he was rewarded with a two-year deal to continue coaching the Senators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://senators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=417229 |title=Sens keeping Clouston behind bench |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-08 |publisher=Ottawa Senators. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109235045/http://senators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page |archive-date=2010-01-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Divisional standings===\n{{2008\u201309 NHL Northeast Division standings|team=OTT}}\n\n===Conference standings===\n{{2008\u201309 NHL Eastern Conference standings|team=OTT}}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

However, the team had a losing record under the new coach and he was fired in February, replaced by [[Binghamton Senators]]' head coach [[Cory Clouston]]. The team improved its record under Clouston, but not enough to qualify for the [[2009 Stanley Cup playoffs|2009 playoffs]], ending an 11-year string of qualifying for the playoffs.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Off-season==\nIt was an off-season of numerous personnel changes. [[Wade Redden]], a long-time Senator, signed a contract as a free agent with the [[New York Rangers]]. [[Ray Emery]] and [[Brian McGrattan]], considered poor influences in the dressing room, were discarded. The Senators re-signed forwards [[Shean Donovan]], [[Chris Kelly (ice hockey)|Chris Kelly]] and [[Antoine Vermette]] and made several free agent signings, including [[Alex Auld]], [[Jarkko Ruutu]] and [[Jason Smith (ice hockey)|Jason Smith]]. After an extended period of negotiations with [[Andrej Mesz\u00e1ro\u0161|Andrej Meszaros]] failed to produce a contract, the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] showed interest in the defenceman, who was a restricted free agent. Unable to provide the draft picks needed to compensate the Senators, a trade was made and the Senators received [[Filip Kuba]], [[Alexandre R.

We were 14 games over .500 when I was fired. They're seven under now. Somebody needs to take responsibility for that.

Murray commented, \"I'm disappointed and a little bit surprised by it. I'm not sure what purpose he was trying to achieve doing that. He sent me an apology.

The Senators began making roster deals, sending [[Dean McAmmond]] and a 2009 first-round pick for [[Chris Campoli]] and [[Mike Comrie]]. By the [[NHL trade deadline]] day of March 4, Murray admitted to the media that the club would be \"sellers\" and had given up hope of making the playoffs. On March 4, [[Antoine Vermette]] was traded to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for goaltender [[Pascal Leclaire]] and a draft pick. Martin Gerber was put on waivers three times and was finally picked up by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].\n\nAlthough the club improved its record under new coach Clouston, including a 10\u20135\u20130 record in March, it was not enough to salvage the season. On March 31, following a loss to the [[Florida Panthers]] and a win by the Montreal Canadiens, the club was officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 1996.\n\nAlthough eliminated, the team continued to play well, including a nine-game win streak on home ice. By April 8, the team's record under Clouston was 19\u201310\u20133 and he was rewarded with a two-year deal to continue coaching the Senators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://senators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=417229 |title=Sens keeping Clouston behind bench |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-08 |publisher=Ottawa Senators. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109235045/http://senators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page |archive-date=2010-01-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Divisional standings===\n{{2008\u201309 NHL Northeast Division standings|team=OTT}}\n\n===Conference standings===\n{{2008\u201309 NHL Eastern Conference standings|team=OTT}}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
