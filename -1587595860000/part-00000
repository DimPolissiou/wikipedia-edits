Artists who were featured on the album include Sabath, [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Lennon Stella]], [[Sasha Sloan]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]] and [[AJ Mitchell]].

Trainor worked with producers including Mike Sabath, [[Tyler Johnson (musician)|Tyler Johnson]] and Ojivolta, and co-wrote songs with her brothers Ryan and Justin Trainor and British singer [[Frances (musician)|Frances]] among others, to create the album. Artists who were featured on the album include Sabath, [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Lennon Stella]], [[Sasha Sloan]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]] and [[AJ Mitchell]]. Musically, ''Treat Myself'' was Trainor's attempt to create a [[Pop music|pop]] record that feels relevant in an era when [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] reigns.\n\nInitially slated for release in August 2018, preceded by the singles \"[[No Excuses (Meghan Trainor song)|No Excuses]]\", \"[[Let You Be Right]]\" and \"[[Can't Dance (Meghan Trainor song)|Can't Dance]]\", the singer delayed the album as she wanted to add more songs to it. The final version of it only includes the singles \"No Excuses\", \"[[Wave (Meghan Trainor song)|Wave]]\" and \"[[Nice to Meet Ya (Meghan Trainor song)|Nice to Meet Ya]]\". ''Treat Myself'' was released to mixed reviews from critics, with some of them thinking that it was worth the wait and others criticizing the lyrical content. It debuted at number 25 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and also reached the top 30 in Australia, Canada, Spain and Switzerland. Trainor promoted ''Treat Myself'' through a series of public appearances and televised live performances.\n\n==Background and release==\nIn a March 2018 interview, [[Meghan Trainor]] described her forthcoming third major-label studio album as her \"best work yet\", revealing that her family members would provide background vocals on every track and teasing \"Treat Myself\" as a potential song title.<ref name=\"BBMarch\">{{cite web|last1=Weatherby|first1=Taylor|title=Meghan Trainor Details How Her Family & Fiance Reassured She's 'Built to Be a Pop Star' After Vocal Surgery|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8221791/meghan-trainor-interview-new-single-no-excuses-vocal-surgery|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=March 1, 2018|date=March 1, 2018}}</ref> Following the release of several singles, Trainor confirmed it as the album title on June 19, 2018, with its pre-order going up the following day.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tornow |first=Sam |title=Meghan Trainor Announces New Album 'Treat Myself' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8461763/meghan-trainor-announces-new-album-treat-myself |website=Billboard |accessdate=April 19, 2020 |date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> She delayed ''Treat Myself'' for an undefined period of time in August 2018, stating that she was in \"such an amazing place and can't stop writing songs\".<ref name=\"Mix929\">{{cite web|url=https://mix929.com/news/articles/2018/aug/06/meghan-trainor-pushes-back-treat-myself-release-in-order-to-add-new-songs/|title=Meghan Trainor pushes back 'Treat Myself' release in order to add new songs|publisher=[[WJXA]]|date=August 6, 2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref> In November 2018, Trainor stated that she had worked with [[Sasha Sloan]] and [[Lennon Stella]] on a track for the album titled \"Working On It\", which she called \"about loving yourself and just trying\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mix947.radio.com/blogs/michael-cerio/exclusive-meghan-trainor-teases-possible-collaborations-her-new-album|title=EXCLUSIVE: Meghan Trainor Teases Possible Collaborations For Her New Album|publisher=[[KAMX|Mix 94.7]]|last=Cerio|first=Michael|date=November 6, 2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, Trainor announced the release of an EP called ''[[The Love Train]]'', describing it as \"something of an appetizer\" to ''Treat Myself''.

Produced by Collins along with [[Hugh Padgham]], it was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from his number-one album ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989). As with his song for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], \"[[Man on the Corner]]\", the track has as its subject the problem of [[homelessness]];<ref name=Dean>{{cite book |title= Rock N' Roll Gold Rush |url= https://archive.org/details/rocknrollgoldrus00dean |url-access= registration |author=Maury Dean |year=2003 |publisher=Algora |isbn=0-87586-207-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/rocknrollgoldrus00dean/page/n75 60]}}</ref> as such, the song was a substantial departure from the [[Dance music|dance]]-[[pop music]] of his previous album, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985).\n\nCollins sings the song from a third-person perspective, as he observes a man crossing the street to ignore a homeless woman, and he implores listeners not to turn a blind eye to homelessness because, by drawing a religious allusion, \"it's just another day for you and me in [[paradise]]\". Collins also appeals directly to [[God]] by singing: \"Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do? Oh Lord, there must be something you can say.\"\n\nThe song was Collins' seventh and final [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No. 1 single, the last No. 1 single of the 1980s and the first No. 1 single of the 1990s. It was also a worldwide success, eventually becoming one of the most successful songs of his solo career. It won Collins and Padgham the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year#Recipients|Record of the Year]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1991 awards ceremony]], while it was also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year#Recipients|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance#Recipients|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video#Recipients|Best Music Video, Short Form]]. \"Another Day in Paradise\" also won an award for [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year#Winners and nominees|British Single]] at the [[1990 Brit Awards#Winners and nominees|1990 Brit Awards]]. Despite the awards gained following its release, the song also generated some controversy over its subject matter and has received a largely negative reaction from music critics.\n\nThe live performance of the song at the [[33rd Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]] by Collins and [[David Crosby]], who provided backing vocals on the track, was released on the 1994 album ''Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002IXZ/ |title=Grammy's Greatest Moments, Volume 1: Various Artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> In 2009, Collins's version was listed at 86th on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Greatest Songs of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-90.shtml |title=Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=1 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090425025152/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-90.shtml| archivedate= 25 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> \"Another Day in Paradise\" has since been covered by several artists, including [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], her brother [[Ray J]], Jam Tronik, [[Axxis]], [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]], and [[Hank Marvin]].\n\n==Chart performance==\nThe song was another massive hit for Collins. On 23 December 1989, it became his seventh ({{As of|2018|April|alt=and, to date, final}}) No. 1 single in the U.S.<ref name=Dean/> The song was also the final No. 1 song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at No. 1 for four weeks, which classifies the song as a hit from the 1990s as well. This song is notable for keeping [[Janet Jackson|Janet Jackson's]] \"[[Rhythm Nation]]\" from reaching No. 1. It also saw out the 1980s and saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The song had already reached No. 2 in the UK in November of that year. The single version is slightly different from the album version in that it uses a shorter intro.\n\n==Music video==\nThe song's music video was directed by Jim Yukich.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6668700/</ref> The video, shot entirely in black and white, features Collins singing in a dark background, interspersed with images of the homeless, the immigrants and the poverty of the chidrens in the streets. The music video also features many messages about the homeless, to convey the full message of the song.\n\n==Reception==\nMusic historian [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] wrote that \"Another Day in Paradise\" had been widely criticised.<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|date=14 Sep 2007|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music: Concise (5th Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=PA2006-IA1345&lpg=PA2006-IA1345&dq=%22the+widely+criticised+another+day+in+paradise%22&source=bl&ots=JbkVzlVh0q&sig=RQ-2rIR4x34EBnSdP0QgVlMVLmc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2Nz1U-fnOvLb7Abf0IFA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20widely%20criticised%20another%20day%20in%20paradise%22&f=false|publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]]|isbn=1846098564|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref> Collins addressed the criticism from the English rock press at the time of its release, who found him unqualified to sing about the poor due to his wealth, by saying: \"When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It's a misconception that if you have a lot of money you're somehow out of touch with reality.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/arts/the-pop-life-365789.html|title=The Pop Life|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=6 December 1989|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSinger-songwriter and political activist [[Billy Bragg]] was scathing of the song in an interview in 2000, drawing a contrast between Collins and a band he admired, [[the Clash]], stating: \"Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn't have the action to go with it he's just exploiting that for a subject.\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20260660,00.html | title= Bragg-ing Rites | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Rob | last=Brunner | date=30 June 2000 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> In 2003, [[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Andrew Collins]] described the song as a \"bland redress\" for the subject of homelessness in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194648 | title= Give music a chance | work=New Statesman | first=Andrew | last=Collins | date=24 February 2003 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' dismissed the track in 2007 as \"a song that addressed the issue of homelessness with the same insight as [[Melanie C|Sporty Spice]]'s '[[If That Were Me]]'\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/19/iwishidneverheardofphil | title= I wish I'd never heard of Phil Collins ... | work=The Guardian | first=Caroline | last=Sullivan | date=19 September 2007 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2010, David Sheppard described the song's lyrics as \"cringe-worthy\" and gave it as an example of Collins \"painting the bull's-eye on his own forehead\" when it came to his negative status with music critics.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/m9nv | title= Phil Collins Going Back Review | publisher=BBC | first=David | last=Sheppard | accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[MSN]] in 2013, Hugh Wilson contrasted Collins's concern for the homeless in the song with his concern as a multimillionaire at the prospect of the UK's election of a tax-raising [[socialism|socialist]] government. Referring to Collins's statement that he would consider leaving the UK with the election of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, Wilson noted that the song led to \"accusations of hypocrisy\" because Collins had \"bemoaned the plight of the homeless\" in it. Wilson also said Collins became \"an easy target when future elections came round\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/famous-men-and-their-misunderstood-politics-di-canio-fascist-row?page=7 |title=Famous men and their misunderstood politics |work=MSN |first=Hugh |last=Wilson |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222225551/http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/famous-men-and-their-misunderstood-politics-di-canio-fascist-row?page=7 |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n'''12\" single'''\n#\"Another Day in Paradise\" (album version) \u2013 5:22\n#\"Another Day in Paradise\" (radio edit) \u2013 4:04\n\n'''CD maxi single'''\n#\"Another Day in Paradise\" \u2013 5:15\n#\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" \u2013 1:25\n#\"Heat on the Street\" \u2013 3:59\n\n'''7\" single'''\n#\"Another Day in Paradise\" \u2013 4:48\n#\"Heat on the Street\" \u2013 3:59\n\n'''3\" CD single'''\n# \"Another Day In Paradise\" 5:19\n# \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" 1:26\n# \"Heat on the Street\" 4:00\n\nVirgin - VSCD1233 (Martin H)\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Phil Collins]] - [[lead vocals]] and [[backing vocals]], [[synthesizers]], [[drum machine]] and [[electronic drums]] Simmons SDS 1000\n*[[David Crosby]] - backing vocals\n*[[Leland Sklar]] - [[electric bass|bass]]\n*[[Dominic Miller]] - [[classical guitar]] and [[electric guitar]]\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!Chart (1989\u20131990)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|11|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|2|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|1|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|chartid=6660|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|1|chartid=6628|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/80s/1989/M&M-1989-12-02.pdf|title=Top 10 Denmark|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=6|issue=48|page=11|date=2 December 1989|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|European Airplay Top 50 (''[[Music & Media]]'')<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1990/MM-1990-02-17.pdf|title=European Airplay Top 50|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|page=III|date=17 February 1990|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Finland ([[The Official Finnish Charts|Suomen virallinen lista]])<ref>{{cite book|first=Jake|last=Nyman|year=2005|title=Suomi soi 4: Suuri suomalainen listakirja|edition=1st|publisher=Tammi|location=Helsinki|isbn=951-31-2503-3|language=Finnish}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|8|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|1|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise|songid=2046|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|2|song=Another Day in Paradise|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n|Italy (''[[Musica e dischi]]'')<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/80s/1989/M&M-1989-12-16.pdf|title=Top 3 Singles in Europe|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=6|issue=50|page=11|date=16 December 1989|accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|2|year=1989|week=48|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|1|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|5|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|1|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n|Poland ([[Lista Przeboj\u00f3w Programu Trzeciego|LP3]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lp3.polskieradio.pl/notowania/?numer=408|title=Notowanie nr408|publisher=[[Lista Przeboj\u00f3w Programu Trzeciego|LP3]]|language=Polish|date=16 December 1989|accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Spain ([[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|AFYVE]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st|date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref> \n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n{{singlechart|Sweden|1|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Switzerland|1|artist=Phil Collins|song=Another Day in Paradise}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UK|2|date=19891118|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Phil Collins|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|1|artist=Phil Collins|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardmainstreamrock|7|artist=Phil Collins|accessdate=9 April 2019}}\n|-\n|Zimbabwe (ZIMA)<ref>* Zimbabwe.

Produced by Collins along with [[Hugh Padgham]], it was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from his number-one album ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989). As with his song for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], \"[[Man on the Corner]]\", the track has as its subject the problem of [[homelessness]];<ref name=Dean>{{cite book |title= Rock N' Roll Gold Rush |url= https://archive.org/details/rocknrollgoldrus00dean |url-access= registration |author=Maury Dean |year=2003 |publisher=Algora |isbn=0-87586-207-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/rocknrollgoldrus00dean/page/n75 60]}}</ref> as such, the song was a substantial departure from the [[Dance music|dance]]-[[pop music]] of his previous album, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985).\n\nCollins sings the song from a third-person perspective, as he observes a man crossing the street to ignore a homeless woman, and he implores listeners not to turn a blind eye to homelessness because, by drawing a religious allusion, \"it's just another day for you and me in [[paradise]]\". Collins also appeals directly to [[God]] by singing: \"Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do? Oh Lord, there must be something you can say.\"\n\nThe song was Collins' seventh and final [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No. 1 single, the last No. 1 single of the 1980s and the first No. 1 single of the 1990s. It was also a worldwide success, eventually becoming one of the most successful songs of his solo career. It won Collins and Padgham the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year#Recipients|Record of the Year]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1991 awards ceremony]], while it was also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year#Recipients|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance#Recipients|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video#Recipients|Best Music Video, Short Form]]. \"Another Day in Paradise\" also won an award for [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year#Winners and nominees|British Single]] at the [[1990 Brit Awards#Winners and nominees|1990 Brit Awards]]. Despite the awards gained following its release, the song also generated some controversy over its subject matter and has received a largely negative reaction from music critics.\n\nThe live performance of the song at the [[33rd Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]] by Collins and [[David Crosby]], who provided backing vocals on the track, was released on the 1994 album ''Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002IXZ/ |title=Grammy's Greatest Moments, Volume 1: Various Artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> In 2009, Collins's version was listed at 86th on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Greatest Songs of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-90.shtml |title=Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=1 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090425025152/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-90.shtml| archivedate= 25 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> \"Another Day in Paradise\" has since been covered by several artists, including [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], her brother [[Ray J]], Jam Tronik, [[Axxis]], [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]], and [[Hank Marvin]].\n\n==Chart performance==\nThe song was another massive hit for Collins. On 23 December 1989, it became his seventh ({{As of|2018|April|alt=and, to date, final}}) No. 1 single in the U.S.<ref name=Dean/> The song was also the final No. 1 song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at No. 1 for four weeks, which classifies the song as a hit from the 1990s as well. This song is notable for keeping [[Janet Jackson|Janet Jackson's]] \"[[Rhythm Nation]]\" from reaching No. 1. It also saw out the 1980s and saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The song had already reached No. 2 in the UK in November of that year. The single version is slightly different from the album version in that it uses a shorter intro.\n\n==Music video==\nThe song's music video was directed by Jim Yukich.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6668700/</ref> The video, shot entirely in black and white, features Collins singing in a dark background, interspersed with images of the homeless, the immigrants and the poverty of the chidrens in the streets. The music video also features many messages about the homeless, to convey the full message of the song.\n\n==Reception==\nMusic historian [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] wrote that \"Another Day in Paradise\" had been widely criticised.<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|date=14 Sep 2007|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music: Concise (5th Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=PA2006-IA1345&lpg=PA2006-IA1345&dq=%22the+widely+criticised+another+day+in+paradise%22&source=bl&ots=JbkVzlVh0q&sig=RQ-2rIR4x34EBnSdP0QgVlMVLmc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2Nz1U-fnOvLb7Abf0IFA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20widely%20criticised%20another%20day%20in%20paradise%22&f=false|publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]]|isbn=1846098564|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref> Collins addressed the criticism from the English rock press at the time of its release, who found him unqualified to sing about the poor due to his wealth, by saying: \"When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It's a misconception that if you have a lot of money you're somehow out of touch with reality.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/arts/the-pop-life-365789.html|title=The Pop Life|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=6 December 1989|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSinger-songwriter and political activist [[Billy Bragg]] was scathing of the song in an interview in 2000, drawing a contrast between Collins and a band he admired, [[the Clash]], stating: \"Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn't have the action to go with it he's just exploiting that for a subject.\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20260660,00.html | title= Bragg-ing Rites | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Rob | last=Brunner | date=30 June 2000 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> In 2003, [[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Andrew Collins]] described the song as a \"bland redress\" for the subject of homelessness in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194648 | title= Give music a chance | work=New Statesman | first=Andrew | last=Collins | date=24 February 2003 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' dismissed the track in 2007 as \"a song that addressed the issue of homelessness with the same insight as [[Melanie C|Sporty Spice]]'s '[[If That Were Me]]'\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/19/iwishidneverheardofphil | title= I wish I'd never heard of Phil Collins ... | work=The Guardian | first=Caroline | last=Sullivan | date=19 September 2007 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2010, David Sheppard described the song's lyrics as \"cringe-worthy\" and gave it as an example of Collins \"painting the bull's-eye on his own forehead\" when it came to his negative status with music critics.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/m9nv | title= Phil Collins Going Back Review | publisher=BBC | first=David | last=Sheppard | accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[MSN]] in 2013, Hugh Wilson contrasted Collins's concern for the homeless in the song with his concern as a multimillionaire at the prospect of the UK's election of a tax-raising [[socialism|socialist]] government. Referring to Collins's statement that he would consider leaving the UK with the election of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, Wilson noted that the song led to \"accusations of hypocrisy\" because Collins had \"bemoaned the plight of the homeless\" in it.

While the incumbent president, Donald Trump, is the nation's 45th president, he is only the 44th person to serve as president. This is because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th U.S. president. Thank you. --> people who have served as president, 24 have become the oldest such individual of their time, with one, William Howard Taft, doing so twice. Herbert Hoover held the distinction for the longest period of any, from the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933 until his own death 31 years later. Lyndon B. Johnson held it for the shortest, from the death of Harry S. Truman in December 1972 until his own death only 27 days later. Theodore Roosevelt, at age 49, is the youngest individual to become the oldest living president; Jimmy Carter became the oldest to acquire the distinction at age 94. (Nine of these individuals have also had the distinction of being the oldest living U.S. vice president: John Adams, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush.)\n\nOn three occasions the oldest living president lost the distinction not by his death, but by the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of a president who was older: Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) to William Howard Taft (born 1857) in 1909; Taft to Woodrow Wilson (born 1856) in 1913 (though Taft later regained the honor, as he outlived Wilson); and Richard Nixon (born 1913) to Ronald Reagan (born 1911) in 1981.\n\nEleven presidents have held the distinction while in office. In the cases of George Washington, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Ronald Reagan this occurred upon their inauguration as they were older than their living predecessors (or, in Washington's case, had no predecessors). In the cases of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon, this happened at the same time as their becoming the only living president; in the cases of Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Harrison, the only other living president at the time was a younger predecessor, John Quincy Adams and Grover Cleveland respectively. By contrast, the president who acquired the distinction furthest from his time in office was Jimmy Carter, who had been retired for {{ayd|1981|01|20|2018|11|30}} when he became the oldest living president, upon the death of George H.

While the incumbent president, Donald Trump, is the nation's 45th president, he is only the 44th person to serve as president. This is because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th U.S. president. Thank you. --> people who have served as president, 24 have become the oldest such individual of their time, with one, William Howard Taft, doing so twice. Herbert Hoover held the distinction for the longest period of any, from the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933 until his own death 31 years later. Lyndon B. Johnson held it for the shortest, from the death of Harry S. Truman in December 1972 until his own death only 27 days later. Theodore Roosevelt, at age 49, is the youngest individual to become the oldest living president; Jimmy Carter became the oldest to acquire the distinction at age 94. (Nine of these individuals have also had the distinction of being the oldest living U.S. vice president: John Adams, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush.)\n\nOn three occasions the oldest living president lost the distinction not by his death, but by the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of a president who was older: Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) to William Howard Taft (born 1857) in 1909; Taft to Woodrow Wilson (born 1856) in 1913 (though Taft later regained the honor, as he outlived Wilson); and Richard Nixon (born 1913) to Ronald Reagan (born 1911) in 1981.\n\nEleven presidents have held the distinction while in office. In the cases of George Washington, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Ronald Reagan this occurred upon their inauguration as they were older than their living predecessors (or, in Washington's case, had no predecessors). In the cases of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon, this happened at the same time as their becoming the only living president; in the cases of Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Harrison, the only other living president at the time was a younger predecessor, John Quincy Adams and Grover Cleveland respectively. By contrast, the president who acquired the distinction furthest from his time in office was Jimmy Carter, who had been retired for {{ayd|1981|01|20|2018|11|30}} when he became the oldest living president, upon the death of George H. W.

He undertakes the quest together with his thief partner Malak and Taramis' niece Jehnna and henchman Bombaata. On their journey they are joined by two additional allies whom Conan saves from dire fates; the magician Akiro and the female warrior Zula. At their goal, the castle of the wizard Amon-Rama, Jehnna is kidnapped. Thanks to Akiro's magic she is located in Amon-Rama's lair and a way in is discovered. Inside, Conan is separated from the others and forced to battle a Man-Ape in a hall of mirrors, which he is only able to defeat by destroying the mirrors. He also mortally wounds the wizard, who is hiding behind one of them. Jehnna, who is the only person who can safely handle the wizard's gem, retrieves the first magical item.\n\nAfterwards the group beats off an attack by Corinthian soldiers, and continues on to the fortress that holds the horn. It is retrieved at the cost of a battle with its Dagoth-worshipping keepers, whose leader Akiro defeats in a sorcerous duel. Bombaata and Jehnna escape through a tunnel, which the former closes to the others by starting a landslide. Back at Taramis' palace, the queen conducts a ritual to awaken Dagoth that entails the placing of the horn on the forehead of the sleeping deity, and ultimately the sacrifice of Jehnna. Conan, Akiro and Zula, having survived the landslide, interrupt the proceedings.\n\nConan fights and defeats Bombaata while Zula rescues Jehnna. In the absence of the sacrifice, Dagoth is an uncontrollable monster on his revival, eating Taramis and threatening the destruction of everything else. On the advice of Akiro, Conan rips the horn from Dagoth's forehead, and the creature finally falls. In the aftermath, Jehnna succeeds to the throne of Shadazar and takes Zula, Akiro, and Malak as advisors. She offers Conan her hand and a place at her side as king, but the Cimmerian prefers to win his own kingdom.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Don D'Ammassa]] writes \"The novelization of the second Conan movie contains none of the annoying inconsistencies of the first. ...

Howard]]'s seminal [[sword and sorcery]] hero [[Conan the Barbarian]], a [[novelization]] of the [[Conan the Destroyer|feature film]] of the same name. It was first published in paperback by [[Tor Books]] in 1984.<ref name=\"ISFDB\">{{isfdb title|id=9276 |title=Conan the Destroyer}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nQueen Taramis of Shadizar promises to bring Conan's lost love Valeria back to life if the Cimmerian will procure two magical items that she hopes will gain her ultimate power, a wizard's gem and a horn that can awaken the dreaming god Dagoth. He undertakes the quest together with his thief partner Malak and Taramis' niece Jehnna and henchman Bombaata. On their journey they are joined by two additional allies whom Conan saves from dire fates; the magician Akiro and the female warrior Zula. At their goal, the castle of the wizard Amon-Rama, Jehnna is kidnapped. Thanks to Akiro's magic she is located in Amon-Rama's lair and a way in is discovered. Inside, Conan is separated from the others and forced to battle a Man-Ape in a hall of mirrors, which he is only able to defeat by destroying the mirrors. He also mortally wounds the wizard, who is hiding behind one of them. Jehnna, who is the only person who can safely handle the wizard's gem, retrieves the first magical item.\n\nAfterwards the group beats off an attack by Corinthian soldiers, and continues on to the fortress that holds the horn. It is retrieved at the cost of a battle with its Dagoth-worshipping keepers, whose leader Akiro defeats in a sorcerous duel. Bombaata and Jehnna escape through a tunnel, which the former closes to the others by starting a landslide. Back at Taramis' palace, the queen conducts a ritual to awaken Dagoth that entails the placing of the horn on the forehead of the sleeping deity, and ultimately the sacrifice of Jehnna. Conan, Akiro and Zula, having survived the landslide, interrupt the proceedings.\n\nConan fights and defeats Bombaata while Zula rescues Jehnna. In the absence of the sacrifice, Dagoth is an uncontrollable monster on his revival, eating Taramis and threatening the destruction of everything else. On the advice of Akiro, Conan rips the horn from Dagoth's forehead, and the creature finally falls. In the aftermath, Jehnna succeeds to the throne of Shadazar and takes Zula, Akiro, and Malak as advisors. She offers Conan her hand and a place at her side as king, but the Cimmerian prefers to win his own kingdom.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Don D'Ammassa]] writes \"The novelization of the second Conan movie contains none of the annoying inconsistencies of the first. ...

As a person in show business, his paychecks were never steady, and he  traveled from home  for months at a time.

Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the school's talent shows. He won the \"Best Personality\" superlative voted by his classmates.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} He enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]], where he studied sports broadcasting and joined the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. In college, he was known for a few pranks. On occasion, he would dress in a janitor's outfit and stroll into his friends' classes. He was also known for [[streaking]] around campus with a few other people from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} Ferrell earned an internship at a local television station in the sports department, but he did not enjoy the work.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=56}}\n\nAfter graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in sports information in 1990, he knew he did not want to do broadcasting.

He also worked as a teller at [[Wells Fargo]], but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not stealing the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles.

He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was [[Harry Caray]], the [[Ford C. Frick Award|Hall of Fame]] baseball announcer. Soon he began to create original characters. With fellow Groundlings member [[Chris Kattan]], they created the Butabi Brothers, who go out to dance clubs to try to pick up women but are constantly rejected. While taking classes, Ferrell got a job at an auction house via his friend Viveca Paulin. The job was ideal as it was flexible enough for him to audition and go to rehearsals while also being employed. He received small roles, including TV series ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'' and ''[[Living Single]]'', low-budget films such as ''[[A Bucket of Blood (1995 film)|A Bucket of Blood]]'', as well as commercials. One winter, he served as a mall Santa Claus.

He received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for his work on ''Saturday Night Live'', and three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for acting in ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]'' (2005) and ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' (2006) and for producing ''[[Vice (2018 film)|Vice]]'' (2018).

Ferrell said of the divorce: \"I was the type of kid who would say, 'Hey, look at the bright side! We'll have two Christmases'.\" The divorce was amicable, and both parents were committed to their children. The biggest problem was his father's line of work. As a person in show business, his paychecks were never steady, and he  traveled from home  for months at a time. Growing up in this environment made Ferrell not want to go into show business and instead have a steady job.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=54}}\n\nWill first attended school at Culverdale Elementary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/story/will-ferrell-sets-the-record-straight-on-internet-rumors-about-will-ferrell|title=Will Ferrell sets the record straight on internet rumors about Will Ferrell|website=news.vice.com|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}</ref> and later attended [[Rancho San Joaquin Middle School]], both in Irvine.

Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the school's talent shows. He won the \"Best Personality\" superlative voted by his classmates.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} He enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]], where he studied sports broadcasting and joined the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. In college, he was known for a few pranks. On occasion, he would dress in a janitor's outfit and stroll into his friends' classes. He was also known for [[streaking]] around campus with a few other people from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} Ferrell earned an internship at a local television station in the sports department, but he did not enjoy the work.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=56}}\n\nAfter graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in sports information in 1990, he knew he did not want to do broadcasting. He took up a job as a hotel valet where, on his second day, he tore a baggage rack off the top of a van by trying to drive it under a low beam. He also worked as a teller at [[Wells Fargo]], but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not stealing the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles. He successfully auditioned for the comedy group [[The Groundlings]], where he spent time developing his [[Improvisational comedy|improvisation skills]].{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=56}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===''The Groundlings''===\n\nBefore joining The Groundlings, Ferrell's attempts at standup comedy had little success. He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was [[Harry Caray]], the [[Ford C. Frick Award|Hall of Fame]] baseball announcer. Soon he began to create original characters. With fellow Groundlings member [[Chris Kattan]], they created the Butabi Brothers, who go out to dance clubs to try to pick up women but are constantly rejected. While taking classes, Ferrell got a job at an auction house via his friend Viveca Paulin. The job was ideal as it was flexible enough for him to audition and go to rehearsals while also being employed. He received small roles, including TV series ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'' and ''[[Living Single]]'', low-budget films such as ''[[A Bucket of Blood (1995 film)|A Bucket of Blood]]'', as well as commercials. One winter, he served as a mall Santa Claus.

What makes him so bad is that he'll taunt people asking for his autograph.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesuperficial.com/2007/12/will_ferrell_named_worst_autog.php |title=Will Ferrell named worst autograph signer |publisher=The Superficial |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> In response, Ferrell stated: \"I don't know how I got on the list. I sign a lot of autographs.\" He has, however, admitted to taunting autograph-seekers: \"I do. I really do. I'm like, 'How badly do you want this autograph?' 'Are you sure?' 'You say you're my biggest fan, really, prove it.' I'll do things like that. They have to earn it.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rabin, Nathan [https://avclub.com/content/interview/will_ferrell Interview: Will Ferrell], ''The A.V.

Bush]], he chose, for both professional and political reasons, not to meet the President on several occasions, unlike his SNL predecessor [[Dana Carvey]]'s famous relationship with [[George H. W. Bush]]: \"I declined, partly out of comedic purposes, because when I was on the show ''Saturday Night Live'' at the time, it didn't make sense to really meet the people that you play, for fear of them influencing you. And then the other side of it is, from a political standpoint, I don't want to meet that guy.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Ferrell also appeared on an episode of ''[[Man vs. Wild]]'', where he traveled throughout the tundras of Sweden with the show's host, [[Bear Grylls]].

He was introduced as Billy Ray \"Rojo\" Johnson, and was brought in to relief pitch for the sixth inning. He then entertained the fans by bringing a sack of beer cans to the mound, as well as being ejected and getting chased by the opposing batter. He revealed himself to the fans when his moustache fell off during the chase. The appearance was cooked up by Ferrell and the Express, who sent out a press release announcing Johnson's \"signing\" to promote The Will Powered Golf Classic the following day at the nearby Cimarron Hills Country Club, which benefits Cancer for College, an organization that provides scholarships to cancer survivors.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Newman and Brian McTaggart|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100507&content_id=9865792&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb/ |title=Will Ferrell pitches, entertains in Round Rock |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012,  while in Australia promoting ''The Campaign'', Ferrell made a guest appearance on the channel 10 live panel news/comedy show [[The Project (Australian TV program)|''The Project'']].

The BHL consortium works with the international taxonomic community, rights holders, and other interested parties to ensure that this biodiversity heritage is made available to a global audience through open access principles.

The principal is Dr. Lori Wiggins. In 2012\u201313, there were over 800 students enrolled and more than 80 teachers (41 of whom have their [[Master's Degree]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} It is accredited through the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]]. The school was originally called Brandon Junior High. In 1957 the school was renamed Gunston Junior High, named after Gunston Hall,  the home of [[George Mason]], the estate is nearby in [[Fairfax County]].\n\nGunston's mascot is the ''Hornet.'' The school colors are purple and teal. Sports teams include basketball, soccer, wrestling, swimming, track, and tennis.\n\nGunston's curriculum includes the continuation program for students who attended the Key Elementary or the Claremont Elementary Spanish Immersion program.  Students in this program take three classes each day taught entirely in Spanish: Science, Social Studies and Spanish Language Arts.  About 1/3 of the incoming 6th graders come from the Key or Claremont programs. Most people attending Gunston will attend Wakefield High School after graduating from 8th grade.\n\nThe school, at the time, called Gunston Junior High School and encompassing grades 7, 8, and 9, closed in 1978 after a major decline in enrollments. At the time of its closure, the school mascot was the Falcon, and the school colors were black and gold. Gunston reopened in 1994 to address overcrowding in other area schools.

One of two North Arlington junior highs targeted for closure in 1977 due to declining enrollment, Swanson reopened as an intermediate school the following year, and the 9th graders were transferred to W-L and [[Yorktown High School (Virginia)|Yorktown]] high schools. Stratford Junior High, although a newer facility, closed its doors. In the fall of 1990, Swanson once again housed three grades as a middle school.

Swanson]], was [[Secretary of the Navy]], and never an \"Admiral.\" They wear white and maroon.\n\nIn 1977, a student reportedly started a fire in the school as a prank, and ultimately burning the majority of the roof, including its cupola (a small dome-shaped structure crowning the roof). The student was expelled. Later that year, an unknown student or group of students repeatedly set off the fire alarms as a prank, costing Swanson hundreds of dollars in fines for abusing firemen's' time.

It is the oldest \"junior high\" in the state. Because of its unique contribution to education in Virginia as well as its Parisian architecture,{{clarify|what the heck is \"Parisian architecture\"? French architecture?|date=February 2011}} inspired by the then recently restored [[Colonial Williamsburg]], the school is pursuing its listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In recognition of the school's history, the Virginia State Legislature passed a resolution on Swanson's 50th anniversary in 1990 proclaiming Swanson as Virginia's first junior high school.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">(2000) \"Washington-Lee High School 75th Anniversary History\"</ref>\n\nIt was constructed with WPA funds on the site of the old Torreyson farm in the growing [[Westover, Arlington, Virginia|Westover]] community. One of two North Arlington junior highs targeted for closure in 1977 due to declining enrollment, Swanson reopened as an intermediate school the following year, and the 9th graders were transferred to W-L and [[Yorktown High School (Virginia)|Yorktown]] high schools. Stratford Junior High, although a newer facility, closed its doors. In the fall of 1990, Swanson once again housed three grades as a middle school. It has undergone several renovations, with the most recent in 2017.   \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Demographics<ref>Information about Swanson Middle School on the ''Local School Profile'' {{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.k12.va.us/schools/lsr/swanson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202140601/http://www.arlington.k12.va.us/schools/lsr/swanson.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }}</ref>\n|-\n!

Upon entering the main entrance of the school, the administrative offices are to the left and the library is further down the long hall. Here, the three corridors extend themselves to another long hall in which various classrooms are located. Also, three individual staircases are located that lead students to a lower level where lockers are located in individual lobbies. The sixth grade lobby is green, the seventh grade lobby is yellow, and the eighth grade lobby is blue. The sixth and seven grade lobbies are also used as cafeteria seating with the kitchen in the middle. These two lobbies also have small corridors that lead to the school gymnasium. It was renovated in 2010. In 2018 a new elementary school by the name of Alice Fleet is being built right next to the old entrance to the school's lobby.\n\nJefferson was designed for use as not only a school but also for community recreation, with the second-largest gymnasium in the state and a community theater that can seat 715 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novaopera.org/directions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427112952/http://novaopera.org/directions.html |archivedate=2007-04-27 |df= }} ''Opera Theatre of Northern Virginia''</ref> The school district works with the local Division of Parks, Recreation and Community Resources to share the facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.k12.va.us/schools/brochure/jefferson.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212160338/http://www.arlington.k12.va.us/schools/brochure/jefferson.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-12 |df= }} Arlington Public Schools Web site</ref>\n\nThe school's gymnasium is actually a part of the Thomas Jefferson Community Center.

The school colors are white and blue.\n\nThere are three teams in each grade (three teams in eighth) along with a separate team (Rockets) for ESOL students. The 6th grade teams consist of the Panthers, Coyotes, and Grizzlies. The 7th grade teams are the Mystics, Capitols, and the Wizards; all based on Washington DC sports teams.  The 8th grade teams are based on college mascots in Virginia, and are Patriots, Cavaliers, and Hokies. Outside, there is one field currently, a baseball diamond, one tennis court and a blacktop with a basketball court and four square. There is a multi-usage weight room, an auxiliary gym and the main gym. In 2013, APS (Arlington Public Schools) started construction on a new elementary school on the WMS campus. The elementary school was named by a naming committee selected by the APS School Board, and is called Discovery Elementary School.

Both a governing body and an advocacy group, Student Government is involved in policy-making, adjudication, programming, advocating, community service, and countless other activities. The organization is a clearinghouse for concerns from students and answers from administrators. The organization also is responsible for distributing a portion of the fees it receives to student organizations in a process known as appropriations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |title=Description of the NC State Student Government. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926234901/http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe student government at NC State is composed of three branches, and headed by four student body officers (SBOs). The student body president heads the executive branch. The president executes policy passed by the senate and is a member of the NC State board of trustees. The president runs for office and serves with a student body vice president, who assumes the presidency if that office becomes vacant. The student senate is a 64-member body that considers legislative policy on behalf of the students of the university. It is headed by the student senate president, who serves as the executive student body vice president. The Senate is also responsible for approving the annual Student Government budget. The budget is drafted each year by the Student Body Treasurer who oversees the monetary status of the entirety of Student Government and as such is a member of both the Legislative and Executive branches. The student chief justice heads the [[judicial branch]] and is the only member of that branch elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |title=NC State's Judicial Branch. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926235109/http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Student traditions===\n====Service NC State====\nService NC State (SNCS) is sponsored by the Center for Student Leadership, Ethics & Public Service as the definitive service event to welcome new students to NC State's campus, and as a way to impact the community.

Both a governing body and an advocacy group, Student Government is involved in policy-making, adjudication, programming, advocating, community service, and countless other activities. The organization is a clearinghouse for concerns from students and answers from administrators. The organization also is responsible for distributing a portion of the fees it receives to student organizations in a process known as appropriations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |title=Description of the NC State Student Government. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926234901/http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe student government at NC State is composed of three branches, and headed by four student body officers (SBOs). The student body president heads the executive branch. The president executes policy passed by the senate and is a member of the NC State board of trustees. The president runs for office and serves with a student body vice president, who assumes the presidency if that office becomes vacant. The student senate is a 64-member body that considers legislative policy on behalf of the students of the university. It is headed by the student senate president, who serves as the executive student body vice president. The Senate is also responsible for approving the annual Student Government budget. The budget is drafted each year by the Student Body Treasurer who oversees the monetary status of the entirety of Student Government and as such is a member of both the Legislative and Executive branches. The student chief justice heads the [[judicial branch]] and is the only member of that branch elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |title=NC State's Judicial Branch. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926235109/http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Student traditions===\n====Service NC State====\nService NC State (SNCS) is sponsored by the Center for Student Leadership, Ethics & Public Service as the definitive service event to welcome new students to NC State's campus, and as a way to impact the community.
