Clarke's early years were spent in India with his parents. He was later brought up by his paternal grandfather and two uncles, one of whom was the father of [[Marcus Clarke]], at the family home of Belmont, near [[Lifford]], Ireland. He was educated at [[The King's School, Canterbury]], and at [[Portora Royal School]] at [[Enniskillen]], [[Ireland]]. At 16 he entered the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], where one of his teachers was [[Michael Faraday]].<ref name=adb/>\n\n==Career==\nGraduating in 1844, Clarke was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the [[Royal Engineers]] and after a year of further study at [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] was sent to [[Fermoy]] in Ireland. In 1846 he was nominated to the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon Boundary Commission]]; his father, who was then governor of [[Western Australia]], urged him instead to come to Australia with the hope of later gaining a professional post with him. As a lieutenant in command of a detachment of Royal Engineers, Clarke sailed with the new lieutenant-governor, [[William Denison|Sir William Denison]], aboard the ''Windermere'' and arrived at [[Hobart]] on 26 January 1847. His father's death the following next month left Clarke with little reason to remain in Australia but he continued to superintend convict labour and to survey the area around Hobart and design wharf accommodation and became friends with William Denison.<ref name=adb/>\n\nClarke's next tour of duty was in [[New Zealand]] with governor [[George Grey|Sir George Grey]], from September 1848. He and his detachment worked mainly on road building, and Clarke discovered his gift for dealing with native peoples when he was sent on a peace-making mission to the [[Bay of Islands]].<ref name=adb/>\n\nIn 1849 Clarke returned to Hobart to become private secretary to William Denison, [[Governor]] of [[Tasmania]] and [[New South Wales]], and was also an official nominee in the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] in 1851\u201353 and controller of the [[mounted police]].<ref name=adb/>\n\nIn March 1853 Clarke was asked to replace [[Robert Hoddle]] as [[Surveyor General of Victoria]] and arrived at [[Melbourne]] in May. His hard work and energy resulted in more land being sold in the next 18 months than in the years since 1836. He also established the Roads Boards that preceded the introduction of local government and was responsible for much of the planning of Victoria's first railways. His proposals for a government-controlled railway system were examined by a select committee and were made law in 1857. Additionally, he set up the first electric telegraph from Melbourne to [[Williamstown, Victoria]] and was able to report in November 1857 that the service had reached the borders of New South Wales and [[South Australia]].<ref name=adb/> In 1855 he was elected the inaugural president of the [[Philosophical Institute of Victoria]].<ref>[http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Philosophical_Institute_of_Victoria.htm Office Bearers of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria  Burke & Wills Web : the digital research archive]</ref>\n\nClarke entered the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] in August 1853 as an official representative, where he was active in the drafting of the new constitution. He was also responsible for the drafting and successful inauguration of the Municipal Institutions Act in December 1854, which provided for local government based on the English model in Melbourne's growing suburbs, on the goldfields, and in the country.<ref name=adb/>\n\nAt the 1856 elections, Clarke mounted a successful campaign against [[David Blair (encyclopedist)|David Blair]] for the [[Electoral district of South Melbourne|South Melbourne]] seat in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]], which he held until he left the colony. He joined the first cabinet under [[William Haines (Australian politician)|William Haines]], as Surveyor-General and Commissioner for Lands.<ref name=adb/>\n\nIn March 1858 Clarke was appointed permanent head of the Lands and Surveys Department and decided to return to England. In London, he tried and failed to secure the governorship of [[Queensland]] and spent some months on barrack duty at [[Colchester]].<ref name=adb/>\n\nFrom 1859 to 1864 Clarke served in the African colony of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and in England, where he was Director of Works at the [[Admiralty]] from 1864\u20131873.<ref name=adb/> During this period he co-authored a report on the Suez Canal with [[George Henry Richards]], Hydrographer to the Admiralty<ref>{{cite journal|first1=George Henry|last1=Richards|first2=Andrew|last2=Clarke|title=Report on the Suez Canal|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London|date=1869|volume=14|issue=3|pages=259\u2013273|jstor=1799058|doi=10.2307/1799058}}</ref>\n\n===Governor of the Straits Settlements===\n[[File:Bust of Sir Andrew Clarke, Victoria Concert Hall, Singapore - 20141101-01.JPG|thumb|upright|A bust of Clarke in [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall|Victoria Concert Hall]], Singapore]]\n\nSir Andrew Clarke served as the Governor of Singapore and the [[Governor of the Straits Settlements]] from 4 November 1873 until 8 May 1875. Clarke played a key role in positioning Singapore as the main port for the [[British Malaya|Malay]] states of [[Perak]], [[Selangor]] and [[Sungei Ujong]].\n\nDue to his contributions, [[Singapore]]'s [[Clarke Quay]] was named after him. Clarke Street, located next to Clarke Quay, was officially named in 1896 and was originally two streets known simply as East Street and West Street in north Kampong Malacca. Today it is a pedestrian mall and a popular nightspot.\n\n====Pangkor Treaty====\n{{See also|Pangkor Treaty of 1874}}\nAs [[Governor of the Straits Settlements]], Clarke was famous for signing the [[Treaty of Pangkor]] in 1874, which established indirect British rule over the [[Malay States]]. In that same year, Clarke successfully enforced a check on the abuse of [[coolie]]s with support of the prominent Chinese leaders and European merchants. Clarke achieved fame through his negotiations in regard to [[Sungai Ujong|Sungei Ujong]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]], sorting out the differences between different leaders in [[Negeri Sembilan]].\n\nClarke was blamed for the death of the first British [[Resident (title)|resident]] in [[Perak]], [[James Wheeler Woodford Birch]], due to his ignorance of a complaint, when [[Abdullah Muhammad Shah II of Perak|Sultan Abdullah of Perak]] wrote a letter to inform him about Birch's rudeness against the [[Malay states|Malay]] rulers, because at that time he was about to retire and did not want that problem to destroy his reputation as one of the most successful colonial administrators.\n\n====Klang War====\n{{See also|Klang War}}\nClarke was instrumental in determining the outcome of the Klang War which took place from 1867 to 1874 as well as placing [[Selangor]] under British protection.\n\nThe [[Straits Settlements]] were becoming increasingly dependent on the economy of Selangor. Selangor through the 19th and the 20th was one of the world's major tin producers. Since Selangor's security affected tin trade, the British felt it needed to have a say in Selangor politics. The British saw Tengku Kudin as a ticket to reach out to Selangor's royal court. Therefore, the [[Straits Settlements]] led by Clarke implicitly supported Tengku Kudin in the war.\n\nThroughout the war, Tengku Kudin brought in soldiers from [[Kedah]] and [[Pahang]] along with mercenaries and [[Europe]]an officers from the [[Straits Settlements]]. The end result was a victory for Tengku Kudin.\n\nWhile the British through Clarke was on Tengku Kudin's side, the post-war situation had weakened Tengku Kudin's power base due to the Selangor royal family's suspicion of Tengku Kudin and the British. Therefore, Andrew Clarke was forced to freeze the plan to reach out to the royal family through Tengku Kudin.\n\nIn November 1873 however, a ship from Penang was attacked by pirates near [[Kuala Langat]], [[Selangor]]. After a number of piracy attacks took place in Selangor, Andrew Clarke assigned [[Frank Swettenham]] as a live-in advisor to [[Sultan Abdul Samad]] in August 1874. Sultan Abdul Samad accepted [[James Guthrie Davidson]], a lawyer from [[Singapore]], as the first [[British Resident]] of Selangor in 1875. In October the same year, Sultan Abdul Samad sent a letter to Andrew Clarke requesting for Selangor to be placed under the British [[protectorate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Perisytiharan Pentadbiran Inggeris di Selangor |url=http://www.arkib.gov.my/hids/readarticle.php?article_id=3124 |date=3 December 2008 |publisher=National Archives of Malaysia |accessdate=29 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"andaya\">{{Cite book | author= Andaya, B.W. | title = A History of Malaysia | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-312-38121-9 | postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n===Further service===\n[[File:Sir Andrew Clarke WDL11454.png|thumb|Sir Andrew Clarke during the Second Anglo-Afghan War]]\nFrom 1875 to 1880 Clarke was on the council of the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]].

Clarke retained an interest in the Australian colonies, and briefly acted as [[Agent-General#List of Agents-General for Victoria|Agent-General for Victoria]] in 1886, 1891, and 1893, before being appointed agent-general in 1899, which post he held until his death.\n\nClarke also served as a director of [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]], the [[Colonial Mutual|Colonial Life Assurance Society]], the Delhi-Umbala Railway Co. and the [[North Borneo Chartered Company|British North Borneo Company]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Parkinson |first=C.

Therefore, Andrew Clarke was forced to freeze the plan to reach out to the royal family through Tengku Kudin.\n\nIn November 1873 however, a ship from Penang was attacked by pirates near [[Kuala Langat]], [[Selangor]]. After a number of piracy attacks took place in Selangor, Andrew Clarke assigned [[Frank Swettenham]] as a live-in advisor to [[Sultan Abdul Samad]] in August 1874. Sultan Abdul Samad accepted [[James Guthrie Davidson]], a lawyer from [[Singapore]], as the first [[British Resident]] of Selangor in 1875. In October the same year, Sultan Abdul Samad sent a letter to Andrew Clarke requesting for Selangor to be placed under the British [[protectorate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Perisytiharan Pentadbiran Inggeris di Selangor |url=http://www.arkib.gov.my/hids/readarticle.php?article_id=3124 |date=3 December 2008 |publisher=National Archives of Malaysia |accessdate=29 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"andaya\">{{Cite book | author= Andaya, B.W. | title = A History of Malaysia | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-312-38121-9 | postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n===Further service===\n[[File:Sir Andrew Clarke WDL11454.png|thumb|Sir Andrew Clarke during the Second Anglo-Afghan War]]\nFrom 1875 to 1880 Clarke was on the council of the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]].

His oldest child, Winifred Dodge, married real estate baron [[Wesson Seyburn]], who built his own country retreat {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of Auburn Heights. The estate included hunting land, dog kennels, a swimming pool, horse stables, and a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Colonial Revival]] house. Pontiac Township purchased the estate in 1976, and adapted the buildings for government use. Today, it is known as the Auburn Hills Civic Center.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Auburn Hills,\" in 1964, was by [[Oakland Community College]]. They named their campus (a former [[Project Nike|Nike missile base]]) at Featherstone and Squirrel roads for the town and the hilly terrain in the area. Besides Oakland Community College, three other colleges, [[Oakland University]], [[Baker College]], and [[Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] have campuses partially within the city limits.\n\n=== Incorporation history ===\nAuburn Hills began as Pontiac Township, including the village of Auburn, in 1821, at what is today the corner of Auburn and Squirrel roads. Situated on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], it was named by Aaron Webster, the first settler, for [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His sawmill and grist mill attracted settlers to Auburn. After the streets were laid out in 1826, Auburn rivaled nearby [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] until the 1860s, when it lost its own prosperity. The town was renamed Amy in 1880, and it officially became Auburn Heights in 1919. Pontiac Township bordered the city of Pontiac on two sides. The township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] merged with the village of Auburn Heights to become the City of Auburn Hills. It is not to be confused with the similarly named city of [[Auburn, Michigan]], that exists in [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay County]], near [[Saginaw Bay]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|16.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (0.24%) is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 111\n|1990= 17076\n|2000= 19837\n|2010= 21412\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24042\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,412 people, 8,844 households, and 4,923 families living in the city.

His oldest child, Winifred Dodge, married real estate baron [[Wesson Seyburn]], who built his own country retreat {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of Auburn Heights. The estate included hunting land, dog kennels, a swimming pool, horse stables, and a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Colonial Revival]] house. Pontiac Township purchased the estate in 1976, and adapted the buildings for government use. Today, it is known as the Auburn Hills Civic Center.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Auburn Hills,\" in 1964, was by [[Oakland Community College]]. They named their campus (a former [[Project Nike|Nike missile base]]) at Featherstone and Squirrel roads for the town and the hilly terrain in the area. Besides Oakland Community College, three other colleges, [[Oakland University]], [[Baker College]], and [[Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] have campuses partially within the city limits.\n\n=== Incorporation history ===\nAuburn Hills began as Pontiac Township, including the village of Auburn, in 1821, at what is today the corner of Auburn and Squirrel roads. Situated on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], it was named by Aaron Webster, the first settler, for [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His sawmill and grist mill attracted settlers to Auburn. After the streets were laid out in 1826, Auburn rivaled nearby [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] until the 1860s, when it lost its own prosperity. The town was renamed Amy in 1880, and it officially became Auburn Heights in 1919. Pontiac Township bordered the city of Pontiac on two sides. The township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] merged with the village of Auburn Heights to become the City of Auburn Hills. It is not to be confused with the similarly named city of [[Auburn, Michigan]], that exists in [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay County]], near [[Saginaw Bay]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|16.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 111\n|1990= 17076\n|2000= 19837\n|2010= 21412\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24042\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,412 people, 8,844 households, and 4,923 families living in the city.

The availability of land and literate labor, the absence of a landed aristocracy, the prestige of entrepreneurship, the diversity of climate and a large easily accessed upscale and literate free market all contributed to America's rapid [[industrialization]]. The availability of capital, development by the free market of navigable rivers, and coastal waterways, and the abundance of natural resources facilitated the cheap extraction of energy all contributed to America's rapid industrialization. Fast transport by the very large railroad built in the mid-19th century, and the [[Interstate Highway System]] built in the late 20th century, enlarged the markets and reduced shipping and production costs. The legal system facilitated business operations and guaranteed contracts. Cut off from Europe by the embargo and the British blockade in the [[War of 1812]] (1807\u201315), entrepreneurs opened factories in the Northeast that set the stage for rapid industrialization modeled on British innovations.\n\nFrom its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has encouraged science and innovation. As a result, the United States has been the birthplace of 161 of Britannica's 321 Greatest Inventions, including items such as the airplane, internet, [[microchip]], laser, [[cellphone]], refrigerator, email, microwave, [[personal computer]], [[Liquid-crystal display]] and [[light-emitting diode]] technology, air conditioning, [[assembly line]], supermarket, [[bar code]], [[automated teller machine]], and many more.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica [https://web.archive.org/web/20060513185450/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html \"Greatest Inventions\"], ''Britannica Corporate'', Published 5/13/2006. Retrieved 7/10/2017.</ref>\n\nThe early technological and industrial development in the United States was facilitated by a unique confluence of geographical, social, and economic factors. The relative lack of workers kept the United States wages nearly always higher than corresponding British and European workers and provided an incentive to mechanize some tasks. The United States population had some semi-unique advantages in that they were former British subjects, had high English literacy skills, for that period (over 80% in New England), had strong British institutions, with some minor American modifications, of courts, laws, right to vote, protection of property rights and in many cases personal contacts among the British innovators of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. They had a good basic structure to build on. Another major advantage, which the British lacked, was no inherited aristocratic institutions. The eastern seaboard of the United States, with a great number of rivers and streams along the Atlantic seaboard, provided many potential sites for constructing textile mills necessary for early industrialization. The technology and information on how to build a textile industry were largely provided by [[Samuel Slater]] (1768\u20131835) who emigrated to New England in 1789. He had studied and worked in British textile mills for a number of years and immigrated to the United States, despite restrictions against it, to try his luck with U.S. manufacturers who were trying to set up a textile industry. He was offered a full partnership if he could succeed\u2014he did. A vast supply of natural resources, the technological knowledge on how to build and power the necessary machines along with a labor supply of mobile workers, often unmarried females, all aided early industrialization. The broad knowledge carried by European migrants of two periods that advanced the societies there, namely the European Industrial Revolution and European [[Scientific revolution]], helped facilitate understanding for the construction and invention of new manufacturing businesses and technologies. A limited government that would allow them to succeed or fail on their own merit helped.\n\nAfter the close of the American Revolution in 1783, the new government continued the strong property rights established under British rule and established a rule of law necessary to protect those property rights. The idea of issuing [[patents]] was incorporated into Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizing Congress \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" The invention of the [[Cotton Gin]] by American [[Eli Whitney]] made cotton potentially a cheap and readily available resource in the United States for use in the new textile industry.\n\nOne of the real impetuses for the United States entering the Industrial Revolution was the passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], the [[War of 1812]] (1812\u201314) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u201315) which cut off supplies of new and cheaper Industrial revolution products from Britain. The lack of access to these goods all provided a strong incentive to learn how to develop the industries and to make their own goods instead of simply buying the goods produced by Britain.\n\nModern productivity researchers have shown that the period in which the greatest economic and technological progress occurred was between the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kendrick |first1=John |title=U.S. Productivity Performance in Perspective, Business Economics, October 1, 1991 |year=1991 |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/finance/262030-1.html |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"Field 2004\">{{cite web |last1=Field |first1=Alexander |title=Technological Change and Economic Growth the Interwar Years and the 1990s |year=2004 |url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/echist/eh04/field-041006.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310163302/http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/echist/eh04/field-041006.pdf |archivedate=March 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Field |first1=Alezander J.|title=U.S. Economic Growth in the Gilded Age, Journal of Macroeconomics 31 |year=2007|pages=173\u2013190 |ref=harv}}</ref> During this period the nation was transformed from an agricultural economy to the foremost industrial power in the world, with more than a third of the global industrial output. This can be illustrated by the index of total industrial production, which increased from 4.29 in 1790 to 1,975.00 in 1913, an increase of 460 times (base year 1850 \u2013 100).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/data/industrial-production-index/ip-total.html |title=Industrial Production Index |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>\n\nAmerican colonies [[American Revolution|gained independence]] in 1783 just as profound changes in industrial production and coordination were beginning to [[First Industrial Revolution|shift production]] from artisans to factories. Growth of the nation's transportation infrastructure with [[internal improvements]] and a confluence of technological innovations before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] facilitated an expansion in organization, coordination, and [[Second Industrial Revolution|scale of industrial production]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, American industry had superseded its European counterparts economically and the nation began to assert its [[Military history of the United States|military power]]. Although the [[Great Depression]] challenged its [[technological momentum]], America emerged from it and [[World War II]] as one of two global [[superpower]]s. In the second half of the 20th century, as the United States was drawn into competition with the [[Soviet Union]] for [[Cold War|political, economic, and military primacy]], the government invested heavily in scientific research and technological development which spawned advances in [[spaceflight]], [[computing]], and [[biotechnology]].\n\nScience, technology, and industry have not only profoundly shaped America's economic success, but have also contributed to its distinct political institutions, social structure, educational system, and cultural identity.\n\n==Pre-European technology==\n{{see also|Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[File:Monks Mound in July.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Monk's Mound is a large structure built by the indigenous peoples in the Plains.]]\nNorth America has been inhabited continuously since approximately 4,000 BC. The earliest inhabitants were [[nomad]]ic, big-game [[hunter-gatherer]]s who crossed the [[Bering land bridge]]. These first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] relied upon chipped-stone [[spear]]heads, rudimentary [[harpoon]]s, and boats clad in animal hides for hunting in the [[Arctic]]. As they dispersed within the continent, they encountered the varied temperate climates in the Pacific northwest, central plains, Appalachian woodlands, and arid Southwest, where they began to make permanent settlements. The peoples living in the Pacific northwest built wooden houses, used [[net (device)|nets]] and [[Fishing weir|weirs]] to catch fish, and practiced [[food preservation]] to ensure longevity of their food sources, since substantial agriculture was not developed.<ref>{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |pages=7\u20138 |isbn=0-19-504606-4}}</ref> Peoples living on the plains remained largely nomadic (some practiced agriculture for parts of the year) and became adept [[leather|leather workers]] as they hunted [[American bison|buffalo]] while people living in the arid southwest built [[adobe]] buildings, fired [[pottery]], domesticated [[cotton]], and [[loom|wove cloth]]. Tribes in the eastern woodlands and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian Valley]] developed extensive trade networks, built [[Mound builder (people)|pyramid-like mounds]], and practiced substantial agriculture while the peoples living in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and coastal Atlantic practiced highly sustainable forest agriculture and were expert woodworkers. However, the populations of these peoples were small and their rate of technological change was very low.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=10}}</ref> Indigenous peoples did not [[domestication|domesticate]] animals for [[draft animal|drafting]] or [[husbandry]], develop writing systems, or create [[bronze]] or [[iron]]-based tools like their European/Asian counterparts.\n\n==Colonial era==\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agricultural history of the United States}}\nIn the 17th century, [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], [[Puritans]], and [[Quakers]] fleeing religious persecution in Europe brought with them [[plowshare]]s, [[gun]]s, and domesticated animals like [[cow]]s and [[pig]]s. These immigrants and other European colonists initially farmed subsistence crops like [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]], and [[oats]] as well as rendering [[potash]] and [[maple syrup]] for trade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=30}}</ref> Due to the more temperate climate, large-scale [[plantations in the American South]] grew labor-intensive cash crops like [[sugarcane]], [[rice]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]] requiring native and imported African slave labor to maintain. Early American farmers were not self-sufficient; they relied upon other farmers, specialized craftsmen, and merchants to provide tools, process their harvests, and bring them to market.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=40\u201343}}</ref>\n\n===Artisanship===\nColonial artisanship emerged slowly as the market for advanced craftsmanship was small. American artisans developed a more relaxed (less regulated) version of the Old World apprenticeship system for educating and employing the next generation. Despite the fact that [[mercantilist]], export-heavy economy impaired the emergence of a robust self-sustaining economy, craftsmen and merchants developed a growing interdependence on each other for their trades.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=63\u201365}}</ref> In the mid-18th century, attempts by the British to subdue or control the colonies by means of taxation sowed increased discontent among these artisans, who increasingly joined the Patriot cause.\n\n===Silver working===\nColonial Virginia provided a potential market of rich plantations. At least 19 silversmiths worked in Williamsburg between 1699 and 1775. The best-known were James Eddy (1731\u20131809) and his brother-in-law William Wadill, also an engraver. Most planters, however, purchased English-made silver.<ref>Harold Gill, \"Colonial Silver and Silversmiths,\" ''Virginia Cavalcade'' (1970) 18#3 pp 5\u201313.</ref>\n\nIn Boston, goldsmiths and silversmiths were stratified. The most prosperous were merchant-artisans, with a business outlook and high status. Most craftsmen were laboring artisans who either operated small shops or, more often, did piecework for the merchant artisans. The small market meant there was no steady or well-paid employment; many lived in constant debt.<ref>Barbara McLean Ward, \"Hierarchy and Wealth Distribution in the Boston Goldsmiths Trade, 1690-1760,\" ''Essex Institute Historical Collections'' (1990) 126#3 pp 129\u2013147.</ref>\n\nColonial silver working was pre-industrial in many ways: many pieces made were \"bespoke,\" or uniquely made for each customer, and emphasized artistry as well as functionality. Silver (and other metal) mines were scarcer in North America than in Europe, and colonial craftsmen had no consistent source of materials with which to work.<ref>{{Harv|Tunis|1965|pp=4, 82}}</ref> For each piece of silver they crafted, raw materials had to be collected and often reused from disparate sources, most commonly Spanish coins. The purity of these sources was not regulated, nor was there an organized supply chain through which to obtain silver.<ref>{{Harv|Waters|1977|pp=20}}</ref> As silver objects were sold by weight, manufacturers who could produce silver objects cheaply by mass had an advantage.<ref>{{Harv|Sperry|1988|pp=41\u201363}}</ref> Many of these unique, individual aspects to silver working kept artisan practices in place through the late 18th century.\n\nAs demand for silver increased and large-scale manufacturing techniques emerged, silver products became much more standardized. For special-order objects that would likely only be made once, silversmiths generally used [[lost-wax casting]], in which a sculpted object was carved out of wax, an [[investment casting]] was made, and the wax was melted away. The molds produced in this manner could only be used once, which made them inconvenient for standard objects like handles and buckles. [[Permanent mold casting]], an industrial casting technique focused on high-volume production, allowed smiths to reuse molds to make exact replicas of the most commonly used items they sold. In creating these molds and developing standardized manufacturing processes, silversmiths could begin delegating some work to [[apprentices]] and [[journeymen]]. For instance, after 1780, Paul Revere's sons took on more significant roles in his shop,<ref>{{Harv|Sperry|1988|pp=43}}</ref> and his silver pieces often included wooden handles made by carpenters more experienced with woodwork.<ref name=\"Marcello 2010 128\">{{Harv|Marcello|2010|pp=128}}</ref> For even some of the most successful artisans like Revere,<ref>{{Harv|Bartlett|1984|pp=25}}</ref> artisan was not a profitable enterprise compared to mass-production using iron or bronze casting.<ref name=\"Marcello 2010 128\"/> Creating products that could be replicated for multiple customers, adopting new business practices and labor policies, and new equipment made manufacturing more ultimately efficient. These changes, in tandem with new techniques and requirements defined by changing social standards, led to the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in Colonial America that preceded and anticipated the industrial revolution.\n\nLate in the colonial era a few silversmiths expanded operations with manufacturing techniques and changing business practices They hired assistants, subcontracted out piecework and standardized output.<ref>{{Harv|Marcello|2010|pp=7}}</ref> One individual in the vanguard of America's shift towards more industrial methods was [[Paul Revere]], who emphasized the production of increasingly standardized items later in his career with the use of a silver flatting mill, increased numbers of salaried employees, and other advances.<ref>{{Harv|Marcello|2010|pp=107\u2013114}}</ref> Still, traditional methods of artisan remained, and smiths performed a great deal of work by hand. The coexistence of the craft and industrial production styles prior to the industrial revolution is an example of [[proto-industrialization]].\n\n===Factories and mills===\nIn the mid-1780s, [[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill that included a [[grain elevator]] and [[hopper boy]]. Evans' design eventually displaced the traditional [[gristmill]]s. By the turn of the century, Evans also developed one of the first high-pressure [[steam engine]]s and began establishing a network of machine workshops to manufacture and repair these popular inventions. In 1789, the widow of [[Nathanael Greene]] recruited [[Eli Whitney]] to develop a machine to separate the seeds of short fibered cotton from the fibers. The resulting [[cotton gin]] could be made with basic carpentry skills but reduced the necessary labor by a factor of 50 and generated huge profits for cotton growers in the South.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=77}}</ref> While Whitney did not realize financial success from his invention, he moved on to manufacturing rifles and other armaments under a government contract that could be made with \"expedition, uniformity, and exactness\"\u2014the foundational ideas for [[interchangeable parts]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=80}}</ref> However, Whitney's vision of [[interchangeable parts]] would not be achieved for over two decades with firearms and even longer for other devices.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1820, new industrial tools that rapidly increased the quality and efficiency of manufacturing emerged. [[Simeon North]] suggested using [[division of labor]] to increase the speed with which a complete [[pistol]] could be manufactured which led to the development of a [[milling machine]] in 1798. In 1819, [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]] created a [[lathe]] that could reliably cut irregular shapes, like those needed for arms manufacture. By 1822, [[Captain John H. Hall]] had developed a system using [[machine tool]]s, division of labor, and an unskilled workforce to produce a [[breech-loading rifle]]\u2014a process that came to be known as \"[[Armory practice]]\" in the U.S. and the ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'' in England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=81\u201382}}</ref><ref name=\"hounshell-1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref>\n[[File:Boston Manufacturing Company.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Lowell]]'s [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] revolutionized the role of factories.]]\n\nThe [[textile industry]], which had previously relied upon labor-intensive production methods, was also rife with potential for mechanization. In the late 18th century, the English textile industry had adopted the [[spinning jenny]], [[water frame]], and [[spinning mule]] which greatly improved the efficiency and quality of textile manufacture, but were closely guarded by the British government which forbade their export or the emigration of those who were familiar with the technology. The 1787 [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] was the first [[cotton mill]] in the United States, but it relied on horse power. [[Samuel Slater]], an apprentice in one of the largest textile factories in England, immigrated to the United States in 1789 upon learning that American states were paying bounties to British expatriates with a knowledge of textile machinery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=83}}</ref> With the help of [[Moses Brown (Providence)|Moses Brown of Providence]], Slater established America's oldest currently existing cotton-spinning mill with a fully mechanized water power system at the [[Slater Mill]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] in 1793. \n \nHoping to harness the ample power of the [[Merrimack River]], another group of investors began building the [[Middlesex Canal]] up the Mystic River, both Mystic Lakes and generally following stream valleys (near to today's [[MA 38]]) reached the Merrimack in [[Chelmsford, MA|Chelmsford]] {{convert|35|mi}} from Boston Harbor, establishing limited operations by 1808, and a system of [[navigations]] and canals reaching past [[Manchester, NH|Manchester]] by mid-1814&mdash;and spawning commercial activities, and especially new clothing mills throughout the region. At nearly the same time as the canal was completed, [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] and a consortium of businessmen set up the clothing mills in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] making use of water power from the [[Charles River]] with the concept of housing together production of feedstocks complete consumer processes so raw materials entered, and dyed fabrics or clothing left. For a few decades, it seemed that every [[lock (water transport)|lock]] along the canal had mills and water wheels. In 1821, Boston Manufacturing Company built a major expansion in East Chelmsford, which was soon incorporated as [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]&mdash;which came to dominate the cloth production and clothing industry for decades.\n \nSlater's Mill was established in the [[Blackstone Valley]], which extended into neighboring [[Massachusetts]], ([[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]]'s Woolen Mill, 1809 at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]]), and became one of the earliest industrialized region in the United States, second to the North Shore of Massachusetts. Slater's business model of independent mills and mill villages (the \"[[Rhode Island System]]\") began to be replaced by the 1820s by a more efficient system (the \"[[Waltham System]]\") based upon [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]]'s replications of British [[power looms]]. Slater went on to build several more cotton and wool mills throughout [[New England]], but when faced with a labor shortage, resorted to building housing, shops, and churches for the workers and their families adjacent to his factories. The first [[power looms]] for woolens were installed in 1820, at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], by [[John Capron]], of [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]]. These added automated weaving under the same roof, a step which Slater's system outsourced to local farms. Lowell looms were managed by specialized employees, many of the employed were unmarried young women (\"[[Lowell mill girls]]\"), and owned by a corporation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=87}}</ref> Unlike the previous forms of labor ([[apprenticeship]], family labor, [[slavery]], and [[indenture]]), the Lowell system popularized the concept of [[wage laborer]] who sells his labor to an employer under contract\u2014a socio-economic system which persists in many modern countries and industries. The corporation also looked out for the health and well being of the young women, including their spiritual health, and the hundreds of women employed by it culturally established the pattern of a young woman going off to work for a few years to save money before returning home to school and marriage. It created an independent breed of women uncommon in most of the world.\n\n===Turnpikes and canals===\n{{main|History of turnpikes and canals in the United States}}\n[[File:Erie Canal, Lock 32.jpg|thumb|left|195px|A lock on the Erie Canal.]]\n[[File:Canals USA 1825.png|thumb|USA canals circa 1825]]\n[[File:Highways USA 1825.png|thumb|Highways in the USA circa 1825]]\n\nEven as the country grew even larger with the admission of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Ohio]] by 1803, the only means of transportation between these landlocked western states and their coastal neighbors was by foot, pack animal, or ship. Recognizing the success of [[Roman road]]s in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=94}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[toll road]]s were constructed and owned by [[joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] that sold stock to raise construction capital like [[Pennsylvania]]'s 1795 [[Lancaster Turnpike|Lancaster Turnpike Company]]. In 1808, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Albert Gallatin]]'s ''Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals'' suggested that the federal government should fund the construction of interstate [[Toll road|turnpikes]] and [[canal]]s. While many [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Anti-Federalists]] opposed the federal government assuming such a role, the British blockade in the War of 1812 demonstrated the United States' reliance upon these overland roads for military operations as well as for general commerce.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=98}}</ref> Construction on the [[National Road]] began in 1815 in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] and reached [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]] in 1818, but political strife thereafter ultimately prevented its western advance to the [[Mississippi River]]. Nevertheless, the road became a primary overland conduit through [[Appalachian Mountains]] and was the gateway for thousands of antebellum westward-bound settlers.\n\nNumerous canal companies had also been chartered; but of all the canals projected, only three had been completed when the War of 1812 began: the [[Dismal Swamp Canal]] in Virginia, the [[Santee Canal]] in South Carolina, and the [[Middlesex Canal]] in Massachusetts. It remained for New York to usher in a new era in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 the construction of the [[Erie Canal]]. This bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia, particularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert much of their traffic to Baltimore. In 1825, the legislature of Pennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals which were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburgh on the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north.<ref>{{Citation |last=Johnson |first=Allen |authorlink=Allen Johnson (historian) |title=Union and Democracy |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1915 |pages=255\u2013256 }}</ref> The [[Blackstone Canal]], (1823\u20131828) in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], and the [[Morris Canal]] across northern [[New Jersey]] (1824\u20131924) soon followed, along with the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] from [[Chicago]] to the [[Illinois River]](1824\u20131848).\n\nLike the turnpikes, the early canals were constructed, owned, and operated by private joint-stock companies but later gave way to larger projects funded by the states. The [[Erie Canal]], proposed by [[Governor of New York]] [[De Witt Clinton]], was the first canal project undertaken as a public good to be financed at the public risk through the issuance of [[Municipal bond|bonds]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=102}}</ref> When the project was completed in 1825, the canal linked [[Lake Erie]] with the [[Hudson River]] through 83 separate locks and over a distance of {{convert|363|mi|km|0}}. The success of the Erie Canal spawned a boom of other canal-building around the country: over {{convert|3326|mi|km}} of artificial waterways were constructed between 1816 and 1840.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=104\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=104}}</ref> Small towns like [[Syracuse, New York]], [[Buffalo, New York]], and [[Cleveland, Ohio]] that lay along major canal routes boomed into major industrial and trade centers, while canal-building pushed some states like [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Indiana]] to the brink of [[bankruptcy]].<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=104\"/>\n\nThe magnitude of the transportation problem was such, however, that neither individual states nor private corporations seemed able to meet the demands of an expanding internal trade. As early as 1807, [[Albert Gallatin]] had advocated the construction of a great system of internal waterways to connect East and West, at an estimated cost of $20,000,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000000|1807|r=0}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} consumer dollars). But the only contribution of the national government to [[internal improvements]] during the Jeffersonian era was an appropriation in 1806 of two percent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands in Ohio for the construction of a national road, with the consent of the states through which it should pass. By 1818 the road was open to traffic from [[Cumberland, Maryland]], to Wheeling, West Virginia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=256}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, with the experiences of the war before him, no well-informed statesman could shut his eyes to the national aspects of the problem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even President Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing \"a comprehensive system of roads and canals\". Soon after Congress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by Calhoun which proposed an appropriation of $1,500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1816|r=0}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} consumer dollars) for internal improvements. Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government, the bill was commonly referred to as the \"Bonus Bill\". But on the day before he left office, President Madison vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional. The policy of internal improvements by federal aid was thus wrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia dynasty. Having less regard for consistency, the House of Representatives recorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals, but had not the power to construct them. As yet the only direct aid of the national government to internal improvements consisted of various appropriations, amounting to about $1,500,000 for the [[Cumberland Road]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=257\u2013258}}</ref>\n\nAs the country recovered from financial depression following the [[Panic of 1819]], the question of internal improvements again forged to the front. In 1822, a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed by the President. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation of the national government in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than [[Henry Clay]]. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Of the other presidential candidates, Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=309\u2013310}}</ref>\n\nIn President Adams' first message to Congress, he advocated not only the construction of roads and canals but also the establishment of [[observatory|observatories]] and a national university. President Jefferson had recommended many of these in 1806 for Congress to consider for creation of necessary amendments to the Constitution. Adams seemed oblivious to the limitations of the Constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In much alarm, Jefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt a new set of resolutions, bottomed on those of 1798, and directed against the acts for internal improvements. In March 1826, the general assembly declared that all the principles of the earlier resolutions applied \"with full force against the powers assumed by Congress\" in passing acts to protect manufacturers and to further internal improvements. That the administration would meet with opposition in Congress was a foregone conclusion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\n===Steamboats===\n[[File:Clermont illustration - Robert Fulton - Project Gutenberg eText 15161.jpg|thumb|200px|Fulton's ''North River Steamboat'' on the Hudson.]]\nDespite the new efficiencies introduced by the turnpikes and canals, travel along these routes was still time-consuming and expensive. The idea of integrating a steam [[boiler]] and propulsion system can be first attributed to [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] and [[James Rumsey]] who both filed for patents or state monopolies on [[steamboat]]s in the late 1780s. However, these first steamboats were complicated, heavy, and expensive. It would be almost 20 years until [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]] contracted a civil [[engineering|engineer]] named [[Robert Fulton]] to develop an economical steamboat. Fulton's [[paddle steamer]], ''The North River Steamboat'' (erroneously referred to as the ''Clermont''), made its first trip from New York City north on the Hudson River to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on August 17, 1807. By 1820, steamboat services had been established on all the Atlantic [[river|tidal rivers]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The shallow-bottomed boats were also ideally suited navigating the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River]]s and the number of boats on these rivers increased from 17 boats to 727 boats between 1817 and 1855.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=108}}</ref> The speed of the steamboats decreased travel times between coastal ports and upstream cities by weeks and costs for transporting goods along these rivers by as much as 90%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=110}}</ref>\n\nSteamboats profoundly altered the relationships between the federal government, state governments, and private property owners. Livingston and Fulton had obtained monopoly rights to operate a steamboat service within the state of New York, but Thomas Gibbons, who operated a competing New Jersey ferry service, was [[enjoin]]ed from entering New York waters under the terms of the monopoly. In 1824, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' that Congress could regulate commerce and transportation under the [[Commerce Clause]] which compelled the state of New York to allow steamboat services from other states.\n\nBecause the [[Structural failure|physics]] and [[Wrought iron#Properties|metallurgy]] of boilers were poorly understood, steamboats were prone to [[boiler explosion]]s that killed hundreds of people between the 1810s and 1840s.<ref>{{Citation |last=Burke |first=John G. |chapter=Bursting Boilers and the Federal Power |editor=S.

The earliest proposal came in 1813 from Oliver Evans' idea of a railway to connect New York and Philadelphia with \"carriages drawn by steam engines.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=113}}</ref> Many individuals and companies have a claim to being the [[first railroad in the United States]], but by the mid-1830s several companies were using steam-powered [[locomotive]]s to move [[train car]]s on [[rail tracks]].

However, the early railroads were poorly integrated; there were hundreds of competing companies using different [[Rail gauge|gauges]] for their track requiring cargo to be [[transshipment|trans-shipped]]\u2014rather than traveling directly\u2014between cities.\n\nThe completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869 and its attendant profit and efficiency had the effect of stimulating a period of intense consolidation and technological standardization that would last another 50 years. It was during this time that railroad [[magnates]] such as [[Jay Gould]] and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] amassed great power and fortunes from consolidation of smaller rail lines into national corporations. By 1920, {{convert|254000|mi|km|-2}} of standard-gauge railroad track had been laid in the United States, all of it owned or controlled by seven organizations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=154}}</ref> The need to synchronize train schedules and the inefficiencies introduced by every city having its own local time, also led to introduction of [[Standard time]] by railway managers in 1883.

By the end of the 18th century, the threat of [[deforestation]] forced the English to use [[coke (fuel)|coke]], a fuel derived from [[coal]], to fire their furnaces.

The [[Kelly-Bessemer process]], because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.\n\nIn 1868, [[Andrew Carnegie]] saw an opportunity to integrate new coke-making methods with the recently developed Kelly-Bessemer process to supply steel for railroads. In 1872, he built a steel plant in [[Braddock, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Braddock, Pennsylvania]] at the junction of several major railroad lines. Carnegie earned enormous profits by pioneering [[vertical integration]]; he owned the iron ore mines in [[Minnesota]], the transport steamboats on the [[Great Lakes]], the coal mines and coke ovens, and the rail lines delivering the coke and ore to his Pennsylvania mills. By 1900, the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] was producing more steel than all of Britain and in 1901 Carnegie sold his business to [[J.P.

Morse established the first [[telegraph]] line (between [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Washington D.C.]]) in 1844 and by 1849 almost every state east of the Mississippi had telegraph service.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=152\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=152}}</ref> Between 1850 and 1865, the telegraph business became progressively more consolidated and the 1866 incorporation of [[Western Union]] emerged with a near-monopoly over 22,000 telegraph offices and {{convert|827000|mi|km|-2}} of cable throughout the country.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=152\" /> The telegraph was used to dispatch news from the fronts of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], coordinate [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troop movements during the Civil War, relay [[stock]] and [[commodity]] prices and orders between markets on [[ticker tape]], and conduct [[diplomacy|diplomatic negotiations]] after the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid in 1866.\n\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] obtained a patent in 1876 to a device that could transmit and reproduce the sound of a voice over electrical cables.

Because crude oil needs to be [[distilled]] to extract usable [[fuel oil]]s, [[oil refining]] quickly became a major industry in the area. However, the rural and mountainous terrain of these Pennsylvania oilfields allowed neither economical [[in-situ]] refining nor efficient railroad transportation of extracted oil. Beginning in 1865, the construction of [[oil pipeline]]s to connect the oilfields with railroads or oil refineries alleviated this geographical bottleneck but also put thousands of [[cooper (profession)|coopers]] and [[teamster]]s (who made the barrels and drove the wagons to transport oil) out of business.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=158}}</ref> As the network of oil pipelines expanded, they became more integrated with both the railway and telegraph systems which enabled even greater coordination in production, scheduling, and pricing.\n\n[[John D.

By 1879, he controlled 90% of oil refined in the US.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\" /> Standard Oil used pipelines to directly connect the Pennsylvanian oilfields with the refineries in New Jersey, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, rather than loading and unloading railroad tank cars, which enabled huge gains in efficiency and profitability. Given the unprecedented scale of Standard Oil's network, the company developed novel methods for managing, financing, and organizing its businesses. Because laws governing corporations limited their ability to do business across state lines, Standard Oil pioneered the use of a central [[Trust company|trust]] that owned and controlled the constituent companies in each state.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\" /> The use of trusts by other industries to stifle competition and extract [[monopoly]] prices led to the 1890 passage of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. In the 1911 case of ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]'', the Supreme Court ordered the Standard Oil Trust be disbanded into competing companies that would become [[Exxon]] (Standard Oil of New Jersey), [[Mobil]] (Standard Oil of New York), and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] (Standard Oil of California).\n\nThe demand for petroleum products increased rapidly after the turn of the century as families relied upon [[kerosene]] to heat and light their houses, industries relied upon [[lubricant]]s for machinery, and the ever-more prevalent [[internal combustion engine]] demanded [[gasoline]] fuel. Between 1880 and 1920, the amount of oil refined annually jumped from {{convert|26000000|oilbbl}} to 442 million.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\" /> The discovery of large oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and California in the early 20th century touched off \"oil crazes\" and contributed to these states' rapid industrialization. Because these previously agrarian western states lay outside of the various Standard Oil's production and refining networks, cities like [[Long Beach, California]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Houston, Texas]] emerged as major centers for refining and managing these new fields under companies like [[Sunoco]], [[Texaco]], and [[Gulf Oil]].\n\n===Electricity===\n{{Main|Electrification}}\n{{See also|History of electromagnetism|War of currents}}\n[[File:Transmission Towers.jpg|200px|thumb|Electrification revolutionized American industry and commerce.]]\n\n[[Benjamin Franklin]] pioneered the study of electricity by being the first to describe positive and negative charges,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/FranklinBenjamin.html |title=Benjamin Franklin (1706\u20131790) |author=Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> as well as advancing the principle of conservation of charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/gap/Franklin/Franklin.html |title=Benjamin Franklin 1706-1790 |author=American Institute of Physics |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> Franklin is best known for the apocryphal feat of flying a kite in thunderstorm to prove that [[lightning]] is a form of [[electricity]] which, in turn, led to the invention of the [[lightning rod]] to protect buildings.\n\nElectricity would remain a novelty through the early to mid 19th century but advances in battery storage, generating, and lighting would turn it into a domestic business. By the late 1870s and early 1880 central generating plants supplying power to [[arc lamp]]s, first in Europe and then in the US, began spreading rapidly, replacing oil and gas for outdoor lighting, systems that ran on very high voltage (3,000\u20136,000 volt) [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]]. In 1880, [[Thomas Edison]] developed and patented a system for indoor lighting that competed with gas lighting, based on a long-lasting high resistance [[incandescent light bulb]] that ran on relatively low voltage (110 volt) direct current. Commercializing this venture was a task far beyond what Edison's small laboratory could handle, requiring the setup of a large investor backed [[utility]] that involving companies that would manufacture the whole technological system upon which the \"light bulb\" would depend\u2014generators (Edison Machine Company), cables (Edison Electric Tube Company), generating plants and electric service (Edison Electric Light Company), sockets, and bulbs.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=163\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=163}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to lighting, [[electric motor]]s (analogous to generators operating in reverse, or using a current to spin a magnet to perform work) became extremely important to industry. Speed control of early DC motors limited their use. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor (ca. 1886) by solving the problem of varying speed with load. Within a few years DC motors were used in electric street railways.<ref name=\"Nye 1990\">{{cite book |title=Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E. |year=1990 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England}}</ref> In 1888, a [[Serbia]]n immigrant, [[Nikola Tesla]], a former employee of Edison's, patented an AC [[induction motor]] and licensed it to the [[Westinghouse Corporation]]. Electric motors eventually replaced steam engines in factories around the nation as they required neither complex mechanical transmissions from a central engine nor water sources for steam boilers in order to operate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=164}}</ref>\n\nEdison's [[direct current]] generation dominated the initial years of indoor commercial and residential electric lighting and [[electric power distribution]]. However, DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing [[voltages]] between industrial generation and residential/commercial consumption and the low voltages used suffered from poor transmission efficiency. The mid 1880s saw the introduction of the [[transformer]], allowing [[alternating current]] to be transmitted at high voltage long distances with greater efficiency and then \"stepped down\" to supply commercial and domestic indoor lighting, resulting in AC going from being the outdoor \"arc lighting current\" to taking over the domestic lighting utility market Edison's DC system was designed to supply. The rapid spread of AC and haphazard installation of power lines, especially in the city of New York, led to a series of deaths attributed to high voltage AC and an eventual media backlash against the current.<ref>Jill Jonnes, ''Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World'', Random House, 2004, page 143</ref><ref>Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'', Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2010, page 280</ref> Starting in 1888 the Edison company played up the dangers of AC power in their literature and assisted self-appointed anti-AC crusader [[Harold P. Brown]] in a parallel goal to limit, to the point of ineffectiveness, the voltages in AC power systems, a market then dominated by [[Westinghouse Electric]]. This series of events came to be known as the [[war of the currents]]. Brown and Edison's [[lobbying]] in state legislatures went nowhere and the Edison company continued to lose market share and profitability to the AC based companies. In 1892 the \"war\" ended with Thomas Edison losing any remaining control of his own company when it was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], to form [[General Electric]], creating a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.<ref name=\"Mark Essig 2009, page 268\">Mark Essig, ''Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death'', Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009, page 268</ref><ref>Robert L.

Lighting was immensely popular: between 1882 and 1920 the number of generating plants in the US increased from one in downtown Manhattan to nearly 4,000.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=163\" /> While the earliest generating plants were constructed in the immediate vicinity of consumers, plants generating electricity for long-distance transmissions were in place by 1900. To help finance this great expansion, the utility industry exploited a financial innovation known as the \"[[holding company]]\"; a favorite holding company investment among many was the [[Electric Bond and Share Company]] (later much-changed, and known as Ebasco), created by the General Electric company in 1905. The abuse of holding companies, like trusts before it, led to the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/past/h1main.htm|title=Powering A Generation: Power History #2|publisher=}}</ref> but by 1920, electricity had surpassed petroleum-based lighting sources that had dominated the previous century.\n\n===Automobiles===\n{{see also|History of the automobile|Interstate Highway System}}\n[[File:AssemblyLine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Model T]] revolutionized transportation in the 1900s as well as increased production by use of the [[assembly line]]. Shown is a test of mounting the body on the chassis, which was actually done inside the factory by using an [[overhead crane]].]]\nThe technology for creating an [[automobile]] emerged in Germany in the 1870 and 1880s: [[Nicolaus Otto]] created a [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[internal combustion engine]], [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] modified the Otto engine to run at higher speeds, and [[Karl Benz]] pioneered the [[electric ignition]]. The [[Duryea brothers]] and [[Hiram Percy Maxim]] were among the first to construct a \"horseless carriage\" in the US in the mid-1890s, but these early cars proved to be heavy and expensive.\n\n[[Henry Ford]] revolutionized the automobile manufacturing process by employing [[interchangeable parts]] on [[assembly lines]]\u2014the beginning of industrial [[mass production]]. In 1908, the [[Ford Motor Company]] released the [[Ford Model T]] which could generate 20 [[horsepower]], was lightweight, and easy to repair. Demand for the car was so great, he had to relocate his assembly plant to [[Highland Park, Michigan]] in 1912. The new plant was a model of industrial efficiency for the time: it was well lit and ventilated, employed [[conveyor]]s to move parts along an assembly line, and workers' stations were orderly arranged along the line. The efficiency of the assembly line allowed Ford to realize great gains in economy and productivity; in 1912, Ford sold 6,000 cars for approximately $900 and by 1916 approximately 577,000 Model T automobiles were sold for $360.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=229}}</ref> Ford was able to scale production rapidly because assembly-line workers were unskilled laborers performing repetitive tasks. Ford hired European immigrants, African-Americans, ex-convicts, and the disabled and paid comparatively high wages, but was quick to dismiss anyone involved in [[labor union]]s or [[Anarchism in the United States|radical]] [[Socialism in the United States|political]] [[Communist Party USA|associations]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=230}}</ref>\n\n[[File:La city hwys.jpg|230px|left|thumb|[[California]], like much of the United States, is dependent on the [[Interstate Highway System]], which, with larger junctions like this [[stack interchange]], is quite complicated and expensive.]]\n\nWith growth of American automobile usage, urban and rural roads were gradually upgraded for the new traffic. Local automobile clubs formed the [[American Automobile Association]] to [[Lobbying|lobby]] city, state, and federal governments to widen and pave existing roads and build limited-access [[highway]]s. Some federal road aid was passed in the 1910s and 20s (resulting in highways like [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[U.S. Route 66]]). The coverage and quality of many roads would greatly improve following Depression-era [[Works Progress Administration]] investment in road infrastructure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=236}}</ref> New Automobile sales were temporarily slowed during World War II when wartime [[rationing]] and military production lines limited the number of automobiles that could be manufactured\u2014the largest companies like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors|GM]], and [[Chrysler]] would survive those lean years. After the war, [[Baby boom|rising family sizes]], increasing affluence, and government-subsidized mortgages for veterans fueled a boom in single-family homes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=237}}</ref> Many were automobile-owners. In 1956, Congress passed the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] which provided funding for the construction of {{convert|41000|mi|km|-2}} of toll-free expressways throughout the country laying the legislative and infrastructural foundations for the modern American highway system.\n\n==Effects of industrialization==\n===Agricultural production===\n{{Main|Agricultural history of the United States}}\n[[File:GLEANER L2.JPG|thumb|200px|([[Gleaner Manufacturing Company|Gleaner]]) Mechanical [[combine harvester]].]]\nIn the 1840s, as more and more western states joined the Union, many poor and middle-class Americans increasingly agitated for free land in these large, undeveloped areas. Early efforts to pass a Homestead Act by [[George Henry Evans]] and [[Horace Greeley]] were stymied by Southern states who feared that free land would threaten the plantation system. The [[Homestead Act]] was passed in 1862 after the opposing Southern states had [[secede]]d. The Homestead Act granted 160 acres (65 hectares) to farmers who lived on the land for 5 years or allowed the farmer to purchase the land after 6 months for $1.25 per acre ($3/ha).\n\nEven as America's westward expansion allowed over 400 million acres (1,600,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of new land to be put under cultivation, between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=166\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=166}}</ref> New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes. [[Cyrus McCormick]]'s reaper (invented in 1834) allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device. [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] invented the [[steel]] plow in 1837, keeping the soil from sticking to the plow and making it easier to farm in the rich [[prairie]]s of the [[Midwest]]. The harvester, self-binder, and combine allowed even greater efficiencies: wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an average yield of 9.9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15.3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=170}}</ref>\n\nRailroads allowed harvests to reach markets more quickly and [[Gustavus Franklin Swift]]'s refrigerated railroad car allowed fresh meat and fish to reach distant markets. Food distribution also became more mechanized as companies like Heinz and Campbell distributed previously perishable foods by canning and evaporation. Commercial bakeries, breweries, and meatpackers replaced locally owned operators and drove demand for raw agricultural goods. Despite increasing demand, rising production caused a drop in prices, creating substantial discontent among farmers. Organizations like [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|The Grange]] and [[Farmers Alliance]] emerged to demand [[Free silver|monetary policy that allowed for money supply expansion]] (as most farmers carried significant debt from planting time to harvest time), railroad regulations, and protective tariffs.\n\n===Urbanization===\nThe period between 1865 and 1920 was marked by the increasing concentration of people, political power, and economic activity in urban areas. In 1860, there were nine cities with populations over 100,000 and by 1910 there were fifty.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=166\" /> These new large cities were not coastal port cities (like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia) but laid inland along new transportation routes (like Denver, Chicago, and Cleveland). The [[List of Presidents of the United States|first twelve presidents of the United States]] had all been born into farming communities, but between 1865 and 1912 the Presidency was filled by men with backgrounds of representing businesses and cities.\n\nIndustrialization and urbanization reinforced each other and urban areas became increasingly congested. As a result of unsanitary living conditions, diseases like [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhoid fever]] struck urban areas with increasing frequency. Cities responded by paving streets, digging sewers, sanitizing water, constructing housing, and creating public transportation systems.\n\n===Labor issues and immigration===\n{{see also|Labor unions in the United States|Immigration to the United States}}\nAs the nation deepened its technological base, old-fashioned artisans and craftsmen became \"[[deskilling|deskilled]]\" and replaced by specialized workers and engineers who used machines to replicate in minutes or hours work that would require a journeyman hours or days to complete. [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick W. Taylor]], recognizing the inefficiencies introduced by some production lines, proposed that by studying the motions and processes necessary to manufacture each component of a product, reorganizing the factory and manufacturing processes around workers, and paying workers piece rates would allow great gains in process efficiency. Scientific management, or \"Taylorism\" as it came to be known, was soon being applied by progressive city governments to make their urban areas more efficient and by suffragettes to home economics.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=212}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing industrialization outpaced the supply of laborers able or willing to work in dangerous, low-paying, and dead-end jobs. However, the demand for low or unskilled jobs drove wages up and attracted waves of Irish, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Jewish immigrants who could earn more in America than in their homelands.\n\nThe earliest unions emerged before the Civil War as trade guilds composed of journeyman carpenters, masons, and other artisans who would engage in strikes to demand better hours and pay from their masters. All branches of government generally sought to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes.\n\n===Banking, trading, and financial services===\n{{see also|History of banking}}\n[[File:NYSE-floor.jpg|200px|thumb|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].]]\n\nTo finance the larger-scale enterprises required during this era, the Stockholder Corporation emerged as the dominant form of business organization. Corporations expanded by combining into trusts, and by creating single firms out of competing firms, known as monopolies.\nBanking, investment, insurance, consulting, corporations, speculation, business cycle\n\n===Regulation===\nThe [[Progressive movement]] and the [[Progressive Era]] that emerged from it was in part a reaction to excesses of the new industrial age. \"[[Muckraker|Muckraking]]\" journalists reported on a wide array of social issues, and the reaction of the public lent urgency to reforms that led to increased government regulation, such as the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]] (pertaining to railroads), and the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] (1906).\n\n[[File:HooverDamConstruction.jpg|thumb|200px|The Hoover Dam on the Arizona-California border was one of many large-scale water-power projects]]\n\n==Military-industrial-academic complex==\n{{see also|Military-industrial complex}}\nIn the 20th century, the pace of technological developments increasingly became tied into a complex set of interactions between [[United State Congress|Congress]], the industrial manufacturers, university research, and the [[United States military|military establishment]]. This set of relations, known more popularly as the \"military-industrial complex,\" emerged because the military's unique technological demands, concentration of funding, large-scale application, and highly centralized control played a dominant role in driving technological innovation. Fundamental advances in [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[computing]], [[aviation]], [[material science]], [[naval architecture]], and [[meteorology]], among other fields, can be traced back to basic and applied research for military applications.

The [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], established in 1811, broke the mold of traditional universities and military academies alike by including practical engineering-related subjects in its earliest curricula. By the middle of the 19th century, polytechnic institutes were being founded in increasing numbers to train students in the scientific and technical skills needed to design, build, and operate increasingly complex machines. In 1824, [[Stephen van Rensselaer]] established the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|first American institute]] granting a bachelor's degree in technical subjects and in the 1850s several [[Ivy League]] schools began to offer courses of study in scientific fields.\n\nCongressional legislators, recognizing the increasing importance and prevalence of these eastern polytechnic schools, passed the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] providing large grants of land<ref>30,000 acres (120 km\u00b2) of federal land, either within or contiguous to its boundaries, for each member of Congress the state had as of the census of 1860 - a minimum of 90,000 acres (360 km\u00b2). {{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/27.htm |title=Backgrounder on the Morrill Act |publisher=International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State |accessdate=2007-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411041720/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/27.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> that were to be used toward establishing and funding the educational institutions that would teach courses on military tactics, engineering, and agriculture.

The availability of land and literate labor, the absence of a landed aristocracy, the prestige of entrepreneurship, the diversity of climate and a large easily accessed upscale and literate free market all contributed to America's rapid [[industrialization]]. The availability of capital, development by the free market of navigable rivers, and coastal waterways, and the abundance of natural resources facilitated the cheap extraction of energy all contributed to America's rapid industrialization. Fast transport by the very large railroad built in the mid-19th century, and the [[Interstate Highway System]] built in the late 20th century, enlarged the markets and reduced shipping and production costs. The legal system facilitated business operations and guaranteed contracts. Cut off from Europe by the embargo and the British blockade in the [[War of 1812]] (1807\u201315), entrepreneurs opened factories in the Northeast that set the stage for rapid industrialization modeled on British innovations.\n\nFrom its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has encouraged science and innovation. As a result, the United States has been the birthplace of 161 of Britannica's 321 Greatest Inventions, including items such as the airplane, internet, [[microchip]], laser, [[cellphone]], refrigerator, email, microwave, [[personal computer]], [[Liquid-crystal display]] and [[light-emitting diode]] technology, air conditioning, [[assembly line]], supermarket, [[bar code]], [[automated teller machine]], and many more.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica [https://web.archive.org/web/20060513185450/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html \"Greatest Inventions\"], ''Britannica Corporate'', Published 5/13/2006. Retrieved 7/10/2017.</ref>\n\nThe early technological and industrial development in the United States was facilitated by a unique confluence of geographical, social, and economic factors. The relative lack of workers kept the United States wages nearly always higher than corresponding British and European workers and provided an incentive to mechanize some tasks. The United States population had some semi-unique advantages in that they were former British subjects, had high English literacy skills, for that period (over 80% in New England), had strong British institutions, with some minor American modifications, of courts, laws, right to vote, protection of property rights and in many cases personal contacts among the British innovators of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. They had a good basic structure to build on. Another major advantage, which the British lacked, was no inherited aristocratic institutions. The eastern seaboard of the United States, with a great number of rivers and streams along the Atlantic seaboard, provided many potential sites for constructing textile mills necessary for early industrialization. The technology and information on how to build a textile industry were largely provided by [[Samuel Slater]] (1768\u20131835) who emigrated to New England in 1789. He had studied and worked in British textile mills for a number of years and immigrated to the United States, despite restrictions against it, to try his luck with U.S. manufacturers who were trying to set up a textile industry. He was offered a full partnership if he could succeed\u2014he did. A vast supply of natural resources, the technological knowledge on how to build and power the necessary machines along with a labor supply of mobile workers, often unmarried females, all aided early industrialization. The broad knowledge carried by European migrants of two periods that advanced the societies there, namely the European Industrial Revolution and European [[Scientific revolution]], helped facilitate understanding for the construction and invention of new manufacturing businesses and technologies. A limited government that would allow them to succeed or fail on their own merit helped.\n\nAfter the close of the American Revolution in 1783, the new government continued the strong property rights established under British rule and established a rule of law necessary to protect those property rights. The idea of issuing [[patents]] was incorporated into Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizing Congress \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" The invention of the [[Cotton Gin]] by American [[Eli Whitney]] made cotton potentially a cheap and readily available resource in the United States for use in the new textile industry.\n\nOne of the real impetuses for the United States entering the Industrial Revolution was the passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], the [[War of 1812]] (1812\u201314) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u201315) which cut off supplies of new and cheaper Industrial revolution products from Britain. The lack of access to these goods all provided a strong incentive to learn how to develop the industries and to make their own goods instead of simply buying the goods produced by Britain.\n\nModern productivity researchers have shown that the period in which the greatest economic and technological progress occurred was between the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kendrick |first1=John |title=U.S. Productivity Performance in Perspective, Business Economics, October 1, 1991 |year=1991 |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/finance/262030-1.html |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"Field 2004\">{{cite web |last1=Field |first1=Alexander |title=Technological Change and Economic Growth the Interwar Years and the 1990s |year=2004 |url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/echist/eh04/field-041006.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310163302/http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/echist/eh04/field-041006.pdf |archivedate=March 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Field |first1=Alezander J.|title=U.S. Economic Growth in the Gilded Age, Journal of Macroeconomics 31 |year=2007|pages=173\u2013190 |ref=harv}}</ref> During this period the nation was transformed from an agricultural economy to the foremost industrial power in the world, with more than a third of the global industrial output. This can be illustrated by the index of total industrial production, which increased from 4.29 in 1790 to 1,975.00 in 1913, an increase of 460 times (base year 1850 \u2013 100).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/data/industrial-production-index/ip-total.html |title=Industrial Production Index |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>\n\nAmerican colonies [[American Revolution|gained independence]] in 1783 just as profound changes in industrial production and coordination were beginning to [[First Industrial Revolution|shift production]] from artisans to factories. Growth of the nation's transportation infrastructure with [[internal improvements]] and a confluence of technological innovations before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] facilitated an expansion in organization, coordination, and [[Second Industrial Revolution|scale of industrial production]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, American industry had superseded its European counterparts economically and the nation began to assert its [[Military history of the United States|military power]]. Although the [[Great Depression]] challenged its [[technological momentum]], America emerged from it and [[World War II]] as one of two global [[superpower]]s. In the second half of the 20th century, as the United States was drawn into competition with the [[Soviet Union]] for [[Cold War|political, economic, and military primacy]], the government invested heavily in scientific research and technological development which spawned advances in [[spaceflight]], [[computing]], and [[biotechnology]].\n\nScience, technology, and industry have not only profoundly shaped America's economic success, but have also contributed to its distinct political institutions, social structure, educational system, and cultural identity.\n\n==Pre-European technology==\n{{see also|Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[File:Monks Mound in July.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Monk's Mound is a large structure built by the indigenous peoples in the Plains.]]\nNorth America has been inhabited continuously since approximately 4,000 BC. The earliest inhabitants were [[nomad]]ic, big-game [[hunter-gatherer]]s who crossed the [[Bering land bridge]]. These first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] relied upon chipped-stone [[spear]]heads, rudimentary [[harpoon]]s, and boats clad in animal hides for hunting in the [[Arctic]]. As they dispersed within the continent, they encountered the varied temperate climates in the Pacific northwest, central plains, Appalachian woodlands, and arid Southwest, where they began to make permanent settlements. The peoples living in the Pacific northwest built wooden houses, used [[net (device)|nets]] and [[Fishing weir|weirs]] to catch fish, and practiced [[food preservation]] to ensure longevity of their food sources, since substantial agriculture was not developed.<ref>{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |pages=7\u20138 |isbn=0-19-504606-4}}</ref> Peoples living on the plains remained largely nomadic (some practiced agriculture for parts of the year) and became adept [[leather|leather workers]] as they hunted [[American bison|buffalo]] while people living in the arid southwest built [[adobe]] buildings, fired [[pottery]], domesticated [[cotton]], and [[loom|wove cloth]]. Tribes in the eastern woodlands and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian Valley]] developed extensive trade networks, built [[Mound builder (people)|pyramid-like mounds]], and practiced substantial agriculture while the peoples living in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and coastal Atlantic practiced highly sustainable forest agriculture and were expert woodworkers. However, the populations of these peoples were small and their rate of technological change was very low.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=10}}</ref> Indigenous peoples did not [[domestication|domesticate]] animals for [[draft animal|drafting]] or [[husbandry]], develop writing systems, or create [[bronze]] or [[iron]]-based tools like their European/Asian counterparts.\n\n==Colonial era==\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agricultural history of the United States}}\nIn the 17th century, [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], [[Puritans]], and [[Quakers]] fleeing religious persecution in Europe brought with them [[plowshare]]s, [[gun]]s, and domesticated animals like [[cow]]s and [[pig]]s. These immigrants and other European colonists initially farmed subsistence crops like [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]], and [[oats]] as well as rendering [[potash]] and [[maple syrup]] for trade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=30}}</ref> Due to the more temperate climate, large-scale [[plantations in the American South]] grew labor-intensive cash crops like [[sugarcane]], [[rice]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]] requiring native and imported African slave labor to maintain. Early American farmers were not self-sufficient; they relied upon other farmers, specialized craftsmen, and merchants to provide tools, process their harvests, and bring them to market.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=40\u201343}}</ref>\n\n===Artisanship===\nColonial artisanship emerged slowly as the market for advanced craftsmanship was small. American artisans developed a more relaxed (less regulated) version of the Old World apprenticeship system for educating and employing the next generation. Despite the fact that [[mercantilist]], export-heavy economy impaired the emergence of a robust self-sustaining economy, craftsmen and merchants developed a growing interdependence on each other for their trades.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=63\u201365}}</ref> In the mid-18th century, attempts by the British to subdue or control the colonies by means of taxation sowed increased discontent among these artisans, who increasingly joined the Patriot cause.\n\n===Silver working===\nColonial Virginia provided a potential market of rich plantations. At least 19 silversmiths worked in Williamsburg between 1699 and 1775. The best-known were James Eddy (1731\u20131809) and his brother-in-law William Wadill, also an engraver. Most planters, however, purchased English-made silver.<ref>Harold Gill, \"Colonial Silver and Silversmiths,\" ''Virginia Cavalcade'' (1970) 18#3 pp 5\u201313.</ref>\n\nIn Boston, goldsmiths and silversmiths were stratified. The most prosperous were merchant-artisans, with a business outlook and high status. Most craftsmen were laboring artisans who either operated small shops or, more often, did piecework for the merchant artisans. The small market meant there was no steady or well-paid employment; many lived in constant debt.<ref>Barbara McLean Ward, \"Hierarchy and Wealth Distribution in the Boston Goldsmiths Trade, 1690-1760,\" ''Essex Institute Historical Collections'' (1990) 126#3 pp 129\u2013147.</ref>\n\nColonial silver working was pre-industrial in many ways: many pieces made were \"bespoke,\" or uniquely made for each customer, and emphasized artistry as well as functionality. Silver (and other metal) mines were scarcer in North America than in Europe, and colonial craftsmen had no consistent source of materials with which to work.<ref>{{Harv|Tunis|1965|pp=4, 82}}</ref> For each piece of silver they crafted, raw materials had to be collected and often reused from disparate sources, most commonly Spanish coins. The purity of these sources was not regulated, nor was there an organized supply chain through which to obtain silver.<ref>{{Harv|Waters|1977|pp=20}}</ref> As silver objects were sold by weight, manufacturers who could produce silver objects cheaply by mass had an advantage.<ref>{{Harv|Sperry|1988|pp=41\u201363}}</ref> Many of these unique, individual aspects to silver working kept artisan practices in place through the late 18th century.\n\nAs demand for silver increased and large-scale manufacturing techniques emerged, silver products became much more standardized. For special-order objects that would likely only be made once, silversmiths generally used [[lost-wax casting]], in which a sculpted object was carved out of wax, an [[investment casting]] was made, and the wax was melted away. The molds produced in this manner could only be used once, which made them inconvenient for standard objects like handles and buckles. [[Permanent mold casting]], an industrial casting technique focused on high-volume production, allowed smiths to reuse molds to make exact replicas of the most commonly used items they sold. In creating these molds and developing standardized manufacturing processes, silversmiths could begin delegating some work to [[apprentices]] and [[journeymen]]. For instance, after 1780, Paul Revere's sons took on more significant roles in his shop,<ref>{{Harv|Sperry|1988|pp=43}}</ref> and his silver pieces often included wooden handles made by carpenters more experienced with woodwork.<ref name=\"Marcello 2010 128\">{{Harv|Marcello|2010|pp=128}}</ref> For even some of the most successful artisans like Revere,<ref>{{Harv|Bartlett|1984|pp=25}}</ref> artisan was not a profitable enterprise compared to mass-production using iron or bronze casting.<ref name=\"Marcello 2010 128\"/> Creating products that could be replicated for multiple customers, adopting new business practices and labor policies, and new equipment made manufacturing more ultimately efficient. These changes, in tandem with new techniques and requirements defined by changing social standards, led to the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in Colonial America that preceded and anticipated the industrial revolution.\n\nLate in the colonial era a few silversmiths expanded operations with manufacturing techniques and changing business practices They hired assistants, subcontracted out piecework and standardized output.<ref>{{Harv|Marcello|2010|pp=7}}</ref> One individual in the vanguard of America's shift towards more industrial methods was [[Paul Revere]], who emphasized the production of increasingly standardized items later in his career with the use of a silver flatting mill, increased numbers of salaried employees, and other advances.<ref>{{Harv|Marcello|2010|pp=107\u2013114}}</ref> Still, traditional methods of artisan remained, and smiths performed a great deal of work by hand. The coexistence of the craft and industrial production styles prior to the industrial revolution is an example of [[proto-industrialization]].\n\n===Factories and mills===\nIn the mid-1780s, [[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill that included a [[grain elevator]] and [[hopper boy]]. Evans' design eventually displaced the traditional [[gristmill]]s. By the turn of the century, Evans also developed one of the first high-pressure [[steam engine]]s and began establishing a network of machine workshops to manufacture and repair these popular inventions. In 1789, the widow of [[Nathanael Greene]] recruited [[Eli Whitney]] to develop a machine to separate the seeds of short fibered cotton from the fibers. The resulting [[cotton gin]] could be made with basic carpentry skills but reduced the necessary labor by a factor of 50 and generated huge profits for cotton growers in the South.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=77}}</ref> While Whitney did not realize financial success from his invention, he moved on to manufacturing rifles and other armaments under a government contract that could be made with \"expedition, uniformity, and exactness\"\u2014the foundational ideas for [[interchangeable parts]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=80}}</ref> However, Whitney's vision of [[interchangeable parts]] would not be achieved for over two decades with firearms and even longer for other devices.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1820, new industrial tools that rapidly increased the quality and efficiency of manufacturing emerged. [[Simeon North]] suggested using [[division of labor]] to increase the speed with which a complete [[pistol]] could be manufactured which led to the development of a [[milling machine]] in 1798. In 1819, [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]] created a [[lathe]] that could reliably cut irregular shapes, like those needed for arms manufacture. By 1822, [[Captain John H. Hall]] had developed a system using [[machine tool]]s, division of labor, and an unskilled workforce to produce a [[breech-loading rifle]]\u2014a process that came to be known as \"[[Armory practice]]\" in the U.S. and the ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'' in England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=81\u201382}}</ref><ref name=\"hounshell-1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref>\n[[File:Boston Manufacturing Company.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Lowell]]'s [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] revolutionized the role of factories.]]\n\nThe [[textile industry]], which had previously relied upon labor-intensive production methods, was also rife with potential for mechanization. In the late 18th century, the English textile industry had adopted the [[spinning jenny]], [[water frame]], and [[spinning mule]] which greatly improved the efficiency and quality of textile manufacture, but were closely guarded by the British government which forbade their export or the emigration of those who were familiar with the technology. The 1787 [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] was the first [[cotton mill]] in the United States, but it relied on horse power. [[Samuel Slater]], an apprentice in one of the largest textile factories in England, immigrated to the United States in 1789 upon learning that American states were paying bounties to British expatriates with a knowledge of textile machinery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=83}}</ref> With the help of [[Moses Brown (Providence)|Moses Brown of Providence]], Slater established America's oldest currently existing cotton-spinning mill with a fully mechanized water power system at the [[Slater Mill]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] in 1793. \n \nHoping to harness the ample power of the [[Merrimack River]], another group of investors began building the [[Middlesex Canal]] up the Mystic River, both Mystic Lakes and generally following stream valleys (near to today's [[MA 38]]) reached the Merrimack in [[Chelmsford, MA|Chelmsford]] {{convert|35|mi}} from Boston Harbor, establishing limited operations by 1808, and a system of [[navigations]] and canals reaching past [[Manchester, NH|Manchester]] by mid-1814&mdash;and spawning commercial activities, and especially new clothing mills throughout the region. At nearly the same time as the canal was completed, [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] and a consortium of businessmen set up the clothing mills in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] making use of water power from the [[Charles River]] with the concept of housing together production of feedstocks complete consumer processes so raw materials entered, and dyed fabrics or clothing left. For a few decades, it seemed that every [[lock (water transport)|lock]] along the canal had mills and water wheels. In 1821, Boston Manufacturing Company built a major expansion in East Chelmsford, which was soon incorporated as [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]&mdash;which came to dominate the cloth production and clothing industry for decades.\n \nSlater's Mill was established in the [[Blackstone Valley]], which extended into neighboring [[Massachusetts]], ([[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]]'s Woolen Mill, 1809 at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]]), and became one of the earliest industrialized region in the United States, second to the North Shore of Massachusetts. Slater's business model of independent mills and mill villages (the \"[[Rhode Island System]]\") began to be replaced by the 1820s by a more efficient system (the \"[[Waltham System]]\") based upon [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]]'s replications of British [[power looms]]. Slater went on to build several more cotton and wool mills throughout [[New England]], but when faced with a labor shortage, resorted to building housing, shops, and churches for the workers and their families adjacent to his factories. The first [[power looms]] for woolens were installed in 1820, at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], by [[John Capron]], of [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]]. These added automated weaving under the same roof, a step which Slater's system outsourced to local farms. Lowell looms were managed by specialized employees, many of the employed were unmarried young women (\"[[Lowell mill girls]]\"), and owned by a corporation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=87}}</ref> Unlike the previous forms of labor ([[apprenticeship]], family labor, [[slavery]], and [[indenture]]), the Lowell system popularized the concept of [[wage laborer]] who sells his labor to an employer under contract\u2014a socio-economic system which persists in many modern countries and industries. The corporation also looked out for the health and well being of the young women, including their spiritual health, and the hundreds of women employed by it culturally established the pattern of a young woman going off to work for a few years and saving money, before returning home to school and marriage. It created an independent breed of women uncommon in most of the world.\n\n===Turnpikes and canals===\n{{main|History of turnpikes and canals in the United States}}\n[[File:Erie Canal, Lock 32.jpg|thumb|left|195px|A lock on the Erie Canal.]]\n[[File:Canals USA 1825.png|thumb|USA canals circa 1825]]\n[[File:Highways USA 1825.png|thumb|Highways in the USA circa 1825]]\n\nEven as the country grew even larger with the admission of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Ohio]] by 1803, the only means of transportation between these landlocked western states and their coastal neighbors was by foot, pack animal, or ship. Recognizing the success of [[Roman road]]s in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=94}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[toll road]]s were constructed and owned by [[joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] that sold stock to raise construction capital like [[Pennsylvania]]'s 1795 [[Lancaster Turnpike|Lancaster Turnpike Company]]. In 1808, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Albert Gallatin]]'s ''Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals'' suggested that the federal government should fund the construction of interstate [[Toll road|turnpikes]] and [[canal]]s. While many [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Anti-Federalists]] opposed the federal government assuming such a role, the British blockade in the War of 1812 demonstrated the United States' reliance upon these overland roads for military operations as well as for general commerce.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=98}}</ref> Construction on the [[National Road]] began in 1815 in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] and reached [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]] in 1818, but political strife thereafter ultimately prevented its western advance to the [[Mississippi River]]. Nevertheless, the road became a primary overland conduit through [[Appalachian Mountains]] and was the gateway for thousands of antebellum westward-bound settlers.\n\nNumerous canal companies had also been chartered; but of all the canals projected, only three had been completed when the War of 1812 began: the [[Dismal Swamp Canal]] in Virginia, the [[Santee Canal]] in South Carolina, and the [[Middlesex Canal]] in Massachusetts. It remained for New York to usher in a new era in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 the construction of the [[Erie Canal]]. This bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia, particularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert much of their traffic to Baltimore. In 1825, the legislature of Pennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals which were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburgh on the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north.<ref>{{Citation |last=Johnson |first=Allen |authorlink=Allen Johnson (historian) |title=Union and Democracy |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1915 |pages=255\u2013256 }}</ref> The [[Blackstone Canal]], (1823\u20131828) in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], and the [[Morris Canal]] across northern [[New Jersey]] (1824\u20131924) soon followed, along with the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] from [[Chicago]] to the [[Illinois River]](1824\u20131848).\n\nLike the turnpikes, the early canals were constructed, owned, and operated by private joint-stock companies but later gave way to larger projects funded by the states. The [[Erie Canal]], proposed by [[Governor of New York]] [[De Witt Clinton]], was the first canal project undertaken as a public good to be financed at the public risk through the issuance of [[Municipal bond|bonds]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=102}}</ref> When the project was completed in 1825, the canal linked [[Lake Erie]] with the [[Hudson River]] through 83 separate locks and over a distance of {{convert|363|mi|km|0}}. The success of the Erie Canal spawned a boom of other canal-building around the country: over {{convert|3326|mi|km}} of artificial waterways were constructed between 1816 and 1840.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=104\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=104}}</ref> Small towns like [[Syracuse, New York]], [[Buffalo, New York]], and [[Cleveland, Ohio]] that lay along major canal routes boomed into major industrial and trade centers, while canal-building pushed some states like [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Indiana]] to the brink of [[bankruptcy]].<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=104\"/>\n\nThe magnitude of the transportation problem was such, however, that neither individual states nor private corporations seemed able to meet the demands of an expanding internal trade. As early as 1807, [[Albert Gallatin]] had advocated the construction of a great system of internal waterways to connect East and West, at an estimated cost of $20,000,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000000|1807|r=0}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} consumer dollars). But the only contribution of the national government to [[internal improvements]] during the Jeffersonian era was an appropriation in 1806 of two percent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands in Ohio for the construction of a national road, with the consent of the states through which it should pass. By 1818 the road was open to traffic from [[Cumberland, Maryland]], to Wheeling, West Virginia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=256}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, with the experiences of the war before him, no well-informed statesman could shut his eyes to the national aspects of the problem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even President Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing \"a comprehensive system of roads and canals\". Soon after Congress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by Calhoun which proposed an appropriation of $1,500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1816|r=0}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} consumer dollars) for internal improvements. Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government, the bill was commonly referred to as the \"Bonus Bill\". But on the day before he left office, President Madison vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional. The policy of internal improvements by federal aid was thus wrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia dynasty. Having less regard for consistency, the House of Representatives recorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals, but had not the power to construct them. As yet the only direct aid of the national government to internal improvements consisted of various appropriations, amounting to about $1,500,000 for the [[Cumberland Road]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=257\u2013258}}</ref>\n\nAs the country recovered from financial depression following the [[Panic of 1819]], the question of internal improvements again forged to the front. In 1822, a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed by the President. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation of the national government in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than [[Henry Clay]]. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Of the other presidential candidates, Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=309\u2013310}}</ref>\n\nIn President Adams' first message to Congress, he advocated not only the construction of roads and canals but also the establishment of [[observatory|observatories]] and a national university. President Jefferson had recommended many of these in 1806 for Congress to consider for creation of necessary amendments to the Constitution. Adams seemed oblivious to the limitations of the Constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In much alarm, Jefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt a new set of resolutions, bottomed on those of 1798, and directed against the acts for internal improvements. In March 1826, the general assembly declared that all the principles of the earlier resolutions applied \"with full force against the powers assumed by Congress\" in passing acts to protect manufacturers and to further internal improvements. That the administration would meet with opposition in Congress was a foregone conclusion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1915|pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\n===Steamboats===\n[[File:Clermont illustration - Robert Fulton - Project Gutenberg eText 15161.jpg|thumb|200px|Fulton's ''North River Steamboat'' on the Hudson.]]\nDespite the new efficiencies introduced by the turnpikes and canals, travel along these routes was still time-consuming and expensive. The idea of integrating a steam [[boiler]] and propulsion system can be first attributed to [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] and [[James Rumsey]] who both filed for patents or state monopolies on [[steamboat]]s in the late 1780s. However, these first steamboats were complicated, heavy, and expensive. It would be almost 20 years until [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]] contracted a civil [[engineering|engineer]] named [[Robert Fulton]] to develop an economical steamboat. Fulton's [[paddle steamer]], ''The North River Steamboat'' (erroneously referred to as the ''Clermont''), made its first trip from New York City north on the Hudson River to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on August 17, 1807. By 1820, steamboat services had been established on all the Atlantic [[river|tidal rivers]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The shallow-bottomed boats were also ideally suited navigating the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River]]s and the number of boats on these rivers increased from 17 boats to 727 boats between 1817 and 1855.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=108}}</ref> The speed of the steamboats decreased travel times between coastal ports and upstream cities by weeks and costs for transporting goods along these rivers by as much as 90%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=110}}</ref>\n\nSteamboats profoundly altered the relationships between the federal government, state governments, and private property owners. Livingston and Fulton had obtained monopoly rights to operate a steamboat service within the state of New York, but Thomas Gibbons, who operated a competing New Jersey ferry service, was [[enjoin]]ed from entering New York waters under the terms of the monopoly. In 1824, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' that Congress could regulate commerce and transportation under the [[Commerce Clause]] which compelled the state of New York to allow steamboat services from other states.\n\nBecause the [[Structural failure|physics]] and [[Wrought iron#Properties|metallurgy]] of boilers were poorly understood, steamboats were prone to [[boiler explosion]]s that killed hundreds of people between the 1810s and 1840s.<ref>{{Citation |last=Burke |first=John G. |chapter=Bursting Boilers and the Federal Power |editor=S.

The earliest proposal came in 1813 from Oliver Evans' idea of a railway to connect New York and Philadelphia with \"carriages drawn by steam engines.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=113}}</ref> Many individuals and companies have a claim to being the [[first railroad in the United States]], but by the mid-1830s several companies were using steam-powered [[locomotive]]s to move [[train car]]s on [[rail tracks]].

However, the early railroads were poorly integrated; there were hundreds of competing companies using different [[Rail gauge|gauges]] for their track requiring cargo to be [[transshipment|trans-shipped]]\u2014rather than traveling directly\u2014between cities.\n\nThe completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869 and its attendant profit and efficiency had the effect of stimulating a period of intense consolidation and technological standardization that would last another 50 years. It was during this time that railroad [[magnates]] such as [[Jay Gould]] and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] amassed great power and fortunes from consolidation of smaller rail lines into national corporations. By 1920, {{convert|254000|mi|km|-2}} of standard-gauge railroad track had been laid in the United States, all of it owned or controlled by seven organizations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=154}}</ref> The need to synchronize train schedules and the inefficiencies introduced by every city having its own local time, also led to introduction of [[Standard time]] by railway managers in 1883.

By the end of the 18th century, the threat of [[deforestation]] forced the English to use [[coke (fuel)|coke]], a fuel derived from [[coal]], to fire their furnaces.

The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large-scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the molten pig iron were developed, allowing the direct conversion of molten pig iron to molten steel.\n\nThroughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, the English steelmakers produced [[blister steel|blister]] and [[crucible steel]] which required specialized equipment like [[finery forge]]s and [[puddling furnace]]s and cost over \u00a350 per [[long ton]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns increased demand for wrought iron and steel.

The [[Kelly-Bessemer process]], because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.\n\nIn 1868, [[Andrew Carnegie]] saw an opportunity to integrate new coke-making methods with the recently developed Kelly-Bessemer process to supply steel for railroads. In 1872, he built a steel plant in [[Braddock, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Braddock, Pennsylvania]] at the junction of several major railroad lines. Carnegie earned enormous profits by pioneering [[vertical integration]]; he owned the iron ore mines in [[Minnesota]], the transport steamboats on the [[Great Lakes]], the coal mines and coke ovens, and the rail lines delivering the coke and ore to his Pennsylvania mills. By 1900, the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] was producing more steel than all of Britain and in 1901 Carnegie sold his business to [[J.P.

Between 1837 and 1844, [[Samuel F.B. Morse]] and [[Alfred Vail]] developed a transmitter that could send \"short\" or \"long\" electric currents which would move an electromagnetic receiver to record the signal as [[Morse Code|dots and dashes]]. Morse established the first [[telegraph]] line (between [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Washington D.C.]]) in 1844 and by 1849 almost every state east of the Mississippi had telegraph service.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=152\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=152}}</ref> Between 1850 and 1865, the telegraph business became progressively more consolidated and the 1866 incorporation of [[Western Union]] emerged with a near-monopoly over 22,000 telegraph offices and {{convert|827000|mi|km|-2}} of cable throughout the country.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=152\" /> The telegraph was used to dispatch news from the fronts of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], coordinate [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troop movements during the Civil War, relay [[stock]] and [[commodity]] prices and orders between markets on [[ticker tape]], and conduct [[diplomacy|diplomatic negotiations]] after the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid in 1866.\n\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] obtained a patent in 1876 to a device that could transmit and reproduce the sound of a voice over electrical cables. Bell realized the enormous potential for his [[telephone]] and formed the [[Bell Telephone Company]] which would control the whole system from the manufacture the telephones and exchange equipment to [[lease|leasing]] the equipment to customers and [[telephone company|operators]]. Between 1877 and 1893 (the term of Bell's patent coverage) the number of phones leased by Bell's company increased from 3,000 to 260,000, although these were largely limited to businesses and government offices that could afford the relatively high rates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=160}}</ref> After the Bell patents expired, thousands of independent operators became incorporated and their competition for services to middle and low-class households as well as rural farmers drove prices down significantly.

Because crude oil needs to be [[distilled]] to extract usable [[fuel oil]]s, [[oil refining]] quickly became a major industry in the area. However, the rural and mountainous terrain of these Pennsylvania oilfields allowed neither economical [[in-situ]] refining nor efficient railroad transportation of extracted oil. Beginning in 1865, the construction of [[oil pipeline]]s to connect the oilfields with railroads or oil refineries alleviated this geographical bottleneck but also put thousands of [[cooper (profession)|coopers]] and [[teamster]]s (who made the barrels and drove the wagons to transport oil) out of business.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=158}}</ref> As the network of oil pipelines expanded, they became more integrated with both the railway and telegraph systems which enabled even greater coordination in production, scheduling, and pricing.\n\n[[John D. Rockefeller]] was a forceful driver of [[horizontal integration|consolidation]] in the [[Petroleum in the United States|American oil industry]]. Beginning in 1865, he bought refineries, railroads, pipelines, and oilfields and ruthlessly eliminated competition to his [[Standard Oil]]. By 1879, he controlled 90% of oil refined in the US.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\" /> Standard Oil used pipelines to directly connect the Pennsylvanian oilfields with the refineries in New Jersey, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, rather than loading and unloading railroad tank cars, which enabled huge gains in efficiency and profitability. Given the unprecedented scale of Standard Oil's network, the company developed novel methods for managing, financing, and organizing its businesses. Because laws governing corporations limited their ability to do business across state lines, Standard Oil pioneered the use of a central [[Trust company|trust]] that owned and controlled the constituent companies in each state.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\" /> The use of trusts by other industries to stifle competition and extract [[monopoly]] prices led to the 1890 passage of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. In the 1911 case of ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]'', the Supreme Court ordered the Standard Oil Trust be disbanded into competing companies that would become [[Exxon]] (Standard Oil of New Jersey), [[Mobil]] (Standard Oil of New York), and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] (Standard Oil of California).\n\nThe demand for petroleum products increased rapidly after the turn of the century as families relied upon [[kerosene]] to heat and light their houses, industries relied upon [[lubricant]]s for machinery, and the ever-more prevalent [[internal combustion engine]] demanded [[gasoline]] fuel. Between 1880 and 1920, the amount of oil refined annually jumped from {{convert|26000000|oilbbl}} to 442 million.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=158\" /> The discovery of large oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and California in the early 20th century touched off \"oil crazes\" and contributed to these states' rapid industrialization. Because these previously agrarian western states lay outside of the various Standard Oil's production and refining networks, cities like [[Long Beach, California]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Houston, Texas]] emerged as major centers for refining and managing these new fields under companies like [[Sunoco]], [[Texaco]], and [[Gulf Oil]].\n\n===Electricity===\n{{Main|Electrification}}\n{{See also|History of electromagnetism|War of currents}}\n[[File:Transmission Towers.jpg|200px|thumb|Electrification revolutionized American industry and commerce.]]\n\n[[Benjamin Franklin]] pioneered the study of electricity by being the first to describe positive and negative charges,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/FranklinBenjamin.html |title=Benjamin Franklin (1706\u20131790) |author=Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> as well as advancing the principle of conservation of charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/gap/Franklin/Franklin.html |title=Benjamin Franklin 1706-1790 |author=American Institute of Physics |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> Franklin is best known for the apocryphal feat of flying a kite in thunderstorm to prove that [[lightning]] is a form of [[electricity]] which, in turn, led to the invention of the [[lightning rod]] to protect buildings.\n\nElectricity would remain a novelty through the early to mid 19th century but advances in battery storage, generating, and lighting would turn it into a domestic business. By the late 1870s and early 1880 central generating plants supplying power to [[arc lamp]]s, first in Europe and then in the US, began spreading rapidly, replacing oil and gas for outdoor lighting, systems that ran on very high voltage (3,000\u20136,000 volt) [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]]. In 1880, [[Thomas Edison]] developed and patented a system for indoor lighting that competed with gas lighting, based on a long-lasting high resistance [[incandescent light bulb]] that ran on relatively low voltage (110 volt) direct current. Commercializing this venture was a task far beyond what Edison's small laboratory could handle, requiring the setup of a large investor backed [[utility]] that involving companies that would manufacture the whole technological system upon which the \"light bulb\" would depend\u2014generators (Edison Machine Company), cables (Edison Electric Tube Company), generating plants and electric service (Edison Electric Light Company), sockets, and bulbs.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=163\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=163}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to lighting, [[electric motor]]s (analogous to generators operating in reverse, or using a current to spin a magnet to perform work) became extremely important to industry. Speed control of early DC motors limited their use. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor (ca. 1886) by solving the problem of varying speed with load. Within a few years DC motors were used in electric street railways.<ref name=\"Nye 1990\">{{cite book |title=Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E. |year=1990 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England}}</ref> In 1888, a [[Serbia]]n immigrant, [[Nikola Tesla]], a former employee of Edison's, patented an AC [[induction motor]] and licensed it to the [[Westinghouse Corporation]].

However, DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing [[voltages]] between industrial generation and residential/commercial consumption and the low voltages used suffered from poor transmission efficiency. The mid 1880s saw the introduction of the [[transformer]], allowing [[alternating current]] to be transmitted at high voltage long distances with greater efficiency and then \"stepped down\" to supply commercial and domestic indoor lighting, resulting in AC going from being the outdoor \"arc lighting current\" to taking over the domestic lighting utility market Edison's DC system was designed to supply. The rapid spread of AC and haphazard installation of power lines, especially in the city of New York, led to a series of deaths attributed to high voltage AC and an eventual media backlash against the current.<ref>Jill Jonnes, ''Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World'', Random House, 2004, page 143</ref><ref>Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'', Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2010, page 280</ref> Starting in 1888 the Edison company played up the dangers of AC power in their literature and assisted self-appointed anti-AC crusader [[Harold P.

This series of events came to be known as the [[war of the currents]]. Brown and Edison's [[lobbying]] in state legislatures went nowhere and the Edison company continued to lose market share and profitability to the AC based companies. In 1892 the \"war\" ended with Thomas Edison losing any remaining control of his own company when it was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], to form [[General Electric]], creating a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.<ref name=\"Mark Essig 2009, page 268\">Mark Essig, ''Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death'', Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009, page 268</ref><ref>Robert L.

Lighting was immensely popular: between 1882 and 1920 the number of generating plants in the US increased from one in downtown Manhattan to nearly 4,000.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=163\" /> While the earliest generating plants were constructed in the immediate vicinity of consumers, plants generating electricity for long-distance transmissions were in place by 1900. To help finance this great expansion, the utility industry exploited a financial innovation known as the \"[[holding company]]\"; a favorite holding company investment among many was the [[Electric Bond and Share Company]] (later much-changed, and known as Ebasco), created by the General Electric company in 1905. The abuse of holding companies, like trusts before it, led to the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/past/h1main.htm|title=Powering A Generation: Power History #2|publisher=}}</ref> but by 1920, electricity had surpassed petroleum-based lighting sources that had dominated the previous century.\n\n===Automobiles===\n{{see also|History of the automobile|Interstate Highway System}}\n[[File:AssemblyLine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Model T]] revolutionized transportation in the 1900s as well as increased production by use of the [[assembly line]]. Shown is a test of mounting the body on the chassis, which was actually done inside the factory by using an [[overhead crane]].]]\nThe technology for creating an [[automobile]] emerged in Germany in the 1870 and 1880s: [[Nicolaus Otto]] created a [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[internal combustion engine]], [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] modified the Otto engine to run at higher speeds, and [[Karl Benz]] pioneered the [[electric ignition]]. The [[Duryea brothers]] and [[Hiram Percy Maxim]] were among the first to construct a \"horseless carriage\" in the US in the mid-1890s, but these early cars proved to be heavy and expensive.\n\n[[Henry Ford]] revolutionized the automobile manufacturing process by employing [[interchangeable parts]] on [[assembly lines]]\u2014the beginning of industrial [[mass production]]. In 1908, the [[Ford Motor Company]] released the [[Ford Model T]] which could generate 20 [[horsepower]], was lightweight, and easy to repair. Demand for the car was so great, he had to relocate his assembly plant to [[Highland Park, Michigan]] in 1912. The new plant was a model of industrial efficiency for the time: it was well lit and ventilated, employed [[conveyor]]s to move parts along an assembly line, and workers' stations were orderly arranged along the line. The efficiency of the assembly line allowed Ford to realize great gains in economy and productivity; in 1912, Ford sold 6,000 cars for approximately $900 and by 1916 approximately 577,000 Model T automobiles were sold for $360.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=229}}</ref> Ford was able to scale production rapidly because assembly-line workers were unskilled laborers performing repetitive tasks. Ford hired European immigrants, African-Americans, ex-convicts, and the disabled and paid comparatively high wages, but was quick to dismiss anyone involved in [[labor union]]s or [[Anarchism in the United States|radical]] [[Socialism in the United States|political]] [[Communist Party USA|associations]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=230}}</ref>\n\n[[File:La city hwys.jpg|230px|left|thumb|[[California]], like much of the United States, is dependent on the [[Interstate Highway System]], which, with larger junctions like this [[stack interchange]], is quite complicated and expensive.]]\n\nWith growth of American automobile usage, urban and rural roads were gradually upgraded for the new traffic. Local automobile clubs formed the [[American Automobile Association]] to [[Lobbying|lobby]] city, state, and federal governments to widen and pave existing roads and build limited-access [[highway]]s. Some federal road aid was passed in the 1910s and 20s (resulting in highways like [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[U.S. Route 66]]). The coverage and quality of many roads would greatly improve following Depression-era [[Works Progress Administration]] investment in road infrastructure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=236}}</ref> New Automobile sales were temporarily slowed during World War II when wartime [[rationing]] and military production lines limited the number of automobiles that could be manufactured\u2014the largest companies like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors|GM]], and [[Chrysler]] would survive those lean years. After the war, [[Baby boom|rising family sizes]], increasing affluence, and government-subsidized mortgages for veterans fueled a boom in single-family homes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=237}}</ref> Many were automobile-owners. In 1956, Congress passed the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] which provided funding for the construction of {{convert|41000|mi|km|-2}} of toll-free expressways throughout the country laying the legislative and infrastructural foundations for the modern American highway system.\n\n==Effects of industrialization==\n===Agricultural production===\n{{Main|Agricultural history of the United States}}\n[[File:GLEANER L2.JPG|thumb|200px|([[Gleaner Manufacturing Company|Gleaner]]) Mechanical [[combine harvester]].]]\nIn the 1840s, as more and more western states joined the Union, many poor and middle-class Americans increasingly agitated for free land in these large, undeveloped areas. Early efforts to pass a Homestead Act by [[George Henry Evans]] and [[Horace Greeley]] were stymied by Southern states who feared that free land would threaten the plantation system. The [[Homestead Act]] was passed in 1862 after the opposing Southern states had [[secede]]d. The Homestead Act granted 160 acres (65 hectares) to farmers who lived on the land for 5 years or allowed the farmer to purchase the land after 6 months for $1.25 per acre ($3/ha).\n\nEven as America's westward expansion allowed over 400 million acres (1,600,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of new land to be put under cultivation, between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=166\">{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=166}}</ref> New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes. [[Cyrus McCormick]]'s reaper (invented in 1834) allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device. [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] invented the [[steel]] plow in 1837, keeping the soil from sticking to the plow and making it easier to farm in the rich [[prairie]]s of the [[Midwest]]. The harvester, self-binder, and combine allowed even greater efficiencies: wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an average yield of 9.9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15.3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=170}}</ref>\n\nRailroads allowed harvests to reach markets more quickly and [[Gustavus Franklin Swift]]'s refrigerated railroad car allowed fresh meat and fish to reach distant markets. Food distribution also became more mechanized as companies like Heinz and Campbell distributed previously perishable foods by canning and evaporation. Commercial bakeries, breweries, and meatpackers replaced locally owned operators and drove demand for raw agricultural goods. Despite increasing demand, rising production caused a drop in prices, creating substantial discontent among farmers. Organizations like [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|The Grange]] and [[Farmers Alliance]] emerged to demand [[Free silver|monetary policy that allowed for money supply expansion]] (as most farmers carried significant debt from planting time to harvest time), railroad regulations, and protective tariffs.\n\n===Urbanization===\nThe period between 1865 and 1920 was marked by the increasing concentration of people, political power, and economic activity in urban areas. In 1860, there were nine cities with populations over 100,000 and by 1910 there were fifty.<ref name=\"Cowan 1997 pp=166\" /> These new large cities were not coastal port cities (like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia) but laid inland along new transportation routes (like Denver, Chicago, and Cleveland). The [[List of Presidents of the United States|first twelve presidents of the United States]] had all been born into farming communities, but between 1865 and 1912 the Presidency was filled by men with backgrounds of representing businesses and cities.\n\nIndustrialization and urbanization reinforced each other and urban areas became increasingly congested. As a result of unsanitary living conditions, diseases like [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhoid fever]] struck urban areas with increasing frequency. Cities responded by paving streets, digging sewers, sanitizing water, constructing housing, and creating public transportation systems.\n\n===Labor issues and immigration===\n{{see also|Labor unions in the United States|Immigration to the United States}}\nAs the nation deepened its technological base, old-fashioned artisans and craftsmen became \"[[deskilling|deskilled]]\" and replaced by specialized workers and engineers who used machines to replicate in minutes or hours work that would require a journeyman hours or days to complete. [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick W. Taylor]], recognizing the inefficiencies introduced by some production lines, proposed that by studying the motions and processes necessary to manufacture each component of a product, reorganizing the factory and manufacturing processes around workers, and paying workers piece rates would allow great gains in process efficiency. Scientific management, or \"Taylorism\" as it came to be known, was soon being applied by progressive city governments to make their urban areas more efficient and by suffragettes to home economics.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=212}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing industrialization outpaced the supply of laborers able or willing to work in dangerous, low-paying, and dead-end jobs. However, the demand for low or unskilled jobs drove wages up and attracted waves of Irish, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Jewish immigrants who could earn more in America than in their homelands.\n\nThe earliest unions emerged before the Civil War as trade guilds composed of journeyman carpenters, masons, and other artisans who would engage in strikes to demand better hours and pay from their masters. All branches of government generally sought to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes.\n\n===Banking, trading, and financial services===\n{{see also|History of banking}}\n[[File:NYSE-floor.jpg|200px|thumb|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].]]\n\nTo finance the larger-scale enterprises required during this era, the Stockholder Corporation emerged as the dominant form of business organization. Corporations expanded by combining into trusts, and by creating single firms out of competing firms, known as monopolies.\nBanking, investment, insurance, consulting, corporations, speculation, business cycle\n\n===Regulation===\nThe [[Progressive movement]] and the [[Progressive Era]] that emerged from it was in part a reaction to excesses of the new industrial age. \"[[Muckraker|Muckraking]]\" journalists reported on a wide array of social issues, and the reaction of the public lent urgency to reforms that led to increased government regulation, such as the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]] (pertaining to railroads), and the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] (1906).\n\n[[File:HooverDamConstruction.jpg|thumb|200px|The Hoover Dam on the Arizona-California border was one of many large-scale water-power projects]]\n\n==Military-industrial-academic complex==\n{{see also|Military-industrial complex}}\nIn the 20th century, the pace of technological developments increasingly became tied into a complex set of interactions between [[United State Congress|Congress]], the industrial manufacturers, university research, and the [[United States military|military establishment]]. This set of relations, known more popularly as the \"military-industrial complex,\" emerged because the military's unique technological demands, concentration of funding, large-scale application, and highly centralized control played a dominant role in driving technological innovation. Fundamental advances in [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[computing]], [[aviation]], [[material science]], [[naval architecture]], and [[meteorology]], among other fields, can be traced back to basic and applied research for military applications.

The [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], established in 1811, broke the mold of traditional universities and military academies alike by including practical engineering-related subjects in its earliest curricula. By the middle of the 19th century, polytechnic institutes were being founded in increasing numbers to train students in the scientific and technical skills needed to design, build, and operate increasingly complex machines. In 1824, [[Stephen van Rensselaer]] established the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|first American institute]] granting a bachelor's degree in technical subjects and in the 1850s several [[Ivy League]] schools began to offer courses of study in scientific fields.\n\nCongressional legislators, recognizing the increasing importance and prevalence of these eastern polytechnic schools, passed the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] providing large grants of land<ref>30,000 acres (120 km\u00b2) of federal land, either within or contiguous to its boundaries, for each member of Congress the state had as of the census of 1860 - a minimum of 90,000 acres (360 km\u00b2). {{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/27.htm |title=Backgrounder on the Morrill Act |publisher=International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State |accessdate=2007-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411041720/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/27.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> that were to be used toward establishing and funding the educational institutions that would teach courses on military tactics, engineering, and agriculture.

The Wright brothers had difficulty raising funding from the government and military, but after [[World War I]] began in 1914, airplanes quickly assumed great tactical importance for both sides (''see'' [[Aviation in World War I]]); the US government appropriated $640 million in 1917 to procure 20,000 airplanes for the war for [[aerial reconnaissance]], [[dogfight]]ing, and [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1997|pp=252}}</ref> After the close of the war in 1918, the US government continued to fund peacetime aeronautical activities like [[airmail]] and the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].

The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] provisionally accepted the Corso in 1997, and ten years later was fully recognised internationally.  In the US, the [[American Kennel Club]] first recognized the Cane Corso in 2010.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Cane Corso\"/> The popularity of the breed continues to grow, ranking in 40th place in the United States in 2016, a jump from 50th place in 2013 and 60th in 2012 <ref>[http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ \"AKC Dog Registration Statistics\"], ''The American Kennel Club'', accessed 20 May 2014</ref> Today the breed is used as a guardian, protection, tracking and police dog.<ref name=UKC/>\n\n\n\n<gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"168px\" heights=\"168px\">\nFile:Cane corso temi 2 1024x768x24.png|Cane Corso with uncropped ears.\nFile:CaneCorso.jpg|Cane Corso, blue coat, cropped ears\nFile:Viggo-Ears-n-Tail.png|Cane Corso with ears and tail, brown/brindle coat\nFile:1 Cyrano 63b.JPG|thumb|Formentino Cane Corso puppy \n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- DO NOT ADD PRIVATE BREEDERS OR ADVERTISING; IT WILL BE REMOVED -->\n<!--Editors: breed registry, club, rescue, and kennel information links are placed on DMOZ, not here-->{{Commons category|Cane Corso}}\n* {{dmoz|Recreation/Pets/Dogs/Breeds/Molosser_Group/Cane_Corso/|Cane Corso}}\n{{Italian dogs}}\n{{Mastiffs}}\n[[Category:FCI breeds]]\n[[Category:Mastiffs]]\n[[Category:Catch dog breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Italy]]\n", "name_user": "Carnby", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_Corso"}
