It returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], elected by the [[first past the post]] voting system. It was created in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]].\n\n== History ==\nA traditionally safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat, represented for 33 years by [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] (who became Speaker in 1976 and was re-elected without party affiliation in 1979). It has returned a [[Conservative Party(UK)|Conservative]] only once, in the Tories' landslide year of 1983, when [[Stefan Terlezki]] became the MP.\n\nLabour regained the seat at the next general election in 1987, when [[Rhodri Morgan]] was elected. After the creation of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]], Morgan stepped down from his Westminster seat in 2001 to serve as leader of [[Welsh Labour]] and [[First Minister for Wales]]. [[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]] retained the seat for Labour on Morgan's retirement from Westminster politics and has remained the MP ever since.\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1950\u20131974''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Canton, Ely, Grangetown, Llandaff, and Riverside.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Canton, Ely, Llandaff, Plasmawr, and Riverside.\n\n'''1983\u20132010''': The City of Cardiff wards of Caerau, Canton, Ely, Fairwater, Llandaff, Radyr and St Fagans, and Riverside.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Cardiff electoral divisions of Caerau, Canton, Creigiau and St Fagans, Ely, Fairwater, Llandaff, Pentyrch, Radyr, and Riverside.\n\nCardiff West is entirely within the boundaries of the city of Cardiff, taking up the northwestern quarter of the borough at the boundaries of the boroughs of [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] and [[Vale of Glamorgan]]. Population areas within the constituency include Riverside, Pontcanna, St Fagans and Ely. There are some Conservative-voting areas in the north of the seat such as Creigiau and St Fagans, Pentyrch and Radyr, but the bulk of the seat comprises districts towards the centre of Cardiff such as Caerau, Canton, Ely and Riverside which are very strongly Labour.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardiff West 1950\u2013|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/cardiff-west|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Rayment-hc|c|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party!!Notes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{nowrap|[[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]]}}\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n| Previously MP for Cardiff Central from 1945.

It returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], elected by the [[first past the post]] voting system. It was created in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]].\n\n== History ==\nA traditionally safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat, represented for 33 years by [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] (who became Speaker in 1976 and was re-elected without party affiliation in 1979). It has returned a [[Conservative Party(UK)|Conservative]] only once, in the Tories' landslide year of 1983, when [[Stefan Terlezki]] became the MP.\n\nLabour regained the seat at the next general election in 1987, when [[Rhodri Morgan]] was elected. After the creation of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]], Morgan stepped down from his Westminster seat in 2001 to serve as leader of [[Welsh Labour]] and [[First Minister for Wales]]. [[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]] retained the seat for Labour on Morgan's retirement from Westminster politics and has remained the MP ever since.\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1950\u20131974''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Canton, Ely, Grangetown, Llandaff, and Riverside.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Canton, Ely, Llandaff, Plasmawr, and Riverside.\n\n'''1983\u20132010''': The City of Cardiff wards of Caerau, Canton, Ely, Fairwater, Llandaff, Radyr and St Fagans, and Riverside.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Cardiff electoral divisions of Caerau, Canton, Creigiau and St Fagans, Ely, Fairwater, Llandaff, Pentyrch, Radyr, and Riverside.\n\nCardiff West is entirely within the boundaries of the city of Cardiff, taking up the northwestern quarter of the borough at the boundaries of the boroughs of [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] and [[Vale of Glamorgan]]. Population areas within the constituency include Riverside, Pontcanna, St Fagans and Ely. There are some Conservative-voting areas in the north of the seat such as Creigiau and St Fagans, Pentyrch and Radyr, but the bulk of the seat comprises districts towards the centre of Cardiff such as Caerau, Canton, Ely and Riverside which are very strongly Labour.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardiff West 1950\u2013|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/cardiff-west|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Rayment-hc|c|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party!!Notes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{nowrap|[[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]]}}\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n| Previously MP for Cardiff Central from 1945.

Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling [[charlatan]]. In this act he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to [[Paris]] where he worked as a street performer.\n\nAt the start of the [[War of the First Coalition]], Tarrare joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]], where ever quadruple the standard military ration was unable to satisfy his large appetite. He would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and with the exception of his eating habits he showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.\n\nGeneral [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]] decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, and employed him as a [[courier]] for the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] forces, severely beaten and underwent a [[mock execution]] before being returned to French lines.\n\nChastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with [[laudanum]], tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] with a case of severe [[tuberculosis]], and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of [[exudative diarrhoea]].\n\n==Early life==\nTarrare was born in rural France, near [[Lyon]], around 1772.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 203\">{{citation|editor=T.

Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling [[charlatan]]. In this act he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to [[Paris]] where he worked as a street performer.\n\nAt the start of the [[War of the First Coalition]], Tarrare joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]], where ever quadruple the standard military ration was unable to satisfy his large appetite. He would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and with the exception of his eating habits he showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.\n\nGeneral [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]] decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, employed him as a [[courier]] for the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] forces, severely beaten and underwent a [[mock execution]] before being returned to French lines.\n\nChastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with [[laudanum]], tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] with a case of severe [[tuberculosis]], and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of [[exudative diarrhoea]].\n\n==Early life==\nTarrare was born in rural France, near [[Lyon]], around 1772.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 203\">{{citation|editor=T.

Although General de&nbsp;Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near [[Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Neustadt]];{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de&nbsp;Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}}\n\nTarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Unable to speak German,{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside [[Landau]].

Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him, and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to which he never returned.<ref name=\"LMPJ1919 204\" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}\n\n==Death==\nFour years later, in 1798, a M.&nbsp;Tessier of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it.

The group's first demo would be presented the same year, entitled ''Blue Summer'' by Sato, remaining incomplete to this day. In May 1988, Fishmans would begin performing live in small venues in Tokyo, and bassist Yuzuru Kashiwabara would join their ranks in August of the same year. Their first recorded appearance was on the 1989 compilation ''Panic Paradise'' where two of their earliest songs make an appearance among four other ska-punk groups. In March 1990, keyboardist Hakase-Sun would join the band for their first solo live performance at Shibuya La.mama. In October of the same year, [[Virgin Records]] Japan (which would later be renamed to Media Remoras) would approach Fishmans with a record deal, which they promptly accepted. In November, Hakase-Sun officially joined the band, completing the band's original lineup before their first performance at ''Shibuya Club Quattro'' in March 1991. Roughly two years after their appearance on ''Panic Paradise'', their first album ''Chappie Don't Cry'' was released, produced by musician Kazufumi Kodama. This followed the April 21st release of single ''{{nihongo|Hikoki|\u3072\u3053\u3046\u304d}}'', the first of the band's numerous singles. Mr. Kodama had previous fame with the founding of influential Japanese dub group [[Mute Beat]], and his pitch to create ''Chappie Don't Cry'' with Fishmans was simply stating to the group \"let's make a [[rocksteady]] album\".<ref name=\"fishmans.jp\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fishmans.jp/|title=fishmans|website=www.fishmans.jp}}</ref> After the record, Kodama would no longer appear on any Fishmans project, leaving the record to live on as their most straightforward reggae outing in their discography by many fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/review?id=81177855|title=Review #81177855 - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> Producer ZAK would make his first of many appearances with Fishmans for a live concert performed that year in June, marking the beginning of a long collaborative history between him and band writer Sato.\n\nLater the same year, Fishmans' self-produced first [[Extended Play|EP]] ''Corduroy's Mood'' would be released. The record was a profoundly more [[shibuya-kei]] take on reggae than their previous music, allowing the band to better experiment and brainstorm more complex compositions. The project was meant to express \"a feeling of winter\" within its four track runtime, and bears an only faint resemblance to their first [[LP Record|LP]] due to its experimental nature. The band quickly developed a very easy-going sound (mainly influenced by reggae and dub, but also including elements of [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[drum and bass]], [[hip hop]], [[ska]], etc.), which was always coupled with Sato's distinctive androgynous vocals, slowly earning them significant acceptance in Japan's underground scene.\n\nIn 1992, the Japanese broadcasting company [[Fuji TV]] approached the group to write a theme song for television show ''{{nihongo|90 Days Totenam Pub|90\u65e5\u9593\u30c8\u30c6\u30ca\u30e0\u30d1\u30d6}}'', and in response the band produced the first of many renditions of ''{{nihongo|100mm-Chottono|100\u30df\u30ea\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u306e}}''. The song aired on the program as an opener from January to March of that year, and the group released the track as a single on February 5.<ref name=\"fishmans.jp\"/>\n\nFrom May to June 1992, Fishmans recorded with Japanese musician Haruo Kubota. Not much is known of these attempts to record, however it is known that after a night of getting drunk on sake, Kubota called the group to record in the studio in the middle of the night, causing significant confusion and embarrassment within the band members. This marked the end of the group's relations with the musician as they released their second album on October 21, ''King Master George''. The record took a much more experimental direction with their sound, featuring everything from [[jazz rock]] to [[sunshine pop]], throwing multiple styles to the wall to see what sticks. This included a reimagined version of ''100\u30df\u30ea\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u306e'', as well as introducing newer classics like ''{{nihongo|Nantettano|\u306a\u3093\u3066\u3063\u305f\u306e}}'' and ''{{nihongo|Tayorinai Tenshi|\u983c\u308a\u306a\u3044\u5929\u4f7f}}''. Despite this experimentation, Fishmans always succeeded in avoiding Reggae cliches, keeping a Dub foundation powered by Motegi and Kashiwabara's rock-steady rhythm section.\n\nThe following year in 1993, Fishmans collaborated with ZAK in the studio for the first time to release ''Walkin''' on February 19th. This was to much acclaim, which led the producer to continue working with them in another recording session in May. Multiple others would follow as the band worked to create their following single ''{{nihongo|Ikareta Baby|\u3044\u304b\u308c\u305fBaby|}}'', a shockingly popular song that pushed the group to significant radio play at release, becoming their first breakout song. Naturally, this led to more collaborations with ZAK and the release of their third LP ''Neo Yankees' Holiday'', including both aforementioned tracks, as well as the classic ''Smilin' Days, Summer Holiday''. The record cemented Fishmans' sound in a distinctly [[dub music|dub]] style, tinged with pleasant melodies and mellow sounds throughout. The band would follow the release of this record with many live performances, including appearances at Shibuya Parco, Shinsaibashi Club Quattro, and Nissin Power Station. They would proceed to tour around Tokyo from November 1 until the end of the year, changing their sound to approach a more rock-laiden style in preparation for the release of a fourth album.\n\nOn February 2, 1994, Fishmans released their maxi-single ''Go Go Round This World!'', furthering the sound achieved on ''Neo Yankees' Holiday'' towards a more [[funk]] oriented direction. The single included a popular alternate mix of ''Smilin' Days, Summer Holiday'' that transformed the laid-back dub track into an energetic and bombastic jam that foreshadowed the sensibilities coming in their next album. This time of rapid maturation led to guitarist Kensuke Ojima leaving the group in May of that year, letting the band of four continue without him. Despite this sudden departure, the group released their second maxi-single on June 17 entitled ''Melody'', a groovy piano-based production that served as one of Fishmans' most important singles going forward. The maxi-single also marked the first time Fishmans printed any of their material on vinyl as well as CD, the single being printed on 12\" analogue vinyl in a limited quantity of 1000 to be offered only at live venues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Fishmans-Melody/release/7482011|title=Fishmans - Melody|website=Discogs}}</ref> After this release, the group managed to recruit [[Buffalo Daughter]] guitarist suGar Yoshinaga for further recording intended for their next album. On October 21, single ''My Life'' and new album ''Orange'' were released simultaneously, taking the group towards a more defined [[funk rock]] sound, along with a newly redefined version of ''Melody''. Certain tracks on the release, such as ''{{nihongo|Way Home|\u5e30\u308a\u9053|}}'' foreshadowed their turn towards dream pop which would follow in the later 90s. These advancements in musical style would only advance further with the coming of 1995, showing the group's versatility in sound.\n\n===1995\u20131998: ''Aerial Camp'', ''Long Season'', and ''Uchu Nippon Setagaya''===\nOn March 17, 1995, Fishmans released their first live album ''Oh! Mountain'' following a five-city tour in celebration of ''Orange'''s release. The album isn't a \"true live\" album however, as much of the content presented was remixed by ZAK in studio to improve sound quality and add interesting sounds to create a unique home listening experience. The recordings included on the album originated from a total of 11 different concerts.\n\nIt was the spring after the release of ''Oh! Mountain'' that Fishmans signed with [[Polydor Records]]. Polydor had supplied the group with their own recording studio, Waikiki Beach, where they began recording new material in August. That September, a celebratory live concert titled \"Let's Polydor\" was held to encourage the move away from Media Remoras. Unfortunately, Hakase-Sun was to leave the group immediately following this concert, and the resulting trio would work with a series of guest musicians on their next records, primarily Honzi (keyboards, violin, accordion and vocals) of A Decade-In Fake<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=A%20Decade-In%20Fake|title=A Decade-In Fake|website=ArtistInfo}}</ref> (later Honzi's World) and Shinya Kogure (guitar) of Hicksville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kogureshinya?lang=en|title=\u6728\u66ae\u664b\u4e5f EZ LISTENING (@kogureshinya) &#124; Twitter|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The further solidification of ZAK on sound mixing rounded out this second phase of the band, which further evolved its sound to incorporate space rock, ambient and psychedelic elements. Song length and scope continued to grow as well, as these new tendencies blended with their dub foundation. Following this significant lineup change, Fishmans released what is possibly the band's most recognizable single, \"{{nihongo|Nightcruising|\uff85\uff72\uff84\uff78\uff99\uff70\uff7c\uff9e\uff9d\uff78\uff9e|}}\" on November 25. The song was a sudden yet welcome shift towards [[dream pop]], serving as an introduction to what would become their next studio album.\n\nOn February 1, 1996, Fishmans would release their fifth studio album ''{{nihongo|Aerial Camp|\u7a7a\u4e2d\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7|}}'', which readily flaunted a more stripped down, tight production quality. Producer ZAK and writer Sato would often work together on the record to create songs that were more stripped down to their most basic elements, instead of flooding them with lush backgrounds, which contributed to a simpler, cleaner and more crisp output. This, along with the group's much more mature dream pop sensibilities helped to cement the group as a serious, legitimate rock act in the wider world stage. This would become a consistent style of Fishmans' music for the remainder of their career, further separating them from their earlier days of simple reggae music. The album was also printed on limited edition colored vinyl, making this the first of Fishmans' albums to be printed on vinyl records. In celebration of a successful album release, the group embarked on a 10-show tour titled ''{{nihongo|Young But Historical|\u82e5\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u6b74\u53f2\u3042\u308a}}'' which would much later be printed on DVD video. During these tours, support guitarist Michigo \"Darts\" Sekiguchi would agree to permanently accompany Fishmans for support during the remainder of their career. Following this on March 27, Fishmans released the mellow, yet popular single ''Baby Blue'' from ''Aerial Camp'' which reminded of Fishmans' more sensible, soft side contrasting with their new dream pop sound.\n\nDespite their relatively wide success, Sato and company found it attractive to experiment with alternative sounds and projects they had never attempted before. Starting in July, the band began to record standalone single ''Season'' to tease their upcoming full-length LP ''[[Long Season]]'', a 35-minute-long epic based heavily on ''Season'' divided into five parts. The group finished in August, however ''Season'' was only released on September 25 and its accompanying album on October 25. Recorded in their Waikiki Beach private studio, the lyrics and melodies presented on the album are intended to be incredibly personal to Sato and to present a dreamlike musical experience. This would ultimately become their most recognizable studio album among underground music communities for its experimentation and truly unique structure. On underground music community [[Rate Your Music]] as of April 11, 2019, ''Long Season'' has been user-rated as the best neo-psychedelia album of all time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=neo-psychedelia&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=both&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> as well as the second best dream pop album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=dream+pop&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=both&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> and second best progressive pop album of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=progressive+pop&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=both&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> Following the album's release, Fishmans performed the song live on its own for the first time, and with every consecutive performance of the song, the band intended to change the composition so that it would never be played the same twice. Towards the year's end, Fishmans played in Kobe, Nagoya and Tokyo for a new tour entitled LONG SEASON '96\uff5e'97.\n\nThrough February to June 1997, Fishmans would consistently record new material in their Waikiki Beach studio, making this the longest continuous period of time they spent actively recording. At a very early stage during these recordings, the group began recording with music software [[Pro Tools]], completing their new material entirely within the program. On July 2, their single ''Magic Love'' was released to tease their next project, coupled with a b-side remixed by Hiroshi Kawabe of Tokyo No. 1 Soul Set fame. Fishmans had been growing a friendship with the group, and this remix solidified that relationship between the two bands.\n\nTheir final studio project, ''{{nihongo|Uchu Nippon Setagaya|\u5b87\u5b99 \u65e5\u672c \u4e16\u7530\u8c37|}}'', was released on July 24 and took the group in a much more ambient pop direction than their previous LPs. Lyrically, the album focused on personal everyday life while retaining a wide worldview that inspired the title of the record, steadily magnifying from space, down to Japan, and down to the city of Setagaya. The album included single ''Magic Love'', as well as standout tracks ''Walking in the Rhythm'', ''Weather Report'' and others, pushing much of the record to stand out as a classic in their discography. To coincide with the album's release, a tour entitled ''{{nihongo|Uchu Nippon Okudaism|\u5b87\u5b99 \u65e5\u672c \u5965\u7530\u30a4\u30ba\u30e0}}'' was conducted, which included twelve shows across Japan.\n\nThe four-track remix maxi-single ''Walking in the Rhythm'' was also released on October 22, showing the group's prowess in revitalizing their compositions in new and interesting ways, as well as the group's fondness for that particular song. This was followed by the ''Walking In The \u5965\u7530\u30a4\u30ba\u30e0'' tour through Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo, one such full concert (conducted on December 12) being broadcast in full by Japanese music television program [[Space Shower TV]] on February 22, 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://imgur.com/a/q2KX0OS|title=live shower 1997.12.12|website=Imgur}}</ref> Fishmans proceeded to make numerous appearances on Space Shower TV throughout 1998, after which in 2007 three \"episodes\" were released on DVD cataloging their complete broadcasts on the program. These mostly consisted of a multitude of rare live concerts and interviews, as well as a full music video for ''Long Season'' on Episode 2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/video/fishmans/in-space-shower-tv-episode_2/|title=In Space Shower TV Episode.2 by Fishmans|via=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> and a half-hour long live dub mix of Walking in the Rhythm and It's Just A Feeling on Episode 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/video/fishmans/in-space-shower-tv-episode_3/|title=In Space Shower TV Episode.3 by Fishmans|via=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nBeginning at the start of the year, the group began organizing a new live album after their 1997 live performances at their private studio, as well as at Polydor's studios. Meanwhile, in March, the group performed in concert again at four locations in Japan in their ''{{nihongo|Bass Bash|\u4f4e\u97f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5}}'' tour. Their live album was completed in May and released on August 19, titled ''{{nihongo|The Current Situation In August|8\u6708\u306e\u73fe\u72b6}}'', a remixed and newly produced compilation of Fishmans' best live performances from 1996 to 1998. This style of remixed live performances bore significant resemblance to their previous live output ''Oh! Mountain'', leaving the two albums to be easily compared as sibling releases. A tour was conducted by the same name in August to coincide with the live album's release, concluding on October 10 at [[Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall]] which included a complete performance of unreleased song ''A Piece of Future'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFaN8Oe4oKQ|title=Fishmans - A PIECE OF FUTURE Live 98.10.10 @\u65e5\u6bd4\u8c37\u91ce\u5916\u97f3\u697d\u5802 VIDEO|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> a song that seemed to foreshadow a turn towards [[post-rock]] for the band.\n\nIn July of that year, the band began work on a longer length, new song titled ''{{nihongo|Flickering in the Air|\u3086\u3089\u3081\u304d in the Air|}}'', a 13-minute long movement not found on any studio album of theirs, although taking the same sonic style as their previous LP ''Uchu Nippon Setagaya''. This long-form song structure was in similar fashion to their previous LP ''Long Season'', although not nearly on the same grandiose scale. Following the single's December 2 release, however, band member Yuzuru Kashiwabara expressed disinterest in continuing his musical career, electing to leave the band with the coming of the new year.\n\n===1998\u20132004: ''Otokotachi no Wakare'', death of Sato, and disbandment===\nIn December 1998, Fishmans held five concerts for the ''{{nihongo|Man's Farewell Tour|\u7537\u9054\u306e\u5225\u308c\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc}}'' to grant bass player Kashiwabara a last hurrah with the group. The tour concluded with two back-to-back shows, one on December 27 and the other on the 28th, both performed at [[Akasaka BLITZ]] in Minato.\n\nFishmans [[98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare|performed their final concert on December 28, 1998]]. That night, they played many of their most widely acclaimed songs and concluded with a full performance of ''[[Long Season]]''.  This was to be Kashiwabara's final performance with the band, and Sato with Motegi planned to continue working as Fishmans.  However, tragedy struck the band on March 15, 1999 when Sato suddenly died. Fishmans' last concert was released as the live album ''[[98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare]]'' on September 29, 1999. It has gone on to receive strong critical and fan praise; on [[Rate Your Music]] (as of February 2020), ''98.12.28'' has been user-rated as the best live album of all time, with over five thousand individual ratings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=only&include_live=t&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nThe passing of Sato was so sudden that Polydor, their record label had already prematurely scheduled the release of two compilation releases for only two days after his death. ''Fishmans 1991-1994 Singles & More'', a compilation of Media Remoras-era releases was released on March 17, as well as ''The Three Birds and More Feelings'', a collection of the band's [[Music video|PVs]] on VHS (later re-pressed on DVD) recorded by Kensuke Kawamura.\n\nLater in the year on June 30, the compilation album ''Aloha Polydor'' was released, featuring many of Fishmans' Polydor-era songs as well as an unreleased demo of ''{{nihongo|It's Just A Feeling|\u305d\u308c\u306f\u305f\u3060\u306e\u6c17\u5206\u3055|}}'', a song Fishmans had been working on at the time of Sato's death. The following month, Motegi was supported by guest musicians on a three-show live event in Japan titled ''{{nihongo|Fishmans Union|\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30de\u30f3\u30ba\u7684\u7d44\u5408}}'' under the Fishmans name.\n\nBreaking into the twenty-first century was incredibly difficult for Fishmans with the loss of their lead vocalist and writer. On October 25, 2000, the live video album ''{{nihongo|Increased Memory|\u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u5897\u5927}}'' was released, cataloging many rare videos of live performances Fishmans made over the years with Sato. The following month, a live event was held at Shinjuku Liquid Room to synchronize with the video performances where a band played over the video, including Motegi on drums. The event was held again in April 2001 at Nagoya and Osaka, spreading awareness of the video album's release.\n\nAfter Sato's death, Kin-Ichi Motegi began working as a stand-in drummer for [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]], whose original drummer died around the same time as Sato.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realsound.jp/2014/08/post-1070.html|title=\u300c\u6ce3\u304d\u7b11\u3044\u306e\u611f\u52d5\u3092\u305a\u3063\u3068\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u3066\u308b\u300d\u6771\u4eac\u30b9\u30ab\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc25\u5e74\u306e\u6b69\u307f|website=Real Sound\uff5c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9}}</ref>  He eventually became a full-fledged member of the band and plays drums and sings lead vocals with them. Kashiwabara, who had originally planned to abandon the music industry, eventually joined forces with Yusuke Oya (ex-LabLife) to form Polaris,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elrick.com/artists/yuzurukashiwabara/|title=Yuzuru Kashiwabara|date=July 2, 2017|website=Elrick Bass Guitars}}</ref> whose spacey and dubby tracks bear significant resemblance to Fishmans' sound in the late '90s. Both Motegi and Kashiwabara would later join forces with Takashi Kato of Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra and Losalios to form rock group So Many Tears,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.somanytears.net/profile.html|title=PROFILE - So many tears|website=www.somanytears.net}}</ref> whose music leans further towards indie rock and alternative rock productions than that of Fishmans' more dub-influenced sound.\n\n===2004\u2013present: Fishmans+===\nFishmans' popularity only continued to grow, even after Sato's untimely passing. In 2004, a tribute album ''Sweet Dreams for Fishmans'' was released, including covers by artists as diverse as [[OOIOO]], [[Bonobos (band)|Bonobos]], and [[UA (singer)|UA]]. This was followed by the compilation albums ''Kuchu'' and ''Uchu'' in 2005, which included rare and unreleased tracks alongside their best hits. Among these was ''A Piece of Future'', a 10-minute long post-rock track only ever performed live by Fishmans finally released to the public. This song was later remixed by tribute project ''Fishmans+'', a project whose membership includes the likes of [[Cornelius (musician)|Cornelius]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and many other Japanese musicians, as well as a large majority of original Fishmans members. In August 2018, all of Fishmans' music was contributed to [[Spotify]], [[iTunes]] and [[YouTube]] to stream for free, although much of their lesser-known material remains obscure. Nevertheless, this has helped to significantly increase Fishmans' fanbase, especially overseas in North America and Europe.\n\nOn November 22, 2005 the remaining members of Fishmans paid tribute to their fans and Shinji Sato by performing live at the Rising Sun Rock Festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/fishmans/2005/tarukawa-dock-open-air-special-stages-ishikari-japan-2bfc48fe.html|title=Fishmans Setlist at Rising Sun Rock Festival in Ezo 2005|website=setlist.fm}}</ref> The show lasted three and a half hours, and featured many guest singers, who performed on vocals. The following month, a tribute art exhibition \"The Long Season Rewind\" was held in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] with contributions from various artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nug.jp/fishmans_en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190120/http://www.nug.jp/fishmans_en.html|title=The Fishmans Exhibition \uff5eTHE LONG SEASON REWIND \uff5e |website=NANZUKA UNDERGROUND|archive-date=2007-06-30}}</ref> In the same month, live compilation single ''\u3044\u304b\u308c\u305fBaby / \u611f\u8b1d(\u9a5a) / Weather Report'' was released, featuring three remixed live performed songs courtesy of ZAK.\n\nIn 2006, ''The Long Season Revue'' was released on [[DVD]], which contained a nearly complete live video of Fishmans' tribute concert on November 22 of the previous year. A complete performance of Long Season was conducted at the concert, however for unknown reasons it is not present on ''The Long Season Revue''. The live video was originally only screened in theatres and it featured the original members of the band together with a cast of supporting musicians such as [[UA (singer)|UA]], [[Asa-Chang]], Hanaregumi, Oki Yuichi (of [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]]) and Ikuko Harada of Clammbon.<ref>https://www.hmv.co.jp/en/artist_Fishmans_000000000012997/item_Long-Season-Revue_1275603?</ref> Following these concerts, Honzi, long-time contributor with the band, passed away in 2007.\n\nSince 2006, the band has played a number live shows at festivals. On May 3, 2011, Fishmans held a three-hour-long revival concert at Hibiya Nozon which was recorded and distributed on DVD by Campsite TV, in similar fashion to the Fishmans Space Shower TV episodes printed in 2007. In 2016, the group played 3 shows in Nagoya, Tokyo and Osaka featuring a number of original band members and guests. Most recently in February 2019, Fishmans collaborated live with Japanese jazz-rock group cero at Zepp Tokyo,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinra.net/news/20181108-fishmans|title=\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30de\u30f3\u30ba\u300e\u95d8\u9b42\u300f\u7d0420\u5e74\u3076\u308a\u306b\u958b\u50ac cero\u3068\u6765\u5e742\u6708\u306b\u5bfe\u30d0\u30f3|website=CINRA.NET}}</ref> a venue Fishmans would visit for the first time in 20 years.

The group's first demo would be presented the same year, entitled ''Blue Summer'' by Sato, remaining incomplete to this day. In May 1988, Fishmans would begin performing live in small venues in Tokyo, and bassist Yuzuru Kashiwabara would join their ranks in August of the same year. Their first recorded appearance was on the 1989 compilation ''Panic Paradise'' where two of their earliest songs make an appearance among four other ska-punk groups. In March 1990, keyboardist Hakase-Sun would join the band for their first solo live performance at Shibuya La.mama. In October of the same year, [[Virgin Records]] Japan (which would later be renamed to Media Remoras) would approach Fishmans with a record deal, which they promptly accepted. In November, Hakase-Sun officially joined the band, completing the band's original lineup before their first performance at ''Shibuya Club Quattro'' in March 1991. Roughly two years after their appearance on ''Panic Paradise'', their first album ''Chappie Don't Cry'' was released, produced by musician Kazufumi Kodama. This followed the April 21st release of single ''{{nihongo|Hikoki|\u3072\u3053\u3046\u304d}}'', the first of the band's numerous singles. Mr. Kodama had previous fame with the founding of influential Japanese dub group [[Mute Beat]], and his pitch to create ''Chappie Don't Cry'' with Fishmans was simply stating to the group \"let's make a [[rocksteady]] album\".<ref name=\"fishmans.jp\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fishmans.jp/|title=fishmans|website=www.fishmans.jp}}</ref> After the record, Kodama would no longer appear on any Fishmans project, leaving the record to live on as their most straightforward reggae outing in their discography by many fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/review?id=81177855|title=Review #81177855 - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> Producer ZAK would make his first of many appearances with Fishmans for a live concert performed that year in June, marking the beginning of a long collaborative history between him and band writer Sato.\n\nLater the same year, Fishmans' self-produced first [[Extended Play|EP]] ''Corduroy's Mood'' would be released. The record was a profoundly more [[shibuya-kei]] take on reggae than their previous music, allowing the band to better experiment and brainstorm more complex compositions. The project was meant to express \"a feeling of winter\" within its four track runtime, and bears an only faint resemblance to their first [[LP Record|LP]] due to its experimental nature. The band quickly developed a very easy-going sound (mainly influenced by reggae and dub, but also including elements of [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[drum and bass]], [[hip hop]], [[ska]], etc.), which was always coupled with Sato's distinctive androgynous vocals, slowly earning them significant acceptance in Japan's underground scene.\n\nIn 1992, the Japanese broadcasting company [[Fuji TV]] approached the group to write a theme song for television show ''{{nihongo|90 Days Totenam Pub|90\u65e5\u9593\u30c8\u30c6\u30ca\u30e0\u30d1\u30d6}}'', and in response the band produced the first of many renditions of ''{{nihongo|100mm-Chottono|100\u30df\u30ea\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u306e}}''. The song aired on the program as an opener from January to March of that year, and the group released the track as a single on February 5.<ref name=\"fishmans.jp\"/>\n\nFrom May to June 1992, Fishmans recorded with Japanese musician Haruo Kubota. Not much is known of these attempts to record, however it is known that after a night of getting drunk on sake, Kubota called the group to record in the studio in the middle of the night, causing significant confusion and embarrassment within the band members. This marked the end of the group's relations with the musician as they released their second album on October 21, ''King Master George''. The record took a much more experimental direction with their sound, featuring everything from [[jazz rock]] to [[sunshine pop]], throwing multiple styles to the wall to see what sticks. This included a reimagined version of ''100\u30df\u30ea\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u306e'', as well as introducing newer classics like ''{{nihongo|Nantettano|\u306a\u3093\u3066\u3063\u305f\u306e}}'' and ''{{nihongo|Tayorinai Tenshi|\u983c\u308a\u306a\u3044\u5929\u4f7f}}''. Despite this experimentation, Fishmans always succeeded in avoiding Reggae cliches, keeping a Dub foundation powered by Motegi and Kashiwabara's rock-steady rhythm section.\n\nThe following year in 1993, Fishmans collaborated with ZAK in the studio for the first time to release ''Walkin''' on February 19th. This was to much acclaim, which led the producer to continue working with them in another recording session in May. Multiple others would follow as the band worked to create their following single ''{{nihongo|Ikareta Baby|\u3044\u304b\u308c\u305fBaby|}}'', a shockingly popular song that pushed the group to significant radio play at release, becoming their first breakout song. Naturally, this led to more collaborations with ZAK and the release of their third LP ''Neo Yankees' Holiday'', including both aforementioned tracks, as well as the classic ''Smilin' Days, Summer Holiday''. The record cemented Fishmans' sound in a distinctly [[dub music|dub]] style, tinged with pleasant melodies and mellow sounds throughout. The band would follow the release of this record with many live performances, including appearances at Shibuya Parco, Shinsaibashi Club Quattro, and Nissin Power Station. They would proceed to tour around Tokyo from November 1 until the end of the year, changing their sound to approach a more rock-laiden style in preparation for the release of a fourth album.\n\nOn February 2, 1994, Fishmans released their maxi-single ''Go Go Round This World!'', furthering the sound achieved on ''Neo Yankees' Holiday'' towards a more [[funk]] oriented direction. The single included a popular alternate mix of ''Smilin' Days, Summer Holiday'' that transformed the laid-back dub track into an energetic and bombastic jam that foreshadowed the sensibilities coming in their next album. This time of rapid maturation led to guitarist Kensuke Ojima leaving the group in May of that year, letting the band of four continue without him. Despite this sudden departure, the group released their second maxi-single on June 17 entitled ''Melody'', a groovy piano-based production that served as one of Fishmans' most important singles going forward. The maxi-single also marked the first time Fishmans printed any of their material on vinyl as well as CD, the single being printed on 12\" analogue vinyl in a limited quantity of 1000 to be offered only at live venues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Fishmans-Melody/release/7482011|title=Fishmans - Melody|website=Discogs}}</ref> After this release, the group managed to recruit [[Buffalo Daughter]] guitarist suGar Yoshinaga for further recording intended for their next album. On October 21, single ''My Life'' and new album ''Orange'' were released simultaneously, taking the group towards a more defined [[funk rock]] sound, along with a newly redefined version of ''Melody''. Certain tracks on the release, such as ''{{nihongo|Way Home|\u5e30\u308a\u9053|}}'' foreshadowed their turn towards dream pop which would follow in the later 90s. These advancements in musical style would only advance further with the coming of 1995, showing the group's versatility in sound.\n\n===1995\u20131998: ''Aerial Camp'', ''Long Season'', and ''Uchu Nippon Setagaya''===\nOn March 17, 1995, Fishmans released their first live album ''Oh! Mountain'' following a five-city tour in celebration of ''Orange'''s release. The album isn't a \"true live\" album however, as much of the content presented was remixed by ZAK in studio to improve sound quality and add interesting sounds to create a unique home listening experience. The recordings included on the album originated from a total of 11 different concerts.\n\nIt was the spring after the release of ''Oh! Mountain'' that Fishmans signed with [[Polydor Records]]. Polydor had supplied the group with their own recording studio, Waikiki Beach, where they began recording new material in August. That September, a celebratory live concert titled \"Let's Polydor\" was held to encourage the move away from Media Remoras. Unfortunately, Hakase-Sun was to leave the group immediately following this concert, and the resulting trio would work with a series of guest musicians on their next records, primarily Honzi (keyboards, violin, accordion and vocals) of A Decade-In Fake<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=A%20Decade-In%20Fake|title=A Decade-In Fake|website=ArtistInfo}}</ref> (later Honzi's World) and Shinya Kogure (guitar) of Hicksville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kogureshinya?lang=en|title=\u6728\u66ae\u664b\u4e5f EZ LISTENING (@kogureshinya) &#124; Twitter|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The further solidification of ZAK on sound mixing rounded out this second phase of the band, which further evolved its sound to incorporate space rock, ambient and psychedelic elements. Song length and scope continued to grow as well, as these new tendencies blended with their dub foundation. Following this significant lineup change, Fishmans released what is possibly the band's most recognizable single, \"{{nihongo|Nightcruising|\uff85\uff72\uff84\uff78\uff99\uff70\uff7c\uff9e\uff9d\uff78\uff9e|}}\" on November 25. The song was a sudden yet welcome shift towards [[dream pop]], serving as an introduction to what would become their next studio album.\n\nOn February 1, 1996, Fishmans would release their fifth studio album ''{{nihongo|Aerial Camp|\u7a7a\u4e2d\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7|}}'', which readily flaunted a more stripped down, tight production quality. Producer ZAK and writer Sato would often work together on the record to create songs that were more stripped down to their most basic elements, instead of flooding them with lush backgrounds, which contributed to a simpler, cleaner and more crisp output. This, along with the group's much more mature dream pop sensibilities helped to cement the group as a serious, legitimate rock act in the wider world stage. This would become a consistent style of Fishmans' music for the remainder of their career, further separating them from their earlier days of simple reggae music. The album was also printed on limited edition colored vinyl, making this the first of Fishmans' albums to be printed on vinyl records. In celebration of a successful album release, the group embarked on a 10-show tour titled ''{{nihongo|Young But Historical|\u82e5\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u6b74\u53f2\u3042\u308a}}'' which would much later be printed on DVD video. During these tours, support guitarist Michigo \"Darts\" Sekiguchi would agree to permanently accompany Fishmans for support during the remainder of their career. Following this on March 27, Fishmans released the mellow, yet popular single ''Baby Blue'' from ''Aerial Camp'' which reminded of Fishmans' more sensible, soft side contrasting with their new dream pop sound.\n\nDespite their relatively wide success, Sato and company found it attractive to experiment with alternative sounds and projects they had never attempted before. Starting in July, the band began to record standalone single ''Season'' to tease their upcoming full-length LP ''[[Long Season]]'', a 35-minute-long epic based heavily on ''Season'' divided into five parts. The group finished in August, however ''Season'' was only released on September 25 and its accompanying album on October 25. Recorded in their Waikiki Beach private studio, the lyrics and melodies presented on the album are intended to be incredibly personal to Sato and to present a dreamlike musical experience. This would ultimately become their most recognizable studio album among underground music communities for its experimentation and truly unique structure. On underground music community [[Rate Your Music]] as of April 11, 2019, ''Long Season'' has been user-rated as the best neo-psychedelia album of all time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=neo-psychedelia&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=both&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> as well as the second best dream pop album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=dream+pop&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=both&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> and second best progressive pop album of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=progressive+pop&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=both&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> Following the album's release, Fishmans performed the song live on its own for the first time, and with every consecutive performance of the song, the band intended to change the composition so that it would never be played the same twice. Towards the year's end, Fishmans played in Kobe, Nagoya and Tokyo for a new tour entitled LONG SEASON '96\uff5e'97.\n\nThrough February to June 1997, Fishmans would consistently record new material in their Waikiki Beach studio, making this the longest continuous period of time they spent actively recording. At a very early stage during these recordings, the group began recording with music software [[Pro Tools]], completing their new material entirely within the program. On July 2, their single ''Magic Love'' was released to tease their next project, coupled with a b-side remixed by Hiroshi Kawabe of Tokyo No. 1 Soul Set fame. Fishmans had been growing a friendship with the group, and this remix solidified that relationship between the two bands.\n\nTheir final studio project, ''{{nihongo|Uchu Nippon Setagaya|\u5b87\u5b99 \u65e5\u672c \u4e16\u7530\u8c37|}}'', was released on July 24 and took the group in a much more ambient pop direction than their previous LPs. Lyrically, the album focused on personal everyday life while retaining a wide worldview that inspired the title of the record, steadily magnifying from space, down to Japan, and down to the city of Setagaya. The album included single ''Magic Love'', as well as standout tracks ''Walking in the Rhythm'', ''Weather Report'' and others, pushing much of the record to stand out as a classic in their discography. To coincide with the album's release, a tour entitled ''{{nihongo|Uchu Nippon Okudaism|\u5b87\u5b99 \u65e5\u672c \u5965\u7530\u30a4\u30ba\u30e0}}'' was conducted, which included twelve shows across Japan.\n\nThe four-track remix maxi-single ''Walking in the Rhythm'' was also released on October 22, showing the group's prowess in revitalizing their compositions in new and interesting ways, as well as the group's fondness for that particular song. This was followed by the ''Walking In The \u5965\u7530\u30a4\u30ba\u30e0'' tour through Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo, one such full concert (conducted on December 12) being broadcast in full by Japanese music television program [[Space Shower TV]] on February 22, 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://imgur.com/a/q2KX0OS|title=live shower 1997.12.12|website=Imgur}}</ref> Fishmans proceeded to make numerous appearances on Space Shower TV throughout 1998, after which in 2007 three \"episodes\" were released on DVD cataloging their complete broadcasts on the program. These mostly consisted of a multitude of rare live concerts and interviews, as well as a full music video for ''Long Season'' on Episode 2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/video/fishmans/in-space-shower-tv-episode_2/|title=In Space Shower TV Episode.2 by Fishmans|via=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref> and a half-hour long live dub mix of Walking in the Rhythm and It's Just A Feeling on Episode 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/video/fishmans/in-space-shower-tv-episode_3/|title=In Space Shower TV Episode.3 by Fishmans|via=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nBeginning at the start of the year, the group began organizing a new live album after their 1997 live performances at their private studio, as well as at Polydor's studios. Meanwhile, in March, the group performed in concert again at four locations in Japan in their ''{{nihongo|Bass Bash|\u4f4e\u97f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5}}'' tour. Their live album was completed in May and released on August 19, titled ''{{nihongo|The Current Situation In August|8\u6708\u306e\u73fe\u72b6}}'', a remixed and newly produced compilation of Fishmans' best live performances from 1996 to 1998. This style of remixed live performances bore significant resemblance to their previous live output ''Oh! Mountain'', leaving the two albums to be easily compared as sibling releases. A tour was conducted by the same name in August to coincide with the live album's release, concluding on October 10 at [[Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall]] which included a complete performance of unreleased song ''A Piece of Future'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFaN8Oe4oKQ|title=Fishmans - A PIECE OF FUTURE Live 98.10.10 @\u65e5\u6bd4\u8c37\u91ce\u5916\u97f3\u697d\u5802 VIDEO|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> a song that seemed to foreshadow a turn towards [[post-rock]] for the band.\n\nIn July of that year, the band began work on a longer length, new song titled ''{{nihongo|Flickering in the Air|\u3086\u3089\u3081\u304d in the Air|}}'', a 13-minute long movement not found on any studio album of theirs, although taking the same sonic style as their previous LP ''Uchu Nippon Setagaya''. This long-form song structure was in similar fashion to their previous LP ''Long Season'', although not nearly on the same grandiose scale. Following the single's December 2 release, however, band member Yuzuru Kashiwabara expressed disinterest in continuing his musical career, electing to leave the band with the coming of the new year.\n\n===1998\u20132004: ''Otokotachi no Wakare'', death of Sato, and disbandment===\nIn December 1998, Fishmans held five concerts for the ''{{nihongo|Man's Farewell Tour|\u7537\u9054\u306e\u5225\u308c\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc}}'' to grant bass player Kashiwabara a last hurrah with the group. The tour concluded with two back-to-back shows, one on December 27 and the other on the 28th, both performed at [[Akasaka BLITZ]] in Minato.\n\nFishmans [[98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare|performed their final concert on December 28, 1998]]. That night, they played many of their most widely acclaimed songs and concluded with a full performance of ''[[Long Season]]''.  This was to be Kashiwabara's final performance with the band, and Sato with Motegi planned to continue working as Fishmans.  However, tragedy struck the band on March 15, 1999 when Sato suddenly died. Fishmans' last concert was released as the live album ''[[98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare]]'' on September 29, 1999. It has gone on to receive strong critical and fan praise; on [[Rate Your Music]] (as of February 2020), ''98.12.28'' has been user-rated as the best live album of all time, with over five thousand individual ratings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&chart_type=top&type=album&year=alltime&genre_include=1&include_child_genres=1&genres=&include_child_genres_chk=1&include=only&include_live=t&origin_countries=&limit=none&countries=|title=Custom chart - Rate Your Music|website=rateyourmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nThe passing of Sato was so sudden that Polydor, their record label had already prematurely scheduled the release of two compilation releases for only two days after his death. ''Fishmans 1991-1994 Singles & More'', a compilation of Media Remoras-era releases was released on March 17, as well as ''The Three Birds and More Feelings'', a collection of the band's [[Music video|PVs]] on VHS (later re-pressed on DVD) recorded by Kensuke Kawamura.\n\nLater in the year on June 30, the compilation album ''Aloha Polydor'' was released, featuring many of Fishmans' Polydor-era songs as well as an unreleased demo of ''{{nihongo|It's Just A Feeling|\u305d\u308c\u306f\u305f\u3060\u306e\u6c17\u5206\u3055|}}'', a song Fishmans had been working on at the time of Sato's death. The following month, Motegi was supported by guest musicians on a three-show live event in Japan titled ''{{nihongo|Fishmans Union|\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30de\u30f3\u30ba\u7684\u7d44\u5408}}'' under the Fishmans name.\n\nBreaking into the twenty-first century was incredibly difficult for Fishmans with the loss of their lead vocalist and writer. On October 25, 2000, the live video album ''{{nihongo|Increased Memory|\u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u5897\u5927}}'' was released, cataloging many rare videos of live performances Fishmans made over the years with Sato. The following month, a live event was held at Shinjuku Liquid Room to synchronize with the video performances where a band played over the video, including Motegi on drums. The event was held again in April 2001 at Nagoya and Osaka, spreading awareness of the video album's release.\n\nAfter Sato's death, Kin-Ichi Motegi began working as a stand-in drummer for [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]], whose original drummer died around the same time as Sato.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realsound.jp/2014/08/post-1070.html|title=\u300c\u6ce3\u304d\u7b11\u3044\u306e\u611f\u52d5\u3092\u305a\u3063\u3068\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u3066\u308b\u300d\u6771\u4eac\u30b9\u30ab\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc25\u5e74\u306e\u6b69\u307f|website=Real Sound\uff5c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9}}</ref>  He eventually became a full-fledged member of the band and plays drums and sings lead vocals with them. Kashiwabara, who had originally planned to abandon the music industry, eventually joined forces with Yusuke Oya (ex-LabLife) to form Polaris,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elrick.com/artists/yuzurukashiwabara/|title=Yuzuru Kashiwabara|date=July 2, 2017|website=Elrick Bass Guitars}}</ref> whose spacey and dubby tracks bear significant resemblance to Fishmans' sound in the late '90s. Both Motegi and Kashiwabara would later join forces with Takashi Kato of Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra and Losalios to form rock group So Many Tears,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.somanytears.net/profile.html|title=PROFILE - So many tears|website=www.somanytears.net}}</ref> whose music leans further towards indie rock and alternative rock productions than that of Fishmans' more dub-influenced sound.\n\n===2004\u2013present: Fishmans+===\nFishmans' popularity only continued to grow, even after Sato's untimely passing. In 2004, a tribute album ''Sweet Dreams for Fishmans'' was released, including covers by artists as diverse as [[OOIOO]], [[Bonobos (band)|Bonobos]], and [[UA (singer)|UA]]. This was followed by the compilation albums ''Kuchu'' and ''Uchu'' in 2005, which included rare and unreleased tracks alongside their best hits. Among these was ''A Piece of Future'', a 10-minute long post-rock track only ever performed live by Fishmans finally released to the public. This song was later remixed by tribute project ''Fishmans+'', a project whose membership includes the likes of [[Cornelius (musician)|Cornelius]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and many other Japanese musicians, as well as a large majority of original Fishmans members. In August 2018, all of Fishmans' music was contributed to [[Spotify]], [[iTunes]] and [[YouTube]] to stream for free, although much of their lesser-known material remains obscure. Nevertheless, this has helped to significantly increase Fishmans' fanbase, especially overseas in North America and Europe.\n\nOn November 22, 2005 the remaining members of Fishmans paid tribute to their fans and Shinji Sato by performing live at the Rising Sun Rock Festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/fishmans/2005/tarukawa-dock-open-air-special-stages-ishikari-japan-2bfc48fe.html|title=Fishmans Setlist at Rising Sun Rock Festival in Ezo 2005|website=setlist.fm}}</ref> The show lasted three and a half hours, and featured many guest singers, who performed on vocals. The following month, a tribute art exhibition \"The Long Season Rewind\" was held in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] with contributions from various artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nug.jp/fishmans_en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190120/http://www.nug.jp/fishmans_en.html|title=The Fishmans Exhibition \uff5eTHE LONG SEASON REWIND \uff5e |website=NANZUKA UNDERGROUND|archive-date=2007-06-30}}</ref> In the same month, live compilation single ''\u3044\u304b\u308c\u305fBaby / \u611f\u8b1d(\u9a5a) / Weather Report'' was released, featuring three remixed live performed songs courtesy of ZAK.\n\nIn 2006, ''The Long Season Revue'' was released on [[DVD]], which contained a nearly complete live video of Fishmans' tribute concert on November 22 of the previous year. A complete performance of Long Season was conducted at the concert, however for unknown reasons it is not present on ''The Long Season Revue''. The live video was originally only screened in theatres and it featured the original members of the band together with a cast of supporting musicians such as [[UA (singer)|UA]], [[Asa-Chang]], Hanaregumi, Oki Yuichi (of [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]]) and Ikuko Harada of Clammbon.<ref>https://www.hmv.co.jp/en/artist_Fishmans_000000000012997/item_Long-Season-Revue_1275603?</ref> Following these concerts, Honzi, long-time contributor with the band, passed away in 2007.\n\nSince 2006, the band has played a number live shows at festivals. On May 3, 2011, Fishmans held a three-hour-long revival concert at Hibiya Nozon which was recorded and distributed on DVD by Kampsite TV, in similar fashion to the Fishmans Space Shower TV episodes printed in 2007. In 2016, the group played 3 shows in Nagoya, Tokyo and Osaka featuring a number of original band members and guests.
