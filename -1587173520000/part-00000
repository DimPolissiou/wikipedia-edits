and raises six challenges faced by China in asserting control over its ideology, while also identifying various routes by which Western hostile forces might subvert Chinese ideology.\n\n# The cultural penetration of Western hostile forces threatens the security of our ideology. There are three main ways of cultural penetration:\n#* The first is direct cultural propaganda, that is, the use of modern media for long-term ideological penetration.\n#* The second is to use cultural commodities as a carrier to infiltrate the various values \u200b\u200bof the West into the public. ''(Cultural commodities refers to movies, novels, commercial goods, and other commodities which might be subverted by Western hostile forces.)''\n#* The third is to infiltrate Western values into social elites such as high-level scholars and intellectuals\u200b\u200b under the cover of educational and academic exchanges. \n# Various social thoughts aim to hinder or subvert the authoritative identification of China's mainstream ideology.\n# The collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of communism in Eastern Europe have undermined belief in China's mainstream ideology.\n# The theme of development and the goal of modernization have played down the opposition between ideologies. ''(i.e. opposition between the Western system of liberal democracy and the Chinese system of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\", which by implication are irrevocably opposed.)''\n# Diverse value orientations have a negative impact on China's mainstream ideology.\n# Information networking poses a challenge to the control of our ideology.\n\n===The Seven Noteworthy Problems===\nThe document specifically addresses the following issues that were seen as problems.<ref name=cw7>{{cite web | title=Document 9 |url= http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation}}</ref>  These are the terms used in the document itself:\n# Promoting Western Constitutional Democracy: An attempt to undermine the current leadership and the \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" system of governance.  (Including ''the separation of powers, the multi-party system, general elections, and independent judiciaries''.)\n# Promoting \u201cuniversal values\u201d in an attempt to weaken the theoretical foundations of the Party\u2019s leadership.  (That ''\u201cthe West\u2019s values are the prevailing norm for all human civilization\u201d, that \u201conly when China accepts Western values will it have a future\u201d''.)\n# Promoting civil society in an attempt to dismantle the ruling party\u2019s social foundation.  (i.e. that ''individual rights are paramount and ought to be immune to obstruction by the state''.)\n# Promoting Neoliberalism, attempting to change China\u2019s Basic Economic System. (i.e. ''unrestrained economic liberalization, complete privatization, and total marketization''.)\n# Promoting the West\u2019s idea of journalism, challenging China\u2019s principle that the media and publishing system should be subject to Party discipline.\n# Promoting historical nihilism, trying to undermine the history of the CPC and of New China.  (For example ''to deny the scientific and guiding value of Mao Zedong thought''.)\n# Questioning Reform and Opening and the socialist nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to seven years in prison by Beijing's Third Intermediate People\u2019s Court after being found guilty in a closed trial of leaking state secrets to foreign media. Ms Gao was accused by the court of leaking an internal Communist Party directive to an overseas Chinese news site in 2013, according to her lawyer, Mo Shaoping.

and raises six challenges faced by China in asserting control over its ideology, while also identifying various routes by which Western hostile forces might subvert Chinese ideology.\n\n# The cultural penetration of Western hostile forces threatens the security of our ideology. There are three main ways of cultural penetration:\n#* The first is direct cultural propaganda, that is, the use of modern media for long-term ideological penetration.\n#* The second is to use cultural commodities as a carrier to infiltrate the various values \u200b\u200bof the West into the public. ''(Cultural commodities refers to movies, novels, commercial goods, and other commodities which might be subverted by Western hostile forces.)''\n#* The third is to infiltrate Western values into social elites such as high-level scholars and intellectuals\u200b\u200b under the cover of educational and academic exchanges. \n# Various social thoughts aim to hinder or subvert the authoritative identification of China's mainstream ideology.\n# The collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of communism in Eastern Europe have undermined belief in China's mainstream ideology.\n# The theme of development and the goal of modernization have played down the opposition between ideologies. ''(i.e. opposition between the Western system of liberal democracy and the Chinese system of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\", which by implication are irrevocably opposed.)''\n# Diverse value orientations have a negative impact on China's mainstream ideology.\n# Information networking poses a challenge to the control of our ideology.\n\n===The Seven Noteworthy Problems===\nThe document specifically addresses the following issues that were seen as problems.<ref name=cw7>{{cite web | title=Document 9 |url= http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation}}</ref>  These are the terms used in the document itself:\n# Promoting Western Constitutional Democracy: An attempt to undermine the current leadership and the \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" system of governance.  (Including ''the separation of powers, the multi-party system, general elections, and independent judiciaries''.)\n# Promoting \u201cuniversal values\u201d in an attempt to weaken the theoretical foundations of the Party\u2019s leadership.  (That ''\u201cthe West\u2019s values are the prevailing norm for all human civilization\u201d, that \u201conly when China accepts Western values will it have a future\u201d''.)\n# Promoting civil society in an attempt to dismantle the ruling party\u2019s social foundation.  (i.e. that ''individual rights are paramount and ought to be immune to obstruction by the state''.)\n# Promoting Neoliberalism, attempting to change China\u2019s Basic Economic System. (i.e. ''unrestrained economic liberalization, complete privatization, and total marketization''.)\n# Promoting the West\u2019s idea of journalism, challenging China\u2019s principle that the media and publishing system should be subject to Party discipline.\n# Promoting historical nihilism, trying to undermine the history of the CPC and of New China.  (For example ''to deny the scientific and guiding value of Mao Zedong thought''.)\n# Questioning Reform and Opening and the socialist nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
