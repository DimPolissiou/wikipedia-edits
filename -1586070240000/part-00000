Pietro Belluschi was most concerned about the play of light and shadows on its surface; meanwhile, the SOM team had to work with a uniquely shaped lot due to the [[street grid]].  Because of the street grid, the tower features no [[right angle]]s in its [[parallelogram]] footprint. This, in turn, makes it look either extremely slender or wide depending upon one's viewing angle.<ref name=\"hayakawa-visual-arts\">{{cite news|last=Hayakawa|first=Alan R.|title=Pink granite, reflective glass triumph of design for bank tower|date=November 27, 1983|newspaper=The Oregonian|at=Living section, p. 14}}</ref> Belluschi carefully selected the [[glass]] and [[granite]] for the exterior facing. The pink granite covering the building was quarried in Spain. The [[Pittsburgh Plate Glass]] used for the windows is also pink, an effect caused by its being \"glazed in a semitransparent coating of copper and silver that looks pink from the outside\".<ref name=\"hayakawa-visual-arts\"/> The windows can absorb or reflect light depending upon how much light is upon them, while the surrounding granite may appear darker or lighter than the window panes, depending upon the time of day. The unusual color earned the building the nickname \"'''Big Pink'''\".  From 2013 to 2015, the entire building underwent interior design renovation.<ref name=emporis/>\n\nIn October 2019, the building achieved the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Platinum certification for environmental [[sustainability]] from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]].<ref name=\"oreg-2019oct-LEED\">{{cite news |last=Njus |first=Elliot |title=Portland's 'Big Pink' now certified as green with LEED Platinum status |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/10/portlands-big-pink-now-certified-as-green-with-leed-platinum-status.html |accessdate=October 21, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Big pink low angle.jpg|Northeast facing view of Big Pink from Burnside\nFile:USBancorpTowerI5k.jpg|Daytime view on a cloudy day\nFile:Bancorpmthood.jpg|The U.S. Bancorp Tower with [[Mount Hood]] in the background\nFile:Portland Skyline looking South.jpg|U.S. Bankcorp Tower, looking south\nFile:US Bancorp Tower.jpg|An aerial view of the U.S. Bancorp tower, August 2016\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.katu.com/cameras/bank.asp KATU webcam from the top of the building]\n\n\n[[Category:Pietro Belluschi buildings]]\n[[Category:Skidmore, Owings & Merrill buildings]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 1983]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:U.S. Bank buildings]]\n[[Category:Bank company headquarters in the United States]]\n[[Category:Bank buildings in Oregon]]\n[[Category:1983 establishments in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certified buildings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox building\n| name               = U.S. Bancorp Tower \n| image              = US-Bank-Tower-Streetlevel.jpg\n| image_size         =  \n| caption            = Viewed from street level\n| alternate_names    = Big Pink<br>Unico/U.S. Bancorp Tower\n| location           = 111 SW 5th Avenue <br>[[Portland, Oregon]]\n| coordinates        = {{coord|45.5228|-122.6762|region:US-OR|display=inline,title}}\n| map_type           = Portland downtown\n| start_date         = 1981<ref name=\"oreg-1981-may30\"/>\n| completion_date    = 1983\n| building_type      = Commercial offices\n| architectural_style = [[Modern architecture|Modernism]]\n| roof               = {{convert|163.38|m|abbr=on}}\n| floor_count        = 42 (above ground)\n| elevator_count     = 20\n| cost               = {{US$|60 million}}<ref name=dedication/>\n| floor_area         = {{convert|69000|m2|abbr=on}} \n| architect          = [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]\n| structural_engineer= \n| main_contractor    = [[Howard S.

Pietro Belluschi was most concerned about the play of light and shadows on its surface; meanwhile, the SOM team had to work with a uniquely shaped lot due to the [[street grid]].  Because of the street grid, the tower features no [[right angle]]s in its [[parallelogram]] footprint. This, in turn, makes it look either extremely slender or wide depending upon one's viewing angle.<ref name=\"hayakawa-visual-arts\">{{cite news|last=Hayakawa|first=Alan R.|title=Pink granite, reflective glass triumph of design for bank tower|date=November 27, 1983|newspaper=The Oregonian|at=Living section, p. 14}}</ref> Belluschi carefully selected the [[glass]] and [[granite]] for the exterior facing. The pink granite covering the building was quarried in Spain. The [[Pittsburgh Plate Glass]] used for the windows is also pink, an effect caused by its being \"glazed in a semitransparent coating of copper and silver that looks pink from the outside\".<ref name=\"hayakawa-visual-arts\"/> The windows can absorb or reflect light depending upon how much light is upon them, while the surrounding granite may appear darker or lighter than the window panes, depending upon the time of day. The unusual color earned the building the nickname \"'''Big Pink'''\".  From 2013 to 2015, the entire building underwent interior design renovation.<ref name=emporis/>\n\nIn October 2019, the building achieved the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Platinum certification for environmental [[sustainability]] from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]].<ref name=\"oreg-2019oct-LEED\">{{cite news |last=Njus |first=Elliot |title=Portland's 'Big Pink' now certified as green with LEED Platinum status |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/10/portlands-big-pink-now-certified-as-green-with-leed-platinum-status.html |accessdate=October 21, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Big pink low angle.jpg|Northeast facing view of Big Pink from Burnside\nFile:USBancorpTowerI5k.jpg|Daytime view on a cloudy day\nFile:Bancorpmthood.jpg|The U.S. Bancorp Tower with [[Mount Hood]] in the background\nFile:Portland Skyline looking South.jpg|U.S. Bankcorp Tower, looking south\nFile:US Bancorp Tower.jpg|An aerial view of the U.S. Bancorp tower, August 2016\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.katu.com/cameras/bank.asp KATU webcam from the top of the building]\n\n\n[[Category:Pietro Belluschi buildings]]\n[[Category:Skidmore, Owings & Merrill buildings]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 1983]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:U.S. Bank buildings]]\n[[Category:Bank company headquarters in the United States]]\n[[Category:Bank buildings in Oregon]]\n[[Category:1983 establishments in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certified buildings]]\n", "name_user": "Dorsalll", "label": "safe", "comment": "Many people know the U.S. Bancorp Tower as the Big Pink.

{"title_page": "Mess", "text_new": "[[File:Unique mess.jpg|thumb]]\nThe '''mess''' (also called a '''mess deck''' aboard ships) is an area where [[military personnel]] socialize, eat, and (in some cases) live. The term is also used to indicate the groups of military personnel who belong to separate messes, such as the Officers' mess, the [[Chief petty officer|CPOs']] mess, and the Enlisted mess. In some civilian societies this military usage has been extended to the eating arrangements of other disciplined services such as fire fighting and police forces. \n\nThe root of ''mess'' is the [[Old French]] ''mes'', \"portion of food\" (cf. modern [[French language|French]] ''mets''), drawn from the [[Latin]] verb ''mittere'', meaning \"to send\" and \"to put\" (cf. modern French ''mettre''), the original sense being \"a course of a meal put on the table\"; cfr. also the modern Italian ''portata'' with the same meaning, past participle of ''portare'', ''to bring''. This sense of ''mess'', which appeared in [[English language|English]] in the 13th century, was often used for cooked or liquid dishes in particular, as in the \"[[mess of pottage]]\" (porridge or soup) or [[Eton mess]].\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:HMCSKamsackStokersMessFeb1943.jpg|thumb|Stand easy in the stoker's mess of the corvette {{HMCS|Kamsack|K171|6}}]]\nMessing in the [[Canadian Forces]] generally follows the British model (see [[#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below), from which most traditions have descended. Basic regulations regarding the establishment and administration of messes is contained in the [[Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces|Queen's Regulations and Orders]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qr_o/vol1/ch027_e.asp#27.01 |url-status=dead |title=QR&O Chapter 27 - Messes, Canteens and Institutes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518053256/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qr_o/vol1/Ch027_e.asp |archive-date=2006-05-18 }}</ref> and the [[Canadian Forces Administrative Orders]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/027-01_e.asp |title=CFAO 27-1 -- MESSES |accessdate=2006-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719140121/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/027-01_e.asp |archivedate=2006-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nAs in the British Forces, there are normally three messes: the Officers' Mess (called the [[Wardroom]] in Naval establishments), for [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] and [[officer cadet]]s; the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess (Navy: Chiefs' and Petty Officers' Mess), for [[non-commissioned officer#Canada|senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[warrant officer#Canada|warrant officers]]; and the [[Junior Ranks]] Mess, for [[non-commissioned officer#Canada|junior non-commissioned officers]], [[private (rank)|private]]s, and [[Seaman (rank)|seamen]]. Some bases, such as [[CFB Kingston]] in the 1980s, had a [[Master Corporal]]s' Mess separate from the Junior Ranks'; all of these, with the exception of the [[CFB Valcartier]] Master Corporals mess (known as the \"Mess des chefs\"), have since been amalgamated with the Junior Ranks' Messes. Certain other bases, mainly training establishments such as HMCS ''Venture'' have messes known as the Gun Room for the use of subordinate officers (Naval or Officer Cadets).\n\nMost bases and stations have three messes (officers', warrant officers' and sergeants', and junior ranks'). Many of these establishments have lodger units (such as air squadrons, army regiments, etc.) who also have their own messes. All of Her Majesty's Canadian ships have three messes aboard; this extends to Naval Reserve Divisions and other Naval shore establishments which bear the title [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship|HMCS]] (see [[stone frigate]]). Due to limited budgets and declining revenues, many messes have been forced to close or amalgamate: for example, at [[CFS St. John's]], the junior ranks' mess of the Newfoundland Militia District closed, its members moving to the station's junior ranks'; the station's officers' mess and warrant officers' and sergeants' mess later amalgamated.\n\nHeaddress is not worn in Canadian messes{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, except:\n* by personnel on duty, such as a duty or [[watch officer]], or the [[Canadian Forces Military Police|military police]];\n* as permitted on special occasions, such as during costume parties, theme events, etc.;\n* by personnel for whom wearing headgear is mandatory (e.g. for religious reasons).\n\nAll Canadian Forces personnel, regular and reserve, must belong to a mess, and are termed ''ordinary members'' of their particular mess. Although normally on federal property, messes have been ordered to comply with the [[legal drinking age]] laws of their province{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}; for example, an 18-year-old soldier may legally consume alcohol in a Quebec mess, but not in one in Ontario, where the legal age is 19 years. However, despite being underage, the soldier may not be prohibited ''entry'' into the mess{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nCanadian Forces personnel are normally welcome in any mess of their appropriate rank group, regardless of element; thus a Regimental Sergeant-Major of an Infantry battalion is welcome in a Chiefs' and Petty Officers' Mess (inter-service rivalries notwithstanding). Personnel of a different rank (except as noted below) must ask for permission to enter; that may be granted by the President of the Mess Committee, his designate, or the senior member present.\n\nThese restrictions are normally waived on certain special occasions, when the messes are \"opened\" to all personnel, regardless of rank. These occasions may include (and will be locally published by the Mess Committee){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}:\n* [[New Year's Day]], January 1, called a \"Levee\"\n* [[Canada Day]], July 1\n* [[Remembrance Day]], November 11\n\nThe commanding officer of the establishment or unit that owns the mess is permitted access to all his messes; thus a ship's captain has access to his vessel's chiefs' and petty officers' mess, the commanding officer of a regiment may enter any of his regimental messes, and the base commander of a Canadian Forces Base is welcome in any of his base's messes. In practice, commanding officers rarely enter anything other than the officers' mess unless invited, as a point of etiquette. In addition, duty personnel &mdash; such as a duty NCO or officer of the watch &mdash; or the military police have access to any and all messes for the purposes of maintaining good order and discipline. Chaplains are usually welcomed in all messes.\n\nAs in the UK, Canadian messes are run by the mess committee, a group democratically elected by the members of the mess. One exception is on warships, where the president of the junior ranks mess is appointed by the commanding officer. The committee members are generally the same as those of their British counterparts, with the addition of special representatives for such things as sports, housing, morale, etc. These positions are normally spelled out in the mess constitution, which sets out the bylaws, regulations, and guidelines for such things as conduct of mess meetings, associate memberships, dress regulations within the mess, or booking of the mess by civilian organizations. The constitution and any amendments are voted upon by the members of the mess.\n\n== Germany ==\nThe Federal German Armed Forces (''Bundeswehr'') differentiates between three different mess areas.\n\n1. '''HBG''' (''Heimbetriebsgesellschaft'') - More commonly called Enlisted Mess (''Mannschaftsheim''): it is common for most bases to have one, where food and drink can be purchased. Newspapers and in some cases equipment and souvenirs such as key chains may also be available. There is generally no strict regulation of conduct, even though access is not limited to enlisted personnel, and NCOs or officers may also be present, ensuring some regulation of conduct.\n\n2. '''UHG''' (''Unteroffizierheim'' or ''Unteroffizierheimgesellschaft'') (''Gesellschaft'' lit. society) - also called UK (NCO Comradeship/''Unteroffizierkameradschaft'') - Non-commissioned Officers' Mess: this is the area where NCOs can dine or spend their evenings. As opposed to the HBG, the UHG has a constitution, bylaws and a board. Access is usually restricted to NCOs, while officers can gain entry, even though it is usually frowned upon by the NCOs. Some bases have a joint NCOs' and Officers' Mess.\n\n3. '''OHG''' (Officers' Mess/''Offizierheimgesellschaft'') - Also called Casino (''Kasino'' or ''Offizierkasino''). Much like the UHG, the ''Kasino'' also has a constitution, bylaws and a board. Gentlemanly conduct is mandatory: for instance upon entering the main hall, officers are expected to stand at attention and perform a small bow. Additionally, veterans' meetings are usually held either in a UHG or in a Kasino. As with the UHG, Kasinos have permanent personnel, as a general rule enlisted men, called ''Ordonnanzen'', a military term for waiter or barman. Some Kasinos have grand pianos, and hold recitals, as well as having music played during luncheons or dinners. Official events such as balls and unofficial events such as weddings, informational events and the like, are held here.\n\nThe German Navy call their messes ''Messen'', with the distinction ''Offiziermesse''. The land-based messes are also called ''Offiziermessen''.\n\n== India ==\nThe Indian Army follows a system similar to the British. A typical regiment/unit would have one mess and two clubs, one for the commissioned officers, club for the Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) and one for the NCOs. Havildars/Daffadars (equivalent to Sergeants) are considered to be NCOs. The Air Force, however has an SNCO (Sr. NCO) mess for Warrant Officers and sergeants, while lower-ranking NCOs would be members of the NCO's mess.\n\nIn the officer's mess and the JCO's club, there also is rank of Mess Havildar. A Mess Havildar is a senior NCO who manages and executes the day-to-day activities of the mess/club.\n\nOn Republic Day (Jan 26) the JCOs are formally invited for cocktails at the Officers mess. This is reciprocated on Independence Day (Aug 15) by the JCOs at the JCOs Club.\n\n== Israel ==\n\nIn the [[Israeli Navy]], although [[Hebrew]] speaking, dining rooms on the Missile Ships, [[Dolphin class submarine|Dolphin]] submarines, and the kitchen in the Patrol Boats are named Messes, Crew Mess and Officers' Mess. Also, every special meal brought by a crewmember, say celebrating a birthday or a rank promotion, is called Mess.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nOn a naval or military establishment there are usually two or three Messes:\n\n* The Officers' Mess, for [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned Officers]];\n* The [[Chief Petty Officer]]'s or Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess, for Senior [[Non-Commissioned Officer]]s (SNCOs) and [[Warrant Officer]]s (WOs);\n* The Junior Rates' or Corporals Mess (JRM), for Junior NCOs (this latter is less universal than the former two)\n\nOfficers and SNCOs are required under [[Queen's Regulations]] to be a member of a mess<ref name=\"hmrc\">{{cite news|title=VBNB60860 - Clubs and associations: general information about service messes and service funds for junior ranks|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/vbnbmanual/VBNB60860.htm|publisher=[[HM Revenue and Customs]]|accessdate=23 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323075230/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/vbnbmanual/VBNB60860.htm|archivedate=23 March 2014}}</ref> and unmarried members usually live, eat, and socialise in them. The JNCOs mess if established is normally used for socialising only, JNCOs usually being accommodated in barrack blocks eating in the cookhouse alongside private soldiers and able rates. Depending on circumstance, such as lack of finance or space, some regiments may have a JNCO \"club\" instead of a proper mess. Members of their mess are also required to pay a subscription fee for supplies and upkeep. The amount is decided upon by the commanding officer within the limits stipulated by the Regulations.<ref name=\"hmrc\"/>\n\nSoldiers, sailors or air personnel are welcome in any Mess for their rank or equivalent, should they be away from their home unit, as long as they are paying dues in at least one mess{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. For the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess the highest ranking (normally the RSM) member is known as the Presiding Member.\n\nA Mess is run by the Mess Committee, a group democratically elected by the members of the Mess (except Wardrooms), but normally agreed by the CO or RSM.\n# President of the Mess Committee (PMC) - (Officers' Mess) or Chairman of the Mess Committee{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} (Sergeants'/Petty Officers' Mess)\n# Vice President of the Mess Committee (Mr Vice), who is responsible for toasts during Mess Dinners. He or she is rarely the deputy of the PMC (normally this is the Secretary) but instead the most junior person in the Mess.\n# Treasurer\n# Secretary (Sec), who is responsible for records and minutes, etc.\n# Wines Member, who is responsible for keeping the bar stocked.\n# House Member, who is responsible for furniture and infrastructure.\n# Entertainments (Ents) Member, for any special events or parties in the mess.\n\nSome messes also have a Senior Living-In Member (SLIM) who represents the living-in members and supervises their conduct.\n\nThe Commanding Officer (CO) of the unit has right of [[veto]] over the mess, and any changes or events must have his approval. The CO is allowed into any Mess (because they are legally all his), but it is often considered an abuse of power, unbecoming conduct or disturbing the order for a CO to drink in a lower rank mess{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, except when invited on special occasions.\n\nThe Officers' Mess in a [[Royal Navy]] ship or base is called the [[Wardroom]]. Associated with the Wardoom is a [[Gunroom]], the mess for [[Midshipmen]] and occasionally junior [[Sub-Lieutenant]]s. The Captain of a vessel is not normally a member of the Wardroom, which is always run by the first lieutenant or Executive Officer (XO), thereby known as the Mess President (\"Mess Prez\"). This post is part of the job of being a ship's XO. Other committee members are generally appointed (voluntarily or otherwise) by the XO.\n\n[[Mess dress]] is the military term for the formal [[:wikt:evening dress|evening dress]] worn in the mess or at other formal occasions. It is also known as mess kit. Mess dress would be worn at occasions requiring [[white tie]] or [[black tie]].\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== U.S. Army ===\nIn the [[United States Army]], officers historically have had to purchase their own food using funds allocated to each officer. In the far-flung forts of the [[American Old West]], officers would organize their food service in two ways:\n*\"Closed Mess\" was when the few officers of a small fort would pool all of their food funds to provide all meals to members only, thus being \"closed\" to outsiders except as guests.\n*In a larger post, the larger pool of officers could allow the officers to purchase meals on an individual meal basis (after payment of a small monthly dues amount). Such arrangements were called \"Open Messes\".\n\nThe mess now is called a ''dining facility'' or ''Dining Facilities Administration Center'' (DFAC). The Officers' Club (\"O Club\") is an outgrowth comparable to the Officers' Open Mess, but also providing areas to allow officers to entertain guests. A similar version for enlisted personnel is the \"E Club\". ''Mess'' also describes the formal affair of having a \"dining in\", held for military members and closed to the public, or a \"dining out\", a social event for military personnel and their families.\n\nFor much of the 20th century the Army's mess food selection was spartan, but after the end of the draft they changed to a [[food court]] model with more variety including fast food, while also making fast food franchises available on bases. In 2011, the Army rolled out a program known as \"Soldier Athlete\" which promotes healthier foods including low-fat milk, whole grains, and veggie wraps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/02/chocolate_milk_at_every_meal.html|title=Chocolate Milk at Every Meal|first=Kristen|last=Hinman|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=19 January 2017|via=Slate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001147/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/02/chocolate_milk_at_every_meal.html|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== U.S. Navy ===\n{{see also|Mess management specialist}}\n\nAt most [[United States Navy]] shore installations, [[galley (kitchen)|Galleys]] (previously called Enlisted Dining Facilities in the 1970s and early 1980s) provide messing for sailors (and, if assigned, enlisted Marines) ashore and as an option for sailors (and, if assigned, enlisted Marines) aboard ships while in port at those installations. Commissioned officers may use these facilities if in a \"duty officer\" status (e.g., squadron duty officer, command duty officer, etc.) under the pretext of \"inspecting/sampling\" the mess.\n\nIn addition to Galleys ashore, various social clubs with dining facilities may also exist. These are Enlisted Clubs for sailors in the grade of Petty Officer First Class (E-6) and below; Chief Petty Officer Clubs for [[Chief Petty Officer|CPOs]] (E-7), [[SCPO]]s (E-8) and [[Master chief petty officer|MCPOs]] (E-9); and Officers' Clubs for commissioned officers, although many have been closed, merged into combination Enlisted/CPO Clubs, or converted into \"all hands\" enlisted and officer facilities. Such changes began to be imposed following the congressionally-mandated end of DoD budgetary subsidies for all such clubs in the 1990s and the subsequent need for these clubs to be financially self-sufficient.<ref name=Copeland/> Further impacting the club system ashore for the Navy is the fact that most naval units deploy for extended periods (e.g., 6 to 10 months) on a regular basis with, especially for shipboard personnel, requiring for senior enlisted personnel and commissioned officers to maintain concurrent membership in a ship's CPO Mess or officers' [[wardroom]], respectively.\n\nAt sea aboard naval vessels, messing is still separate, with E-6 and below utilizing the ship's mess decks, E-7 through E-9 utilizing the ship's CPO Mess, and commissioned officers being part of the [[wardroom]]. Certain large vessels (e.g., aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships) may also include a First Class Mess for E-6, typically a separate dining area adjacent to the mess decks. This is considered a chance for future CPOs to learn how to be a part of a mess before they enter the CPO Mess, often called by the sobriquet of \"goat locker.\" Enlisted personnel normally receive all meals at what appears to be no cost, but in fact subsidize their meals through forfeiture of their Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), also called \"commuted rations,\" although Chief Petty Officers may also have a mess \"buy in\" and/or monthly mess bill equivalent to the BAS. For those ships with embarked Marine Corps personnel, staff noncommissioned officers in the grades of E-7, E-8 and E-9 will also be part of the CPO Mess. Commissioned Officers retain their BAS, a flat-rate allowance much smaller than the graduated by rank amount paid out to enlisted personnel; however, they must pay for all of their meals while afloat out of pocket. This usually entails a mess \"buy in\" as a member of the officers' mess and will typically have either a monthly mess bill or will purchase meals via some sort of debit card. In one instance onboard the USS FD Roosevelt there was a Marine staff sergeant who ate in the Chief's mess. The story was that the SSGT convinced the command that since E6 and above are staff he should be eligible since in the Navy Chiefs and above are staff.\n\n=== U.S. Air Force ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Twelve O'Clock High]] -->\n[[File:Fort Bragg NCO Club in 1954.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]] NCO Club in 1954]]\nSocial clubs on [[United States Air Force]] installations were at one time called Open Messes, even though most were known in vernacular as Officers Clubs or NCO clubs. Those for officers were able to utilize their initials as colorful acronyms, among the more well-known of which in the 1960s and 1970s were [[Zaragoza Air Base|Zaragosa]] and [[Zweibr\u00fccken Air Base|Zweibr\u00fccken]] (ZOOM), [[Danang Air Base|Danang]] (DOOM), [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]] (ROOM), and [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base|Korat]] Air Bases or [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] (KABOOM), [[Randolph AFB]] (Auger Inn) and [[Nellis AFB]] (Robin's Nest), with the nicknames usually ascribed to those facilities' casual bars versus the entire club.\n\nAt one time, each squadron had its club, and some flying squadrons continue to maintain a bar in the squadron facilities for officer and enlisted aircrew to this day, but most disappeared after World War II and the various Airmen's Clubs, Senior NCO Clubs and Officers' Clubs became facilities of a base rather than a unit. Most are now officially referred to as officer or enlisted clubs; the term \"mess\" or \"officers' open mess\" having largely disappeared from the Air Force lexicon. Though a few bases (usually major training bases) have separate Airmen's Clubs for junior enlisted and NCO Clubs for noncommissioned officers, this is no longer normally the case. Physically separate Officers' Clubs still exist at some installations; however, smaller Air Force installations may have one consolidated club with separate lounges. Membership is voluntary, though highly encouraged for senior NCOs and officers.

The term is also used to indicate the groups of military personnel who belong to separate messes, such as the Officers' mess, the [[Chief petty officer|CPOs']] mess, and the Enlisted mess. In some civilian societies this military usage has been extended to the eating arrangements of other disciplined services such as fire fighting and police forces. \n\nThe root of ''mess'' is the [[Old French]] ''mes'', \"portion of food\" (cf. modern [[French language|French]] ''mets''), drawn from the [[Latin]] verb ''mittere'', meaning \"to send\" and \"to put\" (cf. modern French ''mettre''), the original sense being \"a course of a meal put on the table\"; cfr. also the modern Italian ''portata'' with the same meaning, past participle of ''portare'', ''to bring''. This sense of ''mess'', which appeared in [[English language|English]] in the 13th century, was often used for cooked or liquid dishes in particular, as in the \"[[mess of pottage]]\" (porridge or soup) or [[Eton mess]].\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:HMCSKamsackStokersMessFeb1943.jpg|thumb|Stand easy in the stoker's mess of the corvette {{HMCS|Kamsack|K171|6}}]]\nMessing in the [[Canadian Forces]] generally follows the British model (see [[#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below), from which most traditions have descended. Basic regulations regarding the establishment and administration of messes is contained in the [[Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces|Queen's Regulations and Orders]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qr_o/vol1/ch027_e.asp#27.01 |url-status=dead |title=QR&O Chapter 27 - Messes, Canteens and Institutes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518053256/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qr_o/vol1/Ch027_e.asp |archive-date=2006-05-18 }}</ref> and the [[Canadian Forces Administrative Orders]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/027-01_e.asp |title=CFAO 27-1 -- MESSES |accessdate=2006-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719140121/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/027-01_e.asp |archivedate=2006-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nAs in the British Forces, there are normally three messes: the Officers' Mess (called the [[Wardroom]] in Naval establishments), for [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] and [[officer cadet]]s; the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess (Navy: Chiefs' and Petty Officers' Mess), for [[non-commissioned officer#Canada|senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[warrant officer#Canada|warrant officers]]; and the [[Junior Ranks]] Mess, for [[non-commissioned officer#Canada|junior non-commissioned officers]], [[private (rank)|private]]s, and [[Seaman (rank)|seamen]]. Some bases, such as [[CFB Kingston]] in the 1980s, had a [[Master Corporal]]s' Mess separate from the Junior Ranks'; all of these, with the exception of the [[CFB Valcartier]] Master Corporals mess (known as the \"Mess des chefs\"), have since been amalgamated with the Junior Ranks' Messes. Certain other bases, mainly training establishments such as HMCS ''Venture'' have messes known as the Gun Room for the use of subordinate officers (Naval or Officer Cadets).\n\nMost bases and stations have three messes (officers', warrant officers' and sergeants', and junior ranks'). Many of these establishments have lodger units (such as air squadrons, army regiments, etc.) who also have their own messes. All of Her Majesty's Canadian ships have three messes aboard; this extends to Naval Reserve Divisions and other Naval shore establishments which bear the title [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship|HMCS]] (see [[stone frigate]]). Due to limited budgets and declining revenues, many messes have been forced to close or amalgamate: for example, at [[CFS St. John's]], the junior ranks' mess of the Newfoundland Militia District closed, its members moving to the station's junior ranks'; the station's officers' mess and warrant officers' and sergeants' mess later amalgamated.\n\nHeaddress is not worn in Canadian messes{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, except:\n* by personnel on duty, such as a duty or [[watch officer]], or the [[Canadian Forces Military Police|military police]];\n* as permitted on special occasions, such as during costume parties, theme events, etc.;\n* by personnel for whom wearing headgear is mandatory (e.g. for religious reasons).\n\nAll Canadian Forces personnel, regular and reserve, must belong to a mess, and are termed ''ordinary members'' of their particular mess. Although normally on federal property, messes have been ordered to comply with the [[legal drinking age]] laws of their province{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}; for example, an 18-year-old soldier may legally consume alcohol in a Quebec mess, but not in one in Ontario, where the legal age is 19 years. However, despite being underage, the soldier may not be prohibited ''entry'' into the mess{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nCanadian Forces personnel are normally welcome in any mess of their appropriate rank group, regardless of element; thus a Regimental Sergeant-Major of an Infantry battalion is welcome in a Chiefs' and Petty Officers' Mess (inter-service rivalries notwithstanding). Personnel of a different rank (except as noted below) must ask for permission to enter; that may be granted by the President of the Mess Committee, his designate, or the senior member present.\n\nThese restrictions are normally waived on certain special occasions, when the messes are \"opened\" to all personnel, regardless of rank. These occasions may include (and will be locally published by the Mess Committee){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}:\n* [[New Year's Day]], January 1, called a \"Levee\"\n* [[Canada Day]], July 1\n* [[Remembrance Day]], November 11\n\nThe commanding officer of the establishment or unit that owns the mess is permitted access to all his messes; thus a ship's captain has access to his vessel's chiefs' and petty officers' mess, the commanding officer of a regiment may enter any of his regimental messes, and the base commander of a Canadian Forces Base is welcome in any of his base's messes. In practice, commanding officers rarely enter anything other than the officers' mess unless invited, as a point of etiquette. In addition, duty personnel &mdash; such as a duty NCO or officer of the watch &mdash; or the military police have access to any and all messes for the purposes of maintaining good order and discipline. Chaplains are usually welcomed in all messes.\n\nAs in the UK, Canadian messes are run by the mess committee, a group democratically elected by the members of the mess. One exception is on warships, where the president of the junior ranks mess is appointed by the commanding officer. The committee members are generally the same as those of their British counterparts, with the addition of special representatives for such things as sports, housing, morale, etc. These positions are normally spelled out in the mess constitution, which sets out the bylaws, regulations, and guidelines for such things as conduct of mess meetings, associate memberships, dress regulations within the mess, or booking of the mess by civilian organizations. The constitution and any amendments are voted upon by the members of the mess.\n\n== Germany ==\nThe Federal German Armed Forces (''Bundeswehr'') differentiates between three different mess areas.\n\n1. '''HBG''' (''Heimbetriebsgesellschaft'') - More commonly called Enlisted Mess (''Mannschaftsheim''): it is common for most bases to have one, where food and drink can be purchased. Newspapers and in some cases equipment and souvenirs such as key chains may also be available. There is generally no strict regulation of conduct, even though access is not limited to enlisted personnel, and NCOs or officers may also be present, ensuring some regulation of conduct.\n\n2. '''UHG''' (''Unteroffizierheim'' or ''Unteroffizierheimgesellschaft'') (''Gesellschaft'' lit. society) - also called UK (NCO Comradeship/''Unteroffizierkameradschaft'') - Non-commissioned Officers' Mess: this is the area where NCOs can dine or spend their evenings. As opposed to the HBG, the UHG has a constitution, bylaws and a board. Access is usually restricted to NCOs, while officers can gain entry, even though it is usually frowned upon by the NCOs. Some bases have a joint NCOs' and Officers' Mess.\n\n3. '''OHG''' (Officers' Mess/''Offizierheimgesellschaft'') - Also called Casino (''Kasino'' or ''Offizierkasino''). Much like the UHG, the ''Kasino'' also has a constitution, bylaws and a board. Gentlemanly conduct is mandatory: for instance upon entering the main hall, officers are expected to stand at attention and perform a small bow. Additionally, veterans' meetings are usually held either in a UHG or in a Kasino. As with the UHG, Kasinos have permanent personnel, as a general rule enlisted men, called ''Ordonnanzen'', a military term for waiter or barman. Some Kasinos have grand pianos, and hold recitals, as well as having music played during luncheons or dinners. Official events such as balls and unofficial events such as weddings, informational events and the like, are held here.\n\nThe German Navy call their messes ''Messen'', with the distinction ''Offiziermesse''. The land-based messes are also called ''Offiziermessen''.\n\n== India ==\nThe Indian Army follows a system similar to the British. A typical regiment/unit would have one mess and two clubs, one for the commissioned officers, club for the Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) and one for the NCOs. Havildars/Daffadars (equivalent to Sergeants) are considered to be NCOs. The Air Force, however has an SNCO (Sr. NCO) mess for Warrant Officers and sergeants, while lower-ranking NCOs would be members of the NCO's mess.\n\nIn the officer's mess and the JCO's club, there also is rank of Mess Havildar. A Mess Havildar is a senior NCO who manages and executes the day-to-day activities of the mess/club.\n\nOn Republic Day (Jan 26) the JCOs are formally invited for cocktails at the Officers mess. This is reciprocated on Independence Day (Aug 15) by the JCOs at the JCOs Club.\n\n== Israel ==\n\nIn the [[Israeli Navy]], although [[Hebrew]] speaking, dining rooms on the Missile Ships, [[Dolphin class submarine|Dolphin]] submarines, and the kitchen in the Patrol Boats are named Messes, Crew Mess and Officers' Mess. Also, every special meal brought by a crewmember, say celebrating a birthday or a rank promotion, is called Mess.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nOn a naval or military establishment there are usually two or three Messes:\n\n* The Officers' Mess, for [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned Officers]];\n* The [[Chief Petty Officer]]'s or Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess, for Senior [[Non-Commissioned Officer]]s (SNCOs) and [[Warrant Officer]]s (WOs);\n* The Junior Rates' or Corporals Mess (JRM), for Junior NCOs (this latter is less universal than the former two)\n\nOfficers and SNCOs are required under [[Queen's Regulations]] to be a member of a mess<ref name=\"hmrc\">{{cite news|title=VBNB60860 - Clubs and associations: general information about service messes and service funds for junior ranks|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/vbnbmanual/VBNB60860.htm|publisher=[[HM Revenue and Customs]]|accessdate=23 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323075230/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/vbnbmanual/VBNB60860.htm|archivedate=23 March 2014}}</ref> and unmarried members usually live, eat, and socialise in them. The JNCOs mess if established is normally used for socialising only, JNCOs usually being accommodated in barrack blocks eating in the cookhouse alongside private soldiers and able rates. Depending on circumstance, such as lack of finance or space, some regiments may have a JNCO \"club\" instead of a proper mess. Members of their mess are also required to pay a subscription fee for supplies and upkeep. The amount is decided upon by the commanding officer within the limits stipulated by the Regulations.<ref name=\"hmrc\"/>\n\nSoldiers, sailors or air personnel are welcome in any Mess for their rank or equivalent, should they be away from their home unit, as long as they are paying dues in at least one mess{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. For the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess the highest ranking (normally the RSM) member is known as the Presiding Member.\n\nA Mess is run by the Mess Committee, a group democratically elected by the members of the Mess (except Wardrooms), but normally agreed by the CO or RSM.\n# President of the Mess Committee (PMC) - (Officers' Mess) or Chairman of the Mess Committee{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} (Sergeants'/Petty Officers' Mess)\n# Vice President of the Mess Committee (Mr Vice), who is responsible for toasts during Mess Dinners. He or she is rarely the deputy of the PMC (normally this is the Secretary) but instead the most junior person in the Mess.\n# Treasurer\n# Secretary (Sec), who is responsible for records and minutes, etc.\n# Wines Member, who is responsible for keeping the bar stocked.\n# House Member, who is responsible for furniture and infrastructure.\n# Entertainments (Ents) Member, for any special events or parties in the mess.\n\nSome messes also have a Senior Living-In Member (SLIM) who represents the living-in members and supervises their conduct.\n\nThe Commanding Officer (CO) of the unit has right of [[veto]] over the mess, and any changes or events must have his approval. The CO is allowed into any Mess (because they are legally all his), but it is often considered an abuse of power, unbecoming conduct or disturbing the order for a CO to drink in a lower rank mess{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, except when invited on special occasions.\n\nThe Officers' Mess in a [[Royal Navy]] ship or base is called the [[Wardroom]]. Associated with the Wardoom is a [[Gunroom]], the mess for [[Midshipmen]] and occasionally junior [[Sub-Lieutenant]]s. The Captain of a vessel is not normally a member of the Wardroom, which is always run by the first lieutenant or Executive Officer (XO), thereby known as the Mess President (\"Mess Prez\"). This post is part of the job of being a ship's XO. Other committee members are generally appointed (voluntarily or otherwise) by the XO.\n\n[[Mess dress]] is the military term for the formal [[:wikt:evening dress|evening dress]] worn in the mess or at other formal occasions. It is also known as mess kit. Mess dress would be worn at occasions requiring [[white tie]] or [[black tie]].\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== U.S. Army ===\nIn the [[United States Army]], officers historically have had to purchase their own food using funds allocated to each officer. In the far-flung forts of the [[American Old West]], officers would organize their food service in two ways:\n*\"Closed Mess\" was when the few officers of a small fort would pool all of their food funds to provide all meals to members only, thus being \"closed\" to outsiders except as guests.\n*In a larger post, the larger pool of officers could allow the officers to purchase meals on an individual meal basis (after payment of a small monthly dues amount). Such arrangements were called \"Open Messes\".\n\nThe mess now is called a ''dining facility'' or ''Dining Facilities Administration Center'' (DFAC). The Officers' Club (\"O Club\") is an outgrowth comparable to the Officers' Open Mess, but also providing areas to allow officers to entertain guests. A similar version for enlisted personnel is the \"E Club\". ''Mess'' also describes the formal affair of having a \"dining in\", held for military members and closed to the public, or a \"dining out\", a social event for military personnel and their families.\n\nFor much of the 20th century the Army's mess food selection was spartan, but after the end of the draft they changed to a [[food court]] model with more variety including fast food, while also making fast food franchises available on bases. In 2011, the Army rolled out a program known as \"Soldier Athlete\" which promotes healthier foods including low-fat milk, whole grains, and veggie wraps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/02/chocolate_milk_at_every_meal.html|title=Chocolate Milk at Every Meal|first=Kristen|last=Hinman|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=19 January 2017|via=Slate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001147/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/02/chocolate_milk_at_every_meal.html|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== U.S. Navy ===\n{{see also|Mess management specialist}}\n\nAt most [[United States Navy]] shore installations, [[galley (kitchen)|Galleys]] (previously called Enlisted Dining Facilities in the 1970s and early 1980s) provide messing for sailors (and, if assigned, enlisted Marines) ashore and as an option for sailors (and, if assigned, enlisted Marines) aboard ships while in port at those installations. Commissioned officers may use these facilities if in a \"duty officer\" status (e.g., squadron duty officer, command duty officer, etc.) under the pretext of \"inspecting/sampling\" the mess.\n\nIn addition to Galleys ashore, various social clubs with dining facilities may also exist. These are Enlisted Clubs for sailors in the grade of Petty Officer First Class (E-6) and below; Chief Petty Officer Clubs for [[Chief Petty Officer|CPOs]] (E-7), [[SCPO]]s (E-8) and [[Master chief petty officer|MCPOs]] (E-9); and Officers' Clubs for commissioned officers, although many have been closed, merged into combination Enlisted/CPO Clubs, or converted into \"all hands\" enlisted and officer facilities. Such changes began to be imposed following the congressionally-mandated end of DoD budgetary subsidies for all such clubs in the 1990s and the subsequent need for these clubs to be financially self-sufficient.<ref name=Copeland/> Further impacting the club system ashore for the Navy is the fact that most naval units deploy for extended periods (e.g., 6 to 10 months) on a regular basis with, especially for shipboard personnel, requiring for senior enlisted personnel and commissioned officers to maintain concurrent membership in a ship's CPO Mess or officers' [[wardroom]], respectively.\n\nAt sea aboard naval vessels, messing is still separate, with E-6 and below utilizing the ship's mess decks, E-7 through E-9 utilizing the ship's CPO Mess, and commissioned officers being part of the [[wardroom]]. Certain large vessels (e.g., aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships) may also include a First Class Mess for E-6, typically a separate dining area adjacent to the mess decks. This is considered a chance for future CPOs to learn how to be a part of a mess before they enter the CPO Mess, often called by the sobriquet of \"goat locker.\" Enlisted personnel normally receive all meals at what appears to be no cost, but in fact subsidize their meals through forfeiture of their Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), also called \"commuted rations,\" although Chief Petty Officers may also have a mess \"buy in\" and/or monthly mess bill equivalent to the BAS. For those ships with embarked Marine Corps personnel, staff noncommissioned officers in the grades of E-7, E-8 and E-9 will also be part of the CPO Mess. Commissioned Officers retain their BAS, a flat-rate allowance much smaller than the graduated by rank amount paid out to enlisted personnel; however, they must pay for all of their meals while afloat out of pocket. This usually entails a mess \"buy in\" as a member of the officers' mess and will typically have either a monthly mess bill or will purchase meals via some sort of debit card. In one instance onboard the USS FD Roosevelt there was a Marine staff sergeant who ate in the Chief's mess. The story was that the SSGT convinced the command that since E6 and above are staff he should be eligible since in the Navy Chiefs and above are staff.\n\n=== U.S. Air Force ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Twelve O'Clock High]] -->\n[[File:Fort Bragg NCO Club in 1954.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]] NCO Club in 1954]]\nSocial clubs on [[United States Air Force]] installations were at one time called Open Messes, even though most were known in vernacular as Officers Clubs or NCO clubs. Those for officers were able to utilize their initials as colorful acronyms, among the more well-known of which in the 1960s and 1970s were [[Zaragoza Air Base|Zaragosa]] and [[Zweibr\u00fccken Air Base|Zweibr\u00fccken]] (ZOOM), [[Danang Air Base|Danang]] (DOOM), [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]] (ROOM), and [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base|Korat]] Air Bases or [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] (KABOOM), [[Randolph AFB]] (Auger Inn) and [[Nellis AFB]] (Robin's Nest), with the nicknames usually ascribed to those facilities' casual bars versus the entire club.\n\nAt one time, each squadron had its club, and some flying squadrons continue to maintain a bar in the squadron facilities for officer and enlisted aircrew to this day, but most disappeared after World War II and the various Airmen's Clubs, Senior NCO Clubs and Officers' Clubs became facilities of a base rather than a unit. Most are now officially referred to as officer or enlisted clubs; the term \"mess\" or \"officers' open mess\" having largely disappeared from the Air Force lexicon. Though a few bases (usually major training bases) have separate Airmen's Clubs for junior enlisted and NCO Clubs for noncommissioned officers, this is no longer normally the case. Physically separate Officers' Clubs still exist at some installations; however, smaller Air Force installations may have one consolidated club with separate lounges. Membership is voluntary, though highly encouraged for senior NCOs and officers. Most NCO and Officers Clubs contain a sit-down restaurant in addition to social lounges, meeting/dining rooms, and bars.\n\nMess halls in the USAF, where unmarried junior enlisted residing in the [[barracks|dormitories]] are expected to eat, are officially referred to as \"dining facilities,\" but are colloquially called \"chow halls,\" although dining facility workers traditionally take offense at the term.\n\n=== U.S. Marine Corps ===\nIn the [[United States Marine Corps]], enlisted dining facilities ashore are commonly referred to as 'galleys' or 'chow halls.'

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander.

Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS/>\n\n===[[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]]===\n(September 10\u201311, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Campaign Davis's Cross Roads.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863]]\nBragg intended to attack General James S. Negley's isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army at that location. He ordered the divisions of Thomas Hindman and Patrick Cleburne to concentrate together and launch a joint attack under Hindman's command. Due to delays in conveying orders, Cleburne's division failed to arrive in time on the 10th, while Thomas reinforced the isolated division with the rest of his corps including the Lightning Brigade. After the two divisions were united the next day, they failed to launch a coordinated attack on Thomas' positions and were repulsed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the Lightning Brigade played a crucial role. At Alexander's Bridge to the south, the brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, Wilder was able to hold off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 4:30&nbsp;p.m., considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew and established a new blocking position east of the Lafayette Road, near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref>\n\nBy dark, Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. Buckner had been able to push only one brigade across the creek at Thedford's Ford. Polk's troops were facing Crittenden's at Lee and Gordon's Mill and D.H. Hill's corps guarded crossing sites to the south.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n\n\n\n at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS/>\n\n===[[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]]===\n(September 10\u201311, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Campaign Davis's Cross Roads.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863]]\nBragg intended to attack General James S. Negley's isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army at that location. He ordered the divisions of Thomas Hindman and Patrick Cleburne to concentrate together and launch a joint attack under Hindman's command. Due to delays in conveying orders, Cleburne's division failed to arrive in time on the 10th, while Thomas reinforced the isolated division with the rest of his corps including the Lightning Brigade. After the two divisions were united the next day, they failed to launch a coordinated attack on Thomas' positions and were repulsed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n\n\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.
