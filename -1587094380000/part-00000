He continued to pursue his dream and join the army after his graduation. He was commisioned on 14 June 1986 into 18 Dogra of the Dogra Regiment, an infantry regiment with a rich history of gallantry and battle exploits.\n\n==Kupwara operation==\nDuring 1991, [[Captain]] Sandeep Shankla\u2019s unit, 18 Dogra was deployed in Kupwara of J & K area for anti-insurgency operations. On 8th Aug 1991, Captain Sandeep Shankla\u2019s unit had received credible information from intelligence sources about the presence of terrorists in Zafarkhani village in [[Kupwara district]]. A decision was taken by the security forces to launch a search and destroy operation to nab the terrorists under the leadership of  Capt Sandeep Shankla. Capt Sandeep along with his soldiers reached the suspected area and launched a search and cordon operation. The terrorists fired at the troops on being cornered and challenged. A fierce gun battle ensued thereafter with heavy exchange of fire from both sides.\nDuring the cross fire one of the soldiers got injured and Capt Sandeep realizing the danger to his life, crawled and dragged him to safety while eliminating one terrorist. The other terrorist then lobbed two grenades at Capt Sandeep, but in a rare show of courage, he hurled one of the grenades back at the attackers. However, during this process Capt Sandeep sustained splinter and bullet injuries. But he kept engaging with the enemy till he lost his consciousness. He latter succumbed to his injuries and was martyred. The operation led by Capt Sandeep resulted in the elimination of 9 terrorists and in addition 22 of them were apprehended. Capt Sandeep was a valiant soldier and a gritty officer who led from the front like a true military leader. Married just 6 months earlier, Capt Sandeep laid down his life  at the age of 27 years, in the service of the nation.\n\n==Ashoka Chakra awards==\n[[Captain]] Sandeep Shankla was given the nation\u2019s highest peace  time gallantry award, \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his outstanding courage, devotion to duty and supreme sacrifice.

Kanwar and Manju Kanwar.\n \n==Military career==\n[[Captain]] Sandeep right from his childhood wanted to follow into the footsteps of his father and join the army forces. He continued to pursue his dream and join the army after his graduation. He was commisioned on 14 June 1986 into 18 Dogra of the Dogra Regiment, an infantry regiment with a rich history of gallantry and battle exploits.\n\n==Kupwara operation==\nDuring 1991, [[Captain]] Sandeep Shankla\u2019s unit, 18 Dogra was deployed in Kupwara of J & K area for anti-insurgency operations. On 8th Aug 1991, Captain Sandeep Shankla\u2019s unit had received credible information from intelligence sources about the presence of terrorists in Zafarkhani village in [[Kupwara district]]. A decision was taken by the security forces to launch a search and destroy operation to nab the terrorists under the leadership of  Capt Sandeep Shankla. Capt Sandeep along with his soldiers reached the suspected area and launched a search and cordon operation. The terrorists fired at the troops on being cornered and challenged. A fierce gun battle ensued thereafter with heavy exchange of fire from both sides.\nDuring the cross fire one of the soldiers got injured and Capt Sandeep realizing the danger to his life, crawled and dragged him to safety while eliminating one terrorist. The other terrorist then lobbed two grenades at Capt Sandeep, but in a rare show of courage, he hurled one of the grenades back at the attackers. However, during this process Capt Sandeep sustained splinter and bullet injuries. But he kept engaging with the enemy till he lost his consciousness. He latter succumbed to his injuries and was martyred. The operation led by Capt Sandeep resulted in the elimination of 9 terrorists and in addition 22 of them were apprehended. Capt Sandeep was a valiant soldier and a gritty officer who led from the front like a true military leader. Married just 6 months earlier, Capt Sandeep laid down his life  at the age of 27 years, in the service of the nation.\n\n==Ashoka Chakra awards==\n[[Captain]] Sandeep Shankla was given the nation\u2019s highest peace  time gallantry award, \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his outstanding courage, devotion to duty and supreme sacrifice. He is survived by  his father [[Lt Col]]  JS.

It was preceded by the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' and the 1992 film ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'', all three featuring Clancy's character [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]. It is the last film version of Clancy's novels to feature [[Harrison Ford]] as Ryan and [[James Earl Jones]] as Vice Admiral James Greer, as well as the final installment directed by Noyce.\n\nAs in the novel, Ryan is appointed [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Acting Deputy Director (Intelligence) (DDI), and discovers he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are [[CIA activities in Colombia|conducting a covert war]] against a [[drug cartel]] in [[Colombia]], apparently with the approval of the President. The film premiered in theaters in the United States on August 3, 1994, and was a major financial success, earning over $200 million at the box office.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe discovery of the murder of an American businessman, Peter Hardin, and his family, outrages U.S. President Bennett, Hardin's personal friend. When Hardin is found to have been connected to a Colombian [[drug cartel]], from which he skimmed over $650 million, Bennett tells James Cutter, his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], that the cartels represent a \"[[clear and present danger]]\" to the United States, tacitly instructing him to use force against the men responsible for his friend's murder. Jack Ryan, appointed acting [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of Intelligence]] after Vice Admiral Jim Greer is stricken with cancer, asks Congress for increased funding for ongoing [[CIA activities in Colombia|CIA operations in Colombia]], believing the funds to be for advisory purposes only.\n\nKeeping Ryan in the dark, Cutter turns to CIA [[Director of the National Clandestine Service|Deputy Director of Operations]] Bob Ritter to take down the cartel. Ritter assembles a [[black operation]]s team code named RECIPROCITY with the help of [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]]. The team inserts itself into Colombia, with Clark running logistics and Captain Ricardo Ramirez of a [[US Army Special Forces|SF-ODA]] team commanding the squad on the ground in clandestine [[search-and-destroy]] missions against the drug cartel. Meanwhile, Bennett sends Ryan to Colombia to investigate Hardin's cartel connection.\n\nThe cartel leader responsible for Hardin's murder, Ernesto Escobedo, is enraged when the U.S. attempts to claim the $650 million that was stolen from him, and has his intelligence officer, F\u00e9lix Cortez, try to retrieve the funds. Bennett sends [[FBI Director]] Emil Jacobs to meet Ryan in Colombia and negotiate for the money, and when Cortez discovers this, he plans an ambush, engineering it so that suspicion will fall on Escobedo. Ryan barely escapes the ambush by cartel hitmen, but the remainder of the entourage is killed. Escobedo then summons a meeting with other cartel leaders, which Clark's team hits with an airstrike, but Escobedo is late arriving and survives.\n\nCortez discovers the American involvement in the strike, and meets with Cutter to broker a deal. Cortez will assassinate Escobedo and take over the cartel, promising to reduce drug shipments to the U.S. and allow American law enforcement to make regular arrests to make it appear as if the U.S. is winning the [[War on drugs|drug war]]. In exchange, Cutter will shut down all U.S. operations in Colombia and allow Cortez to hunt down Clark's soldiers. Cutter agrees and orders Ritter to get rid of all evidence of their operations and cut off the troops in Colombia from all support. Ryan is played a recording of the conversation between Cutter and Cortez. He hacks Ritter's computer and discovers the conspiracy unfolding in Colombia.\n\nThe Reciprocity team is ambushed in Colombia by Cortez's mercenaries. Ryan arrives and convinces Clark to allow him to help. They find the team's [[sniper]], Chavez, who tells them that Ramirez and a squadmate have been captured and the remainder have been killed. Ryan visits Escobedo's mansion and shares his intelligence on Cortez. Enraged, Escobedo confronts Cortez, but is killed by Cortez's associate. Ryan, Clark, and Ch\u00e1vez rescue the prisoners, kill Cortez, and escape.\n\nRyan confronts the President and tells him he intends to inform the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Congressional Oversight Committee]] about the conspiracy despite the damage it could do to his career. As he walks out of the [[Oval Office]], Cutter asks to speak with him, but Ryan ignores him.

Ryan then begins his testimony to Congress.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]]\n* [[Joaquim de Almeida]] as Colonel F\u00e9lix Cortez\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Ernesto Escobedo\n* [[Henry Czerny]] as Bob Ritter\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as James Cutter\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as President Bennett\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Captain Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Domingo Chavez\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Jim Greer\n* Tom Tammi as Emile Jacobs\n* Tim Grimm as Dan Murray\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Cathy Ryan\n* [[Ann Magnuson]] as Moira Wolfson\n* [[Belita Moreno]] as Jean Fowler\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Judge Moore\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Petey\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Sally Ryan\n* [[Ellen Geer]] as Rose\n* [[Hope Lange]] as Senator Mayo\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Enrique Rojas\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAfter completing ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', [[John McTiernan]] had wanted to direct an adaptation of ''Clear and Present Danger'', and departed from the production after an early script by [[John Milius]] was rejected in favor of ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/revisiting-patriot-games-the-first-jack-ryan-reboot/|title=Revisiting Patriot Games: The First Jack Ryan \"Reboot\"|date=2015-03-26|website=Den of Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> Milius's first draft was more faithful to the original book than the final film, and he later added the sequence where Jack Ryan is ambushed in [[Sports Utility Vehicle|SUV]]s. He said that the original ending had Cortez going to Washington to kill the National Security Advisor, only to be killed in a mugging by drug addicts.<ref>Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

In March 1992, [[Donald E. Stewart]] was hired to rewrite Milius's script to provide greater screen time to Jack Ryan. After Clancy openly criticized the script, [[Steven Zaillian]] rewrote it further in an attempt to gain his approval. Milius was retained during production to provide consultation on the action scenes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/08/19/harrison-ford-takes-tom-clancyagain/|title=Harrison Ford takes on Tom Clancy...again|website=EW.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> \n\n=== Production ===\nThe film was shot in [[Mexico]] after the studio decided that filming on-location in Columbia was too dangerous, with [[Mexico City]] standing in for [[Bogot\u00e1]] and the Hacienda San Gabriel de la Palmas in [[Cuernavaca]] serving as a set for Escobedo's headquarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/24/cool-movie-sets-clear-and-present-danger/|title=Cool Movie Sets: 'Clear and Present Danger'|website=EW.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>  Ironically, the decision to produce the film in Mexico encountered further difficulties due to the outbreak of the [[Chiapas conflict]]. The film ran drastically behind schedule and over budget, and part of the footage shot in the United States was destroyed due to the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].

{"title_page": "Legal status of tattooing in the United States", "text_new": "In the [[United States]] there is no federal law regulating the practice of [[tattooing]]. However, all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be at least 14 years old. This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor cannot enter into a legal contract or otherwise render [[informed consent]] for a procedure.  Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian, but some states prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission, with the exception of medical necessity (such as markings placed for [[radiation therapy]]).\n\nIn all jurisdictions, individual tattooists may also choose to place additional restrictions based on their own moral feelings, such as refusing ''any'' clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being legal, or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to tattoo (such as refusing any work around inappropriate  parts of the body).  They may additionally refuse to perform specific artwork, including if they merely find it inappropriate or offensive, or refuse to work on a client that they suspect may be intoxicated.  Artists sometimes claim their personal business restrictions are a matter of law even when it is not true, so as to avoid arguments with clients.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Legal Restrictions on Tattooing & Body Modification by State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"50px\" |State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"50px\" |Minimum Age (with parent/guardian consent)\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Form of Parent/Guardian Consent\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Notes & Exceptions\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"75px\" |Intoxicated/Impaired Individuals\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Area of Law/Type of Penalty\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Licensing & Regulation\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"75px\" |Relevant Statute(s) and Rules\n|-\n!

However, all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be at least 18 years old. This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor cannot enter into a legal contract or otherwise render [[informed consent]] for a procedure.  Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian, but some states prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission, with the exception of medical necessity (such as markings placed for [[radiation therapy]]).\n\nIn all jurisdictions, individual tattooists may also choose to place additional restrictions based on their own moral feelings, such as refusing ''any'' clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being legal, or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to tattoo (such as refusing any work around inappropriate  parts of the body).  They may additionally refuse to perform specific artwork, including if they merely find it inappropriate or offensive, or refuse to work on a client that they suspect may be intoxicated.  Artists sometimes claim their personal business restrictions are a matter of law even when it is not true, so as to avoid arguments with clients.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Legal Restrictions on Tattooing & Body Modification by State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"50px\" |State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"50px\" |Minimum Age (with parent/guardian consent)\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Form of Parent/Guardian Consent\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Notes & Exceptions\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"75px\" |Intoxicated/Impaired Individuals\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Area of Law/Type of Penalty\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" |Licensing & Regulation\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"75px\" |Relevant Statute(s) and Rules\n|-\n!

The object in this game is to collect six cheese pieces. Instead of being eliminated from the game when caught by the trap, a player only forfeits a cheese piece to the opponent.

Glass went on to develop two less well-known games based on Goldberg designs, ''[[Crazy Clock Game]]'' (1964) and ''[[Fish Bait]]'' (1965), neither of which credited Goldberg's influence. Elderly and near retirement, Goldberg declined to take legal action against Glass because inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be protected with a copyright, trademark, or patent, and instead chose to sell licensing rights for his drawings to another toy company, Model Products, to help secure the rights to specific intellectual property that he owned and for which he might receive royalties.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0740755714&id=jftapGDTmYUC&pg=RA4-PA157&lpg=RA4-PA157&ots=_pYiRJ5pnY&dq=%22rube+goldberg%22+%22mouse+trap%22+game&sig=MD9F2MIPNmfAK2kfMvzdkhhcm1A ''Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them''] from [[Google Books]]</ref>\n\n==Television==\n''Mouse Trap'' was adapted into a [[game show]] which  was featured on the British children's television show ''[[Motormouth]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01h0q9w|title=BBC Two - I Love the 1970s|website=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Motormouth|title=Mousetrap - UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com}}</ref> A life-size board game was created and the child contestants took the place of the mice.\n\n==Similar games==\n{{Infobox game\n\n| name = Crazy Clock Game\n| AKA = Crazy Clock\n| manufacturer = [[Ideal Toy Company]]\n| publisher = Ideal Toy Company\n| date = <!-- {{Start date and age|df=n|1964}} -->\n| years = 1964 - ?\n| genre = [[:Category:Roll-and-move board games|Roll-and-move]]\n| language = English\n| players = 2-4\n| setup_time = 15 min {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n| playing_time = 30 min\n}}\nSimilar games by Ideal include the '''''Crazy Clock Game''''' (''Crazy Clock'') and '''Fish Bait Game''', published by [[Ideal Toy Company]] in [[1964]].

The object in this game is to collect six cheese pieces. Instead of being eliminated from the game, a player only forfeits a cheese piece to the opponent.

Glass went on to develop two less well-known games based on Goldberg designs, ''[[Crazy Clock Game]]'' (1964) and ''[[Fish Bait]]'' (1965), neither of which credited Goldberg's influence. Elderly and near retirement, Goldberg declined to take legal action against Glass because inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be protected with a copyright, trademark, or patent, and instead chose to sell licensing rights for his drawings to another toy company, Model Products, to help secure the rights to specific intellectual property that he owned and for which he might receive royalties.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0740755714&id=jftapGDTmYUC&pg=RA4-PA157&lpg=RA4-PA157&ots=_pYiRJ5pnY&dq=%22rube+goldberg%22+%22mouse+trap%22+game&sig=MD9F2MIPNmfAK2kfMvzdkhhcm1A ''Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them''] from [[Google Books]]</ref>\n\n==Television==\n''Mouse Trap'' was adapted into a [[game show]] which  was featured on the British children's television show ''[[Motormouth]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01h0q9w|title=BBC Two - I Love the 1970s|website=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Motormouth|title=Mousetrap - UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com}}</ref> A life-size board game was created and the child contestants took the place of the mice.\n\n==Similar games==\n{{Infobox game\n\n| name = Crazy Clock Game\n| AKA = Crazy Clock\n| manufacturer = [[Ideal Toy Company]]\n| publisher = Ideal Toy Company\n| date = <!-- {{Start date and age|df=n|1964}} -->\n| years = 1964 - ?\n| genre = [[:Category:Roll-and-move board games|Roll-and-move]]\n| language = English\n| players = 2-4\n| setup_time = 15 min {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n| playing_time = 30 min\n}}\nSimilar games by Ideal include the '''''Crazy Clock Game''''' (''Crazy Clock'') and '''Fish Bait Game''', published by [[Ideal Toy Company]] in [[1964]].

His first appearance is in ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. Gordon Freeman is an [[United States|American]] man from [[Seattle]], who graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Theoretical Physics]]. He was an employee at the fictional [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. Controlled by the player, Gordon is often tasked with using a wide range of weapons and tools to fight alien creatures such as [[headcrabs]], as well as [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] machines and soldiers.\n\nGordon Freeman's character has been well received by critics and gamers, and various gaming websites often consider him to be one of the greatest video game characters of all time, including [[UGO]]<ref name=\":1\" /> and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Gordon Freeman concept art.png|thumb|left|150px|An early concept art of Gordon Freeman, wearing a bulkier HEV suit, helmet, and goggles.]]\n\n''Half-Life'' director [[Gabe Newell]] coined the name \"Gordon Freeman\" during a conversation with the game's writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] in his car. Laidlaw had originally named the character \"Dyson Poincar\u00e9\", combining the names of physicist and philosopher [[Freeman Dyson]] and mathematician [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]. The texture for Gordon's head was \"too big of a job for just one person\", so Valve designers combined references from four people. An earlier model of Gordon, known as \"Ivan the Space Biker\", had a full beard that was subsequently trimmed. Other iterations of Gordon's concept featured different glasses, a ponytail, and a helmet.<ref name=\"raising the bar\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|last=Hodgson|first=David|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7615-4364-3|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pied-de-biche 01.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], Freeman's most iconic weapon.]]\nGordon wears a special full-body [[hazmat suit]], known as the '''H'''azardous '''E'''n'''v'''ironment Suit (or HEV Suit). The suit is designed to protect the user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit's main feature is its \"high-impact [[reactive armor]]\", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer in ''Half-Life'' and 80% in ''Half-Life 2''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in [[flashlight]], a radio, various tracking devices, a [[compass]], and a [[Geiger counter]]. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.\nAs a means of immersing the player in the role, Gordon [[Silent protagonist|never speaks]], and there are no cutscenes or mission briefings\u2014all action is viewed through Gordon's eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordon's actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the game's cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is \"really like\". [[Gabe Newell]] has stated that [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] sees no reason to give Gordon a voice.<ref name=\"no reason\">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |title=Gabe Newell: Next Half-Life won't change Gordon Freeman |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=2010-04-04 |publisher=Computer and Video Games |accessdate=2012-12-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409061413/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |archivedate=2010-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Half-Life'', Gordon wears the ''Mark IV'' suit. Later in the game, the suit is equipped with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' Gordon receives the upgraded ''Mark V'' suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual [[Zoom lens|zoom]]ing capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and health counter on the [[crosshair]], and the capability to use [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] power nodes to charge the suit.\n\nThe ''Mark V'' initially used a single power source for the flashlight, sprinting, and oxygen supply; in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' the flashlight was given a separate power source to improve gameplay. The symbol on Gordon's HEV suit is the lower case Greek letter [[Lambda]], \u03bb. This symbol is used by scientists to denote the [[decay constant]] of radioactive elements (related to the [[half-life]] of an element). As well as appearing on Gordon's suit, the symbol replaces the letter \"a\" in the game title (''H'''\u03bb'''lf-Life''), and is the name of the complex in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] where teleportation experiments are conducted in the first game. The Lambda symbol is also seen in ''Half-Life 2'' as a marking of the human resistance, seen close to hidden supplies and on the arm bands of better equipped resistance fighters.\n\n==Fictional biography==\n===Background and skills===\n[[File:FreemanJobLetter.jpg|thumb|120px|Freeman's acceptance letter from Black Mesa.]]\n\nA [[Seattle]] native, Gordon exhibited an early interest in theoretical physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. His childhood heroes were [[Albert Einstein]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[Richard Feynman]].<ref name=\"Early idols\">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLGameInfo.Detail&id=5&game=4 |title=The Half-Life Story |work=Planet Half-Life |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222101319/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLGameInfo.Detail&id=5&game=4 |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref> After observing a series of teleportation experiments conducted by the Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of Innsbruck]], the transmission of matter became Gordon's obsession.

He takes up residence at Black Mesa, conducting [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[subatomic]] research in its Anomalous Materials department. Despite his education as a theoretical physicist, the work Freeman is involved with at Black Mesa is of a more [[experimental physicist|experimental nature]].\n\nThe games often make light of the fact that the tasks Gordon performs amount to little more than manual labor, despite his qualifications. Gordon's assigned job at the start of ''Half-Life'' consists of little more than pressing a button and pushing a cart. [[Barney Calhoun]] wryly notes this irony at the beginning of ''Half-Life 2'', when Freeman performs similar \"technical\" assistance by flipping a switch and returning a plug to its socket.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|level=Chapter 2: \"A Red Letter Day\"|quote='''Barney Calhoun''': Good job, Gordon. Throwing that switch and all. I can see your MIT education really pays for itself.}}</ref>\n\nA [[silent protagonist]], Gordon does not say a single word during the entire ''Half-Life'' saga. Although as proficient as the player with weapons and explosives, Freeman had not actually handled any weapons until some cursory training at the Black Mesa Research Facility's Hazard Course.<ref name=primesg_hl>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Joe Grant|title=Half-Life: Prima Official Strategy Guide|publisher=Prima Games|year=2000|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life''===\nIn ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', Gordon Freeman is part of a research team performing an experiment that inadvertently creates an inter-dimensional rift in spacetime. Intelligent (and confused) alien lifeforms from the Xen dimension come pouring through multiple breaches inside the Black Mesa facility, attacking anyone in sight. As scientific, military and civilian personnel fall under the alien onslaught, Freeman finds himself targeted not only by the alien monsters, but also the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU), a U.S. Marine Corps military force sent to contain the situation.\n\nThe untrained theoretical physicist somehow manages to survive the chaos, impressing the few surviving scientists and security guards with his heroic acts, while quickly becoming the HECU's high-priority target. Freeman is eventually transported to Xen by a few surviving Lambda Sector scientists. After the successful elimination of the alien leader Nihilanth, Freeman meets the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been remotely observing Freeman throughout the entire Black Mesa Incident. He briefly teleports Freeman to several locations throughout Earth and Xen, ending on a train (much like how the game begins) where he offers Freeman a choice, either agree to work for him and his mysterious \"employers\" or be left to die on Xen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Heather|authorlink=|title=Half-Life instruction manual|url=|accessdate=|year=1998|publisher=Valve|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe two expansions for ''Half-Life'' feature different playable characters and take place during the events of the main game, and as such Gordon is seen at certain points of the games. In these appearances, Gordon maintains his silence, even though he is not the protagonist. In ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'', [[Adrian Shephard]] only encounters Gordon once when he witnesses Gordon teleport to [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] in the Lambda Complex. Attempts to follow him through the same portal will result in a \"[[temporal paradox]]\" which sends Shephard falling through Xen's void and ends the game. Gordon is also seen three times by Barney Calhoun during the course of ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]''. Barney first sees Gordon passing by in a tram at the beginning of the game, later heading towards the HEV storage area through a surveillance camera, and lastly being dragged to a trash compactor by a pair of HECU troops.\n\n===''Half-Life 2'' and Episodes===\n''[[Half-Life 2]]'' begins as the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him \"in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] far from Earth, thought, and time itself\" for nearly two decades, during which he did not physically age.<ref>[http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php Half-Life 2: Episode One story page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725080723/http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php |date=2008-07-25 }}.

He soon meets up with [[Barney Calhoun]] and [[Alyx Vance]], and joins the resistance against the Combine.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Gordon battles the forces of the Combine in order to free humanity from its grasp. Already famous for his role in the Black Mesa Incident, Gordon quickly develops a legendary reputation among Earth's surviving human populace, who begin to look up to him and refer to him by such messianic titles as \"the One Free Man\" or \"the Opener of the Way.\" After slaying scores of Combine soldiers and leading an assault against the Combine stronghold of Nova Prospekt, Gordon eventually sparks a full-scale rebellion, in which he becomes a combatant. Gordon infiltrates one of the Combine's footholds on Earth, City 17's Citadel, and destroys it by detonating its Dark Energy Reactor.\n\nIn doing so, he also prevents antagonist [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], the Combine's human representative on Earth and Gordon's former administrator at Black Mesa, from escaping via teleporter, thereby possibly killing him. Although caught in the reactor's explosion along with Alyx Vance, Gordon is rescued by the G-Man (apparently leaving Alyx Vance to face the explosion alone), who tells Freeman that he is impressed with his work and has received \"several tempting offers\" for his \"services.\" He deposits Freeman back in stasis, this time without giving him \"the illusion of free choice\".<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2|developer=Valve|level=Chapter 14: Dark Energy|quote='''G-Man''': Time, ''Doctor'' Freeman? Is it really that...time again? It seems as if you only just arrived. / ''[The G-Man \"walks out\" from the explosion.]'' / '''G-Man''': You've done a great deal in a small time...span.

I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of...well, I'm really not at liberty to say. In the meantime...'''''this is where I get off.''''' ''(smiles, then walks away)''}}</ref>\n\n''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' rejoins Gordon and Alyx Vance, who are separately removed from the G-Man's stasis by the [[Vortigaunt]]s and rescued a split second before the reactor explosion, greatly displeasing the G-Man. Gordon regains consciousness under a pile of rubble and is found by Alyx and Dog. Their proximity to the Citadel, coupled with its imminent explosion, which would level much of City 17, requires them to go back inside and stabilize the core, stalling the structure's destruction long enough for both themselves and much of the human population to escape. Gordon and Alyx succeed in doing so, but learn that the local Combine forces are attempting to send a distress message for off-world assistance, using the Citadel's destruction to power the transmission.\n\nThe Combine consider this a positive, as the subsequent explosion would destroy all of City 17 and much of the surrounding countryside, which has been all but lost to human resistance forces. With a copy of the distress message, Gordon and Alyx escape the Citadel and meet up with Barney and other survivors. The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One |developer=Valve |publisher=Valve |date=2006-06-01 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] |quote= '''Alyx:''' Oh my god! The transmission is going out!}}</ref> The resulting shockwave derails their train.\n\nIn ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', Gordon wakes up in the wrecked train and is freed by Alyx, who had earlier escaped the wreckage. A massive superportal is forming over what was once City 17, which will allow the Combine to send an invasion fleet once it is fully formed. The data they carry is the key to destroying it. Gordon and Alyx make their way to White Forest, an apparent Soviet-era missile base turned into a rebel stronghold, where the data can be sent to an orbiting satellite via a rocket, which will allow the resistance to collapse the portal. After Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter, Gordon assists the Vortigaunts in saving her, their healing ritual giving the G-Man the opportunity to speak to Gordon. During this conversation, the G-Man reveals to Gordon that he saved Alyx from the Black Mesa incident. He also embeds a message in Alyx's brain for her father, Eli: \"prepare for unforeseen consequences.\"\n\nWhen the duo reaches White Forest, after a run-in with a Combine Advisor, they are reunited with Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Eli Vance, and are formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, who has taken control of the base. After Gordon seals the silo from a Combine attack, Gordon, Alyx, Dr. Kleiner, and Dr. Eli Vance watch the transmission from Dr. Mossman seen in ''Episode One'', acquired with the stolen Combine data. It reveals that she has located the ''Borealis'', an [[Aperture Science]] research vessel which contains something supposedly capable of causing \"another Black Mesa.\" The G-Man compels Alyx to deliver his message, and once Eli sends her away he reveals that he, too, knows of the G-Man, referring to him as \"our mutual friend.\" With the Combine now sending Striders to shoot the rocket down, Magnusson enlists Gordon's aid in stopping them through the use of his special explosive charges known as Magnusson Devices and Gordon's [[Gravity Gun]].\n\nAfter repelling the attack, the rocket is launched and the portal is destroyed. As Gordon and Alyx prepare to leave for the ''Borealis'' in an old helicopter, they are ambushed by Advisors, which kill Eli before Dog forces them to flee. The game ends with Alyx mourning over Eli's body.<ref name=orangebox_pgg>{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=David|authorlink1=|last2=Stratton|first2=Stephen|last3=Miguel|first3=Miguel|title=The Orange Box: Prima Official Game Guide|url=|accessdate=|year=2007|publication-date=9 October 2007|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|location=|isbn=9780761556930|page=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=David|authorlink=|title=Half-Life 2: Prima Official Game Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/halflife2primaof0000hodg|accessdate=|year=2004|publisher=Prima Games|location=|isbn=0-7615-4362-7|page=|pages=|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life: Alyx''===\nUnlike previous games in the series, the player does not control Gordon and instead controls Alyx Vance. The game is set between the events of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2,'' and Alyx is attempting to locate Gordon to help overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth. At the end of the game, she reaches a Combine prison that she believes to contain Gordon and she releases its occupant, only to discover it is the G-Man.\n\nThe G-Man shows Alyx the future, with her crying over Eli's body at the end of ''Episode 2.'' The G-Man gives her the opportunity to change the future by killing the Combine Advisor that kills her father. She does so, and the G-Man is impressed, saying that she would be more capable of completing his missions than \"a previous hire who was unable - or unwilling\" to do so. As he says this, he holds a crowbar, before standing to the side to reveal Gordon, who bends down to pick up his glasses, in the first appearance of the character in the series from a third-person perspective. The G-Man then forces Alyx into stasis, awaiting a mission to be assigned to her.\n\nAfter the end credits, the player now has control of Gordon at the end of ''Episode 2,'' albeit with the changed events caused by the G-Man. Eli is furious that Alyx has disappeared, and knows that it must be the G-Man that has taken her. The G-Man can in fact be seen watching events from a balcony at the side of the room, unbeknownst to Eli. Dog jumps in through the window behind him and holds out Gordon's crowbar in his hand. Eli takes it, hands it to Gordon and says \"we've got work to do.\"\n\n==Reception==\nGordon Freeman quickly became and then remained one of the most popular video game characters ever.

His first appearance is in ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. Gordon Freeman is an [[United States|American]] man from [[Seattle]], who graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Theoretical Physics]]. He was an employee at the fictional [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. Controlled by the player, Gordon is often tasked with using a wide range of weapons and tools to fight alien creatures such as [[headcrabs]], as well as [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] machines and soldiers.\n\nGordon Freeman's character has been well received by critics and gamers, and various gaming websites often consider him to be one of the greatest video game characters of all time, including [[UGO]]<ref name=\":1\" /> and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Gordon Freeman concept art.png|thumb|left|150px|An early concept art of Gordon Freeman, wearing a bulkier HEV suit, helmet, and goggles.]]\n\n''Half-Life'' director [[Gabe Newell]] coined the name \"Gordon Freeman\" during a conversation with the game's writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] in his car. Laidlaw had originally named the character \"Dyson Poincar\u00e9\", combining the names of physicist and philosopher [[Freeman Dyson]] and mathematician [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]. The texture for Gordon's head was \"too big of a job for just one person\", so Valve designers combined references from four people. An earlier model of Gordon, known as \"Ivan the Space Biker\", had a full beard that was subsequently trimmed. Other iterations of Gordon's concept featured different glasses, a ponytail, and a helmet.<ref name=\"raising the bar\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|last=Hodgson|first=David|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7615-4364-3|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pied-de-biche 01.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], Freeman's most iconic weapon.]]\nGordon wears a special full-body [[hazmat suit]], known as the '''H'''azardous '''E'''n'''v'''ironment Suit (or HEV Suit). The suit is designed to protect the user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit's main feature is its \"high-impact [[reactive armor]]\", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer in ''Half-Life'' and 80% in ''Half-Life 2''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in [[flashlight]], a radio, various tracking devices, a [[compass]], and a [[Geiger counter]]. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.\nAs a means of immersing the player in the role, Gordon [[Silent protagonist|never speaks]], and there are no cutscenes or mission briefings\u2014all action is viewed through Gordon's eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordon's actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the game's cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is \"really like\". [[Gabe Newell]] has stated that [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] sees no reason to give Gordon a voice.<ref name=\"no reason\">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |title=Gabe Newell: Next Half-Life won't change Gordon Freeman |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=2010-04-04 |publisher=Computer and Video Games |accessdate=2012-12-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409061413/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |archivedate=2010-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Half-Life'', Gordon wears the ''Mark IV'' suit. Later in the game, the suit is equipped with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' Gordon receives the upgraded ''Mark V'' suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual [[Zoom lens|zoom]]ing capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and health counter on the [[crosshair]], and the capability to use [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] power nodes to charge the suit.\n\nThe ''Mark V'' initially used a single power source for the flashlight, sprinting, and oxygen supply; in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' the flashlight was given a separate power source to improve gameplay. The symbol on Gordon's HEV suit is the lower case Greek letter [[Lambda]], \u03bb. This symbol is used by scientists to denote the [[decay constant]] of radioactive elements (related to the [[half-life]] of an element). As well as appearing on Gordon's suit, the symbol replaces the letter \"a\" in the game title (''H'''\u03bb'''lf-Life''), and is the name of the complex in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] where teleportation experiments are conducted in the first game. The Lambda symbol is also seen in ''Half-Life 2'' as a marking of the human resistance, seen close to hidden supplies and on the arm bands of better equipped resistance fighters.\n\n==Fictional biography==\n===Background and skills===\n[[File:FreemanJobLetter.jpg|thumb|120px|Freeman's acceptance letter from Black Mesa.]]\n\nA [[Seattle]] native, Gordon exhibited an early interest in theoretical physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]].

He takes up residence at Black Mesa, conducting [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[subatomic]] research in its Anomalous Materials department. Despite his education as a theoretical physicist, the work Freeman is involved with at Black Mesa is of a more [[experimental physicist|experimental nature]].\n\nThe games often make light of the fact that the tasks Gordon performs amount to little more than manual labor, despite his qualifications. Gordon's assigned job at the start of ''Half-Life'' consists of little more than pressing a button and pushing a cart. [[Barney Calhoun]] wryly notes this irony at the beginning of ''Half-Life 2'', when Freeman performs similar \"technical\" assistance by flipping a switch and returning a plug to its socket.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|level=Chapter 2: \"A Red Letter Day\"|quote='''Barney Calhoun''': Good job, Gordon.

Although as proficient as the player with weapons and explosives, Freeman had not actually handled any weapons until some cursory training at the Black Mesa Research Facility's Hazard Course.<ref name=primesg_hl>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Joe Grant|title=Half-Life: Prima Official Strategy Guide|publisher=Prima Games|year=2000|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life''===\nIn ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', Gordon Freeman is part of a research team performing an experiment that inadvertently creates an inter-dimensional rift in spacetime. Intelligent (and confused) alien lifeforms from the Xen dimension come pouring through multiple breaches inside the Black Mesa facility, attacking anyone in sight. As scientific, military and civilian personnel fall under the alien onslaught, Freeman finds himself targeted not only by the alien monsters, but also the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU), a U.S. Marine Corps military force sent to contain the situation.\n\nThe untrained theoretical physicist somehow manages to survive the chaos, impressing the few surviving scientists and security guards with his heroic acts, while quickly becoming the HECU's high-priority target. Freeman is eventually transported to Xen by a few surviving Lambda Sector scientists. After the successful elimination of the alien leader Nihilanth, Freeman meets the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been remotely observing Freeman throughout the entire Black Mesa Incident. He briefly teleports Freeman to several locations throughout Earth and Xen, ending on a train (much like how the game begins) where he offers Freeman a choice, either agree to work for him and his mysterious \"employers\" or be left to die on Xen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Heather|authorlink=|title=Half-Life instruction manual|url=|accessdate=|year=1998|publisher=Valve|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe two expansions for ''Half-Life'' feature different playable characters and take place during the events of the main game, and as such Gordon is seen at certain points of the games. In these appearances, Gordon maintains his silence, even though he is not the protagonist. In ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'', [[Adrian Shephard]] only encounters Gordon once when he witnesses Gordon teleport to [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] in the Lambda Complex. Attempts to follow him through the same portal will result in a \"[[temporal paradox]]\" which sends Shephard falling through Xen's void and ends the game. Gordon is also seen three times by Barney Calhoun during the course of ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]''. Barney first sees Gordon passing by in a tram at the beginning of the game, later heading towards the HEV storage area through a surveillance camera, and lastly being dragged to a trash compactor by a pair of HECU troops.\n\n===''Half-Life 2'' and Episodes===\n''[[Half-Life 2]]'' begins as the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him \"in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] far from Earth, thought, and time itself\" for nearly two decades, during which he did not physically age.<ref>[http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php Half-Life 2: Episode One story page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725080723/http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php |date=2008-07-25 }}.

He soon meets up with [[Barney Calhoun]] and [[Alyx Vance]], and joins the resistance against the Combine.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Gordon battles the forces of the Combine in order to free humanity from its grasp. Already famous for his role in the Black Mesa Incident, Gordon quickly develops a legendary reputation among Earth's surviving human populace, who begin to look up to him and refer to him by such messianic titles as \"the One Free Man\" or \"the Opener of the Way.\" After slaying scores of Combine soldiers and leading an assault against the Combine stronghold of Nova Prospekt, Gordon eventually sparks a full-scale rebellion, in which he becomes a combatant. Gordon infiltrates one of the Combine's footholds on Earth, City 17's Citadel, and destroys it by detonating its Dark Energy Reactor.\n\nIn doing so, he also prevents antagonist [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], the Combine's human representative on Earth and Gordon's former administrator at Black Mesa, from escaping via teleporter, thereby possibly killing him. Although caught in the reactor's explosion along with Alyx Vance, Gordon is rescued by the G-Man (apparently leaving Alyx Vance to face the explosion alone), who tells Freeman that he is impressed with his work and has received \"several tempting offers\" for his \"services.\" He deposits Freeman back in stasis, this time without giving him \"the illusion of free choice\".<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2|developer=Valve|level=Chapter 14: Dark Energy|quote='''G-Man''': Time, ''Doctor'' Freeman?

''(smiles, then walks away)''}}</ref>\n\n''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' rejoins Gordon and Alyx Vance, who are separately removed from the G-Man's stasis by the [[Vortigaunt]]s and rescued a split second before the reactor explosion, greatly displeasing the G-Man. Gordon regains consciousness under a pile of rubble and is found by Alyx and Dog. Their proximity to the Citadel, coupled with its imminent explosion, which would level much of City 17, requires them to go back inside and stabilize the core, stalling the structure's destruction long enough for both themselves and much of the human population to escape. Gordon and Alyx succeed in doing so, but learn that the local Combine forces are attempting to send a distress message for off-world assistance, using the Citadel's destruction to power the transmission.\n\nThe Combine consider this a positive, as the subsequent explosion would destroy all of City 17 and much of the surrounding countryside, which has been all but lost to human resistance forces. With a copy of the distress message, Gordon and Alyx escape the Citadel and meet up with Barney and other survivors. The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One |developer=Valve |publisher=Valve |date=2006-06-01 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] |quote= '''Alyx:''' Oh my god! The transmission is going out!}}</ref> The resulting shockwave derails their train.\n\nIn ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', Gordon wakes up in the wrecked train and is freed by Alyx, who had earlier escaped the wreckage. A massive superportal is forming over what was once City 17, which will allow the Combine to send an invasion fleet once it is fully formed. The data they carry is the key to destroying it. Gordon and Alyx make their way to White Forest, an apparent Soviet-era missile base turned into a rebel stronghold, where the data can be sent to an orbiting satellite via a rocket, which will allow the resistance to collapse the portal. After Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter, Gordon assists the Vortigaunts in saving her, their healing ritual giving the G-Man the opportunity to speak to Gordon. During this conversation, the G-Man reveals to Gordon that he saved Alyx from the Black Mesa incident. He also embeds a message in Alyx's brain for her father, Eli: \"prepare for unforeseen consequences.\"\n\nWhen the duo reaches White Forest, after a run-in with a Combine Advisor, they are reunited with Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Eli Vance, and are formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, who has taken control of the base. After Gordon seals the silo from a Combine attack, Gordon, Alyx, Dr. Kleiner, and Dr. Eli Vance watch the transmission from Dr. Mossman seen in ''Episode One'', acquired with the stolen Combine data. It reveals that she has located the ''Borealis'', an [[Aperture Science]] research vessel which contains something supposedly capable of causing \"another Black Mesa.\" The G-Man compels Alyx to deliver his message, and once Eli sends her away he reveals that he, too, knows of the G-Man, referring to him as \"our mutual friend.\" With the Combine now sending Striders to shoot the rocket down, Magnusson enlists Gordon's aid in stopping them through the use of his special explosive charges known as Magnusson Devices and Gordon's [[Gravity Gun]].\n\nAfter repelling the attack, the rocket is launched and the portal is destroyed. As Gordon and Alyx prepare to leave for the ''Borealis'' in an old helicopter, they are ambushed by Advisors, which kill Eli before Dog forces them to flee. The game ends with Alyx mourning over Eli's body.<ref name=orangebox_pgg>{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=David|authorlink1=|last2=Stratton|first2=Stephen|last3=Miguel|first3=Miguel|title=The Orange Box: Prima Official Game Guide|url=|accessdate=|year=2007|publication-date=9 October 2007|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|location=|isbn=9780761556930|page=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=David|authorlink=|title=Half-Life 2: Prima Official Game Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/halflife2primaof0000hodg|accessdate=|year=2004|publisher=Prima Games|location=|isbn=0-7615-4362-7|page=|pages=|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life: Alyx''===\nUnlike previous games in the series, the player does not control Gordon and instead controls Alyx Vance. The game is set between the events of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2,'' and Alyx is attempting to locate Gordon to help overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth. At the end of the game, she reaches a Combine prison that she believes to contain Gordon and she releases its occupant, only to discover it is the G-Man.\n\nThe G-Man shows Alyx the future, with her crying over Eli's body at the end of ''Episode 2.'' The G-Man gives her the opportunity to change the future by killing the Combine Advisor that kills her father. She does so, and the G-Man is impressed, saying that she would be more capable of completing his missions than \"a previous hire who was unable - or unwilling\" to do so. As he says this, he holds a crowbar, before standing to the side to reveal Gordon, who bends down to pick up his glasses, in the first appearance of the character in the series from a third-person perspective. The G-Man then forces Alyx into stasis, awaiting a mission to be assigned to her.\n\nAfter the end credits, the player now has control of Gordon at the end of ''Episode 2,'' albeit with the changed events caused by the G-Man. Eli is furious that Alyx has disappeared, and knows that it must be the G-Man that has taken her. The G-Man can in fact be seen watching events from a balcony at the side of the room, unbeknownst to Eli. Dog jumps in through the window behind him and holds out Gordon's crowbar in his hand. Eli takes it, hands it to Gordon and says \"we've got work to do.\"\n\n==Reception==\nGordon Freeman quickly became and then remained one of the most popular video game characters ever.

The battle resulted from a complex plan created by Cuban General Cantillo to directly attack Castro's mountain base in the [[Sierra Maestra]]. The battle ended with the humiliating surrender of the assault battalion and the loss of some 500 Cuban army soldiers (killed, wounded, and captured).\n[[Image:Cuba Rev3.jpg|Cuban Revolution 1958|thumb|200px|left|Map showing key locations of the Cuban Revolution, 1958]]\n\n==Background==\nGeneral Cantillo's plan was to bring a direct attack on Castro's base in the Sierra Maestra. Earlier attacks into the hills from the north and east had failed miserably, as the attackers had run into ambushes and minefields. \n\nThis attack would be different, a surprise amphibious assault from the sea by Cuban army Battalion 18, under the command of Major Jose Quevedo. Once Battalion 18 had landed, Battalion 17 was to move into the Sierra Maestra and attack Castro's base from the north.\n\n==The battle==\nThe landing took place on the 11 July 1958, at La Plata, a tiny village where La Plata river reaches the sea. The landing-party came ashore successfully and the battalion headed in towards the mountains. Castro's forces took positions on either side of the advancing soldiers and suddenly attacked. Within half an hour, Battalion 18 was surrounded and under attack from all directions. The Cuban soldiers proceeded to dig trenches and then waited for help.\n\nGeneral Cantillo ordered 200 men that had been held in reserve to land at a nearby beach west of [[La Plata]] so they could attack Castro's guerrillas from behind. But this sea attack was driven off by machine gun fire and so, the reserves ended up landing at La Plata behind Battalion 18 where they could do nothing useful.\n\nNext, Battalion 17 was ordered to attack into the hills. Once again, a small detachment of Castro's skilled guerrillas stopped the move by the Cuban army into the Sierra Maestra by using road blocks, mines, and sniper fire.\n\nMeanwhile, Castro tried to convince the commander of the surrounded Battalion 18 to surrender, using propaganda broadcasts over loudspeakers and personal letters. Major Jose Fernando Quevedo, though a former classmate of Castro, resisted the call to surrender for days. Finally, on the 21st of July Quevedo surrendered his command.\n\n==Results of the battle==\nBattalion 18 lost 71 of its men killed and wounded during the course of the battle. The rest, some 240 men, surrendered. All told, Castro's troops captured some 400 Cuban Army soldiers (although they later turned them over to the Red Cross) along with hundreds of weapons and nearly a ton of ammunition.\n\nThe battle demonstrated, yet again, the virtual inability of Batista's Cuban Army to launch an attack. Even when surrounded and under fire, the Cuban soldiers of Battalion 18 did nothing more than hold their position and wait for someone else to help them. With the lives of their fellow soldiers on the line, Battalion 17 staged an ineffective attack into the mountains and then stopped. The end of the battle left Battalion 17 halted south of Las Mercedes lake in the mountains. Their withdrawal would lead to the [[Battle of Las Mercedes]] (29 July-8 August 1958).\n\nMajor Jose F. Quevedo stayed with Castro and eventually switched sides, joining with Castro and working against the Batista government. He later wrote two books (published in Cuba) about the battle and the last six months of the revolution.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of Las Mercedes]] 29 July-8 August 1958\n*[[Battle of Yaguajay]] 19\u201330 December 1958\n\n==Sources==\n{{no footnotes|date=November 2014}}\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/BLJ.htm The Spirit Of Moncada] by Larry Bockman (Major, USMC) 1984.\n* [http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/jigue.htm Battle of Jig\u00fce] by Terrence Cannon\n* [http://www.themilitant.com/1996/604/604_16.html Interview with Colonel Quevedo] published in The Militant (a Communist journal), 1996.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{coord missing|Cuba}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle Of La Plata}}\n[[Category:Cuban Revolution]]\n[[Category:1958 in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1958]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Military action during the Cuban revolution}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of La Plata\n| partof      = ''[[Operation Verano]]'' and the [[Cuban Revolution]]\n| date        = 11-21 July 1958\n| place       = [[Sierra Maestra]] hills, [[Cuba]]\n| result      = Rebel victory\n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|Cuba}} [[Republic of Cuba]]\n| combatant2  = [[File:M-26-7.svg|22px|23px]] [[26th of July Movement]]\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Cuba}} Gen.
