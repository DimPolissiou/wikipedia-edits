The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. Inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the band [[British Sea Power]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with it being named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications and winning numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developed a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]] who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/> which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as an upcoming 2017 game under the title ''No Truce With the Furies'',<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> taken from the poem \"Reflections\" by [[R.S. Thomas]] and published in Thomas' ''No Truce with the Furies'' in 1995.<ref name=\"egm title\"/>\n\nWork on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised England was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. Inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the band [[British Sea Power]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with it being named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications and winning numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developed a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]] who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/> which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as an upcoming 2017 game under the title ''No Truce With the Furies'',<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> taken from the poem \"Reflections\" by [[R.S. Thomas]] and published in Thomas' ''No Truce with the Furies'' in 1995.<ref name=\"egm title\"/>\n\nWork on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised the city was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

Many of his earlier poems clearly express opposition to Japanese rule, and after Korea\u2019s liberation in 1945 he voiced his disquiet at the political polarisation that was tearing the country apart. When the growing unrest came to threaten the life of his family, he moved to [[Seoul]], where he died as the result of a shrapnel wound to the stomach during the [[Korean War]].\n\n==Writing==\n[[File:Poem monument of Kim Yeong-nang Gangjin South Korea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Monument to the poet at his old home]]\nUnder the [[penname]] Yeongrang, Kim Yeong-nang was especially active in literature during the 1930s and 1940s.

In some places and times, such as during the [[Spanish American wars of independence|wars of independence]], ''peninsulares'' were called deprecatively ''godos'' (meaning ''Goths'', referring to the \"[[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]]\", who had ruled Spain) or, in [[Mexico]], ''gachupines''<ref name=\"DRAE\">[https://dle.rae.es/?id=IgwbtzF gachup\u00edn] in the [[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]</ref> or ''[[gaucho]]s''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} ''Godos'' is still used in the Canary Islands for the peninsular Spanish.\n\nColonial officials at the highest levels arrived from Spain to fulfill their duty to govern [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies in [[Latin America]] and the Philippines. Often, the ''peninsulares'' possessed large quantities of land. They defended [[C\u00e1diz]]'s monopoly on trade, upsetting the ''criollos'', who turned to contraband with [[Great Britain|British]] and [[France|French]] colonies, especially in areas away from the main ports of call for the ''[[Spanish treasure fleet|Flota de Indias]]''. They worked to preserve Spanish power and sometimes acted as agents of patrol.\n\nIn a colonial social hierarchy, the ''peninsulares'' were nominally at the top, followed by ''criollos'', who developed a fully entrenched powerful local aristocracy in the 17th and the 18th centuries. During the [[French Revolution]], the ''peninsulares'' were generally conservative.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Isle\u00f1os]]\n*[[Dominant minority]]\n*[[List of viceroys of New Spain]]\n*[[List of Viceroys of Peru]]\n*[[List of Viceroys of New Granada]]\n*[[List of Governors in the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in the Americas]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Latin America]]\n[[Category:Latin American caste system]]\n[[Category:Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n[[Category:White Latin American]]\n", "name_user": "Juanmakabulos", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsulars"}

In 1954 that function was transferred to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now known as the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]), and it is now known as the [[Indian Health Service]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Organization==\nLocated in [[Washington,&nbsp;D.C.]], the BIA is headed by a bureau director who reports to the assistant secretary for Indian affairs. The current assistant secretary is [[Tara Sweeney]].\n\nThe BIA oversees 573 [[federally recognized tribes]] through 4 offices:\n\n* Office of Indian Services: operates the BIA\u2019s general assistance, disaster relief, Indian child welfare, tribal government, Indian self-determination, and [[Indian Reservation Roads Program]].\n* Office of Justice Services (OJS): directly operates or funds law enforcement, tribal courts, and detention facilities on federal Indian lands. OJS funded 208&nbsp;law enforcement agencies, consisting of 43 BIA-operated [[BIA Police|police]] agencies, and 165&nbsp;tribally operated agencies under contract, or compact with the OJS. The office has seven areas of activity: Criminal Investigations and Police Services, Detention/Corrections, Inspection/Internal Affairs, Tribal Law Enforcement and Special Initiatives, the Indian Police Academy, Tribal Justice Support, and Program Management. The OJS also provides oversight and technical assistance to tribal law enforcement programs when and where requested. It operates four divisions: Corrections, Drug Enforcement, the [[Indian Police Academy]], and Law Enforcement.<ref>[http://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/OJS/index.htm \"Who We Are\"], BIA</ref>\n* Office of Trust Services: works with tribes and individual American Indians and Alaska Natives in the management of their trust lands, assets, and resources.\n* The Office of Field Operations: oversees 12&nbsp;regional offices; Alaska, Great Plains, Northwest, Southern Plains, Eastern, Navajo, Pacific, Southwest, Eastern Oklahoma, Midwest, Rocky Mountain, and Western; and 83&nbsp;agencies, which carry out the mission of the bureau at the tribal level.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ely S.

By 1806 the Congress had created a '''Superintendent of Indian Trade''', or \"'''Office of Indian Trade'''\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofnorthamer00wald|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-8160-6858-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofnorthamer00wald/page/236 236]|quote=in 1806, an Office of Indian Trade was created within the War Department|title=Atlas of the North American Indian|publisher=Infobase Publishing|last1=Waldman|first1=Carl|last2=Braun|first2=Molly|year=2009}}</ref> within the War Department, who was charged with maintaining the [[Factory (trading post)#North American factories .281697 to 1822.29|factory]] trading network of the [[fur trade]]. The post was held by [[Thomas L. McKenney]] from 1816 until the abolition of the factory system in 1822.\n\nThe government licensed traders to have some control in Indian territories and gain a share of the lucrative trade.\n\n=== Bureau of Indian Affairs (1824\u2013present) ===\nThe abolition of the [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] system left a vacuum within the U.S.&nbsp;government regarding Native American relations. The '''Bureau of Indian Affairs''' was formed on March 11, 1824, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]], who created the agency as a division within his department, without authorization from the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the Bureau of Indian affairs and Its Activities Among Indians|last=Jackson|first=Curtis|publisher=R & E Research|year=1997|isbn=|location=San Francisco, California|pages=43}}</ref> He appointed McKenney as the first head of the office, which went by several names. McKenney preferred to call it the \"'''Indian Office'''\", whereas the current name was preferred by Calhoun.\n\n=== The Removal Era (1830\u20131850) ===\nThe BIA's goal to protect domestic and dependent nations, was reaffirmed by the 1831 court case [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]. The Supreme Court originally refused to hear the case, because the Cherokee nation was not an independent state and could not litigate in the federal court. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sixty Years of Indian Affairs|last=Harmon|first=George Dewey|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=New York|pages=174-196}}</ref> It was not until the court case [[Worcester v. Georgia]], when Chief Justice John Marshall allowed Native American tribes to be recognized as \"domestic dependent nations.\" These court cases set precedent for future treaties, as more Native tribes were recognized as domestic and dependent nations. <ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of The Bureau of Indian Affairs And It's Activities Among Indians|last=Jackson|first=Curtis|publisher=R & E Research Associates|year=1977|isbn=|location=San Francisco, California|pages=59}}</ref>\n\nThis period was encompassed by westward expansion and the removal of Native Nations. In 1833 Georgians fought for the removal of the Cherokee Nation from the state of Georgia. Despite the rulings of Worcester v. Georgia, President Monroe and John C. Calhoun created a plan for removal. The removal of the Cherokee Nation occurred in 1838 and was accompanied by the Treaty of 1846. When reparations from the treaty were unfulfilled, the Senate Committee on the Indian Affairs made the final settlement in 1850. This settlement, \"supported the position of the Cherokee that the cost of maintaining the tribesman during their removal and the years upkeep after their arrival West should be paid by the federal government, and the expense of the removal agents should be paid as well.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1832 Congress established the position of '''Commissioner of Indian Affairs'''. In 1849 Indian Affairs was transferred to the U.S.&nbsp;Department of the Interior. In 1869, [[Ely S. Parker|Ely Samuel Parker]] was the first Native American to be appointed as commissioner of Indian affairs.\n\n=== Assimilation (1890\u20131930) ===\nOne of the most controversial policies of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was the late&nbsp;19th to early 20th&nbsp;century decision to educate native children in separate [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]], such as the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]]. With an emphasis on assimilation that prohibited them from using their indigenous languages, practices, and cultures, these schools educated to European-American culture.<ref>Dennis Banks, \"Ojibwa Warrior,\" 2004: 29\u201328</ref> Another example of assimilation and Euro-American control was the Bureau of Indian Affairs tribal police force.

A settlement fund totaling $3.4&nbsp;billion is to be distributed to class members.

It is responsible for the administration and management of {{convert|55700000|acre|km2|sigfig=3}} of land held [[Trust law|in trust]] by the United States for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[List of federally recognized tribes|Indian Tribes]] and [[Alaska Natives]].\n\nThe BIA is one of two bureaus under the jurisdiction of the assistant secretary for Indian affairs: the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the [[Bureau of Indian Education]], which provides education services to approximately 48,000&nbsp;Native Americans.\n\nThe BIA\u2019s responsibilities originally included providing health care to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives]]. In 1954 that function was transferred to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now known as the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]), and it is now known as the [[Indian Health Service]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Organization==\nLocated in [[Washington,&nbsp;D.C.]], the BIA is headed by a bureau director who reports to the assistant secretary for Indian affairs. The current assistant secretary is [[Tara Sweeney]].\n\nThe BIA oversees 573 [[federally recognized tribes]] through 4 offices:\n\n* Office of Indian Services: operates the BIA\u2019s general assistance, disaster relief, Indian child welfare, tribal government, Indian self-determination, and [[Indian Reservation Roads Program]].\n* Office of Justice Services (OJS): directly operates or funds law enforcement, tribal courts, and detention facilities on federal Indian lands. OJS funded 208&nbsp;law enforcement agencies, consisting of 43 BIA-operated [[BIA Police|police]] agencies, and 165&nbsp;tribally operated agencies under contract, or compact with the OJS. The office has seven areas of activity: Criminal Investigations and Police Services, Detention/Corrections, Inspection/Internal Affairs, Tribal Law Enforcement and Special Initiatives, the Indian Police Academy, Tribal Justice Support, and Program Management. The OJS also provides oversight and technical assistance to tribal law enforcement programs when and where requested. It operates four divisions: Corrections, Drug Enforcement, the [[Indian Police Academy]], and Law Enforcement.<ref>[http://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/OJS/index.htm \"Who We Are\"], BIA</ref>\n* Office of Trust Services: works with tribes and individual American Indians and Alaska Natives in the management of their trust lands, assets, and resources.\n* The Office of Field Operations: oversees 12&nbsp;regional offices; Alaska, Great Plains, Northwest, Southern Plains, Eastern, Navajo, Pacific, Southwest, Eastern Oklahoma, Midwest, Rocky Mountain, and Western; and 83&nbsp;agencies, which carry out the mission of the bureau at the tribal level.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ely S.

By 1806 the Congress had created a '''Superintendent of Indian Trade''', or \"'''Office of Indian Trade'''\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofnorthamer00wald|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-8160-6858-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofnorthamer00wald/page/236 236]|quote=in 1806, an Office of Indian Trade was created within the War Department|title=Atlas of the North American Indian|publisher=Infobase Publishing|last1=Waldman|first1=Carl|last2=Braun|first2=Molly|year=2009}}</ref> within the War Department, who was charged with maintaining the [[Factory (trading post)#North American factories .281697 to 1822.29|factory]] trading network of the [[fur trade]]. The post was held by [[Thomas L. McKenney]] from 1816 until the abolition of the factory system in 1822.\n\nThe government licensed traders to have some control in Indian territories and gain a share of the lucrative trade.\n\n=== Bureau of Indian Affairs (1824\u2013present) ===\nThe abolition of the [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] system left a vacuum within the U.S.&nbsp;government regarding Native American relations. The '''Bureau of Indian Affairs''' was formed on March 11, 1824, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]], who created the agency as a division within his department, without authorization from the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the Bureau of Indian affairs and It's Activities Among Insians|last=Jackson|first=Curtis|publisher=R & E Research|year=1997|isbn=|location=San Francisco, California|pages=43}}</ref> He appointed McKenney as the first head of the office, which went by several names. McKenney preferred to call it the \"'''Indian Office'''\", whereas the current name was preferred by Calhoun.\n\n=== The Removal Era (1830\u20131850) ===\nThe BIA's goal to protect domestic and dependent nations, was reaffirmed by the 1831 court case [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]. The Supreme Court originally refused to hear the case, because the Cherokee nation was not an independent state and could not litigate in the federal court. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sixty Years of Indian Affairs|last=Harmon|first=George Dewey|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=New York|pages=174-196}}</ref> It was not until the court case [[Worcester v. Georgia]], when Chief Justice John Marshall allowed Native American tribes to be recognized as \"domestic dependent nations.\" These court cases set precedent for future treaties, as more Native tribes were recognized as domestic and dependent nations. <ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of The Bureau of Indian Affairs And It's Activities Among Indians|last=Jackson|first=Curtis|publisher=R & E Research Associates|year=1977|isbn=|location=San Francisco, California|pages=59}}</ref>\n\nThis period was encompassed by westward expansion and the removal of Native Nations. In 1833 Georgians fought for the removal of the Cherokee Nation from the state of Georgia. Despite the rulings of Worcester v. Georgia, President Monroe and John C. Calhoun created a plan for removal. The removal of the Cherokee Nation occurred in 1838 and was accompanied by the Treaty of 1846. When reparations from the treaty were unfulfilled, the Senate Committee on the Indian Affairs made the final settlement in 1850. This settlement, \"supported the position of the Cherokee that the cost of maintaining the tribesman during their removal and the years upkeep after their arrival West should be paid by the federal government, and the expense of the removal agents should be paid as well.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1832 Congress established the position of '''Commissioner of Indian Affairs'''. In 1849 Indian Affairs was transferred to the U.S.&nbsp;Department of the Interior. In 1869, [[Ely S. Parker|Ely Samuel Parker]] was the first Native American to be appointed as commissioner of Indian affairs.\n\n=== Assimilation (1890\u20131930) ===\nOne of the most controversial policies of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was the late&nbsp;19th to early 20th&nbsp;century decision to educate native children in separate [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]], such as the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]]. With an emphasis on assimilation that prohibited them from using their indigenous languages, practices, and cultures, these schools educated to European-American culture.<ref>Dennis Banks, \"Ojibwa Warrior,\" 2004: 29\u201328</ref> Another example of assimilation and Euro-American control was the Bureau of Indian Affairs tribal police force. This was designed by its agents  to decrease the power of American Indian leaders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Native Americans and Public Policy|last=Lyden|first=Fremont|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Pittsburgh|pages=23-41}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Indians at work magazine july 1940 navajo lasso native americans cowboy.jpg|thumb|left|1940 ''Indians at Work'' magazine, published by the Office of Indian Affairs, predecessor agency to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.]]\nThe bureau was renamed from '''Office of Indian Affairs''' to '''Bureau of Indian Affairs''' in 1947.\n\nWith the rise of American Indian [[activism]] in the 1960s and 1970s and increasing demands for enforcement of treaty rights and sovereignty, the 1970s were a particularly turbulent period of BIA history.<ref>Philip Worchel, Philip G.

This was a class-action lawsuit regarding the federal government's management and accounting of more than 300,000 individual American Indian and Alaska Native trust accounts. A settlement fund totaling $3.4&nbsp;billion is to be distributed to class members. This is to compensate for claims that prior U.S.&nbsp;officials had mismanaged the administration of Indian trust assets. In addition, the settlement establishes a $2&nbsp;billion fund enabling federally recognized tribes to voluntarily buy back and consolidate fractionated land interests.<ref>\u201cCobell vs. Salazar Lawsuit\u201d. doi.gov/tribes/special-trustee.cfm. Office of Special Trustee, n.d. Web. April 24, 2011</ref>\n\n==Mission==\nThe bureau is currently trying to evolve from a supervisory to an advisory role. However, this has been a difficult task as the BIA is known by many Indians as playing a police role in which the U.S.&nbsp;government historically dictated to tribes and their members what they could and could not do in accordance with treaties signed by both.<ref>{{cite web|author=author |url=http://www.americansc.org.uk/Online/indians.htm |title=From War to Self-Determination: the Bureau of Indian Affairs |publisher=Americansc.org.uk |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Commissioners and Assistant Secretaries==\nCommissioners and Assistant Secretaries of Indian Affairs include:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://rulers.org/usgovt.html |title=U.S. government departments and offices, etc |publisher=Rulers.org |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Heads of the Bureau of Indian Affairs===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* 1822-1824 [[William Clark]]\n* 1824\u20131830 [[Thomas L.
