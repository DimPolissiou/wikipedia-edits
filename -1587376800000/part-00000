As such, it is sometimes used to represent a mix of different ideologies, or new protest movements that are critical of all previously-existing parties.\n* Purple is often associated with [[feminism]] and when combined with black, is often used to represent [[anarcha-feminism]].\n* In Albania, purple is associated with the governing [[Socialist Party of Albania]], a [[centre-left]] party\n* In Brazil, purple is the color associated with some [[Progressive liberalism|progressive liberal]] movements such as  [[Cidadania]] and [[Livres (movement)|Livres]]. This color is chosen because those movements consider themselves to be mixing the best ideas of the [[left-wing politics|left]] (associated with red) and the [[right-wing politics|right]] (associated with blue)\n*In Canada, navy purple is the colour used by the right-wing [[People's Party of Canada]].\n* Purple is the colour of [[TOP 09]], a [[liberal conservative]] party in [[Czech Republic]]\n* In Europe, purple tends to be used for movements, parties and governments that are neither clearly right nor left.\n** It has been used to represent the [[Purple (government)|Purple governments]] of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], formed by an alliance of red social-democratic and blue liberal parties.\n** The pan-European movement [[Volt Europa]] has adopted purple as its main party colour since its foundation, symbolising dynamic youthfulness and transparency.\n* In Italy, purple has been adopted by anti-[[Silvio Berlusconi]] protesters (see [[Purple People]]) as an alternative from other colours and political parties.\n* In Ireland, purple is the colour of the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]] which supports a [[Nordic model]] of social democracy.\n* In Mexico, purple is the colour of the [[Humanist Party (Mexico)|Humanist Party]].\n* In Poland, purple is the colour of [[Razem|Partia Razem]], a new left-wing social-democratic political party formed in 2015.\n* In Romania, purple was used by the populist and eurosceptic [[People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu]], active between 2011\u20132015.\n* In Spain, purple is the colour of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], a left-wing party that emerged from the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M Movement]] protests.\n* Purple is the colour of the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] and Icelandic [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], as well as several [[List of Pirate Parties|international Pirate parties]] share the colour along with black. \n* In the United Kingdom, purple is associated with Euroscepticism, being the official colours of the [[UK Independence Party]] (along with yellow) and the minor party [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]].\n* In the United States, purple is the official colour of [[centrism]], the [[American Independent Party]], a \"[[swing state]]\", the [[Veterans Party of America]], and the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]\n** Also the color of social democratic [[Vermont Progressive Party]].{{Dubious||date=July 2019}}\n** Purple is also unofficially used in the United States to denote a \"swing state\" (i.e. one contested frequently between the Republican Party, whose unofficial colour is red; and the Democratic Party, whose unofficial colour is blue). Purple is also used by [[centrism|centrists]] to represent a combination of beliefs belonging to the Republicans (red) and the Democrats (blue). It has also been used to reference [[Purple America]], a term used in contrast to \"blue\" or \"red\", noting the electoral differences nationwide are observed more on discrepancies instead of unity (see [[red states and blue states]]).\n* In Uruguay, purple is the colour of the social democratic [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].\n* In Venezuela, purple is use by socialist [[People's Electoral Movement (Venezuela)|People's Electoral Movement]].\n\n== Red ==\n[[Red]] is traditionally associated with [[socialism]] and [[communism]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The oldest symbol of socialism (and by extension communism) is the [[Red flag (politics)|Red Flag]], which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Before this nascence, the colour red was generally associated with [[monarchy]] or the Church due to the symbolism and association of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s blood. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations\u2014including the [[First International|First]], [[Second International|Second]], [[Comintern|Third]] and [[Fourth International|Fourth]] Internationals\u2014used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.\n\n* In Europe and Latin America, red is also associated with parties of [[social democracy]] and often their allies within the [[labour movement]]. Sometimes these parties use pink instead, as a \"moderate\" colour instead of the more \"radical\" red, or \"pink\" used to describe the more moderate faction or membership within a left-wing party.\n* Red is also the traditional colour of liberal parties in Latin America and was the colour use, for example, in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay for liberal parties. However, these parties follow [[social liberalism]] more than [[classic liberalism]], thus seating in the centre-left. \n* In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, red is also the colour of the labour movement and the Labour (spelled Labor in Australia) parties in those countries. The use of red as a symbol is referenced in the British Labour Party's anthem, ''[[The Red Flag]]''.<ref name=\"Hitchens2010\">{{cite book|author=Peter Hitchens|title=The Cameron Delusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA181|date=26 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-2390-9|page=181}}</ref>\n** In the heyday of the British Empire before 1960, maps, globes, and atlases typically used red or pink to designate the [[British Empire]] or its Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Jay Klinghoffer|title=The Power of Projections: How Maps Reflect Global Politics and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|page=79|isbn=9780275991357}}</ref> As soon as a colony became independent, it needed its own distinctive color and the practice died out.\n* In [[Brazil]], red is so strongly associated with the [[left-wing populist]] [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], the communists [[PCdoB]] and [[Brazilian Communist Party|PCB]] and with the [[far-left]] that different left-wing movements choose not to use red as a main color in order to give themselves a distinct identity. The [[PSOL]] and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]] invert the traditional color schemes of left-wing political parties and use red as a secondary color with yellow, orange or white being their primary color. [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] uses blue, red, pink and white as main colors.\n* Also in Brazil, red combined with black and white was formerly associated with [[Brazilian nationalism]]. The first incarnation of the [[agrarianist]]-[[centrist]] [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]], both incarnations of the Brazilian Labour Party (the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|first]] a [[social democratic]] party, the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|current]] a [[populist]] one) and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] use this color scheme. Red, Black and White are associated with the three races which form the ethnic composition of Brazil: the [[Amerindians]] (Red), the [[Afro-Brazilians]] (Black) and [[White Brazilians]].\n* Belize's main conservative party ([[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]) is represented by the red colour.\n* In Canada, red has always been associated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] because one of its predecessors was the ''[[Parti rouge]]'' (French for \"Red Party\").\n* Japan's [[buddhist]] party [[Komeito]] has a red sun as flag. \n* The [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] of Paraguay, a right-wing conservative party, uses red while its main rival the liberal [[Radical Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Partido Liberal Radical]] uses blue, contrary to the rest of Latin America.\n* The [[Liberty Korea Party]], which was the dominant [[Conservatism in South Korea|conservative]] party in [[South Korea]], used red as their official colour. Before 2012, the conservative parties used blue as their official colour.\n* In [[Spain]] red is associated with communism, socialism and social democracy. The social democrat party [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] and the leftist coalition [[United Left (Spain)|Izquierda Unida]] use red.\n* In [[Sweden]] red is associated with leftism, socialism and social democracy. The [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] use red.\n* In [[Slovakia]], red is the colour of [[SMER-SD|Social Democrats]], along with Green and also the colour of the new liberal party [[Progressive Slovakia]], along with Cyan and Purple\n* In Thailand, the Red Shirt movement derives its populist base from amongst the working class and rural communities, which oppose the established power elite in Bangkok.\n* In [[Uruguay]], the centrist [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] uses red. Colorado means reddish in Spanish\n* A key exception to the convention of red to mean socialism is the United States. Since about the year 2000, the mass media have associated red with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], despite the fact that the Republican Party is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party (see [[red states and blue states]]).<ref name=\"David Starkey 2007\"/> This use is probably entrenched as many political organisations (for example the website [[RedState]]) now use the term. Any use of the color red exclusively to describe historically the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] on anything prior to 2000 would be historically inaccurate and misleading.\n** By contrast, in Puerto Rico the liberal [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] uses red.\n\n== Saffron ==\n* In India, [[Saffron (color)|saffron]] is traditionally associated with [[Hinduism]], [[Hindutva]] and the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist movement]].<ref name=\"Saffron\">{{cite book|title=Manufacturing Citizenship: education and nationalism in Europe, South Asia and China|author=V\u00e9ronique B\u00e9n\u00e9\u00ef|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36488-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XCUNB8koN-8C&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=Saffronization}}</ref> Saffron was chosen because in Hindu [[Sanatana Dharma]], the deep saffron colour is associated with sacrifice, religious abstinence, quest for light and salvation. Saffron or \"Bhagwa\" is the most sacred colour for the Hindus and is often worn by Sanyasis who have left their home in search of the ultimate truth.\n\n== Turquoise ==\n[[Turquoise]] has, in recent years, been associated with [[Euroscepticism]] as a result of several European parties that have proposed their respective nation's exit from the [[European Union]].\n*In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Turquoise]] became the color of choice of the eurosceptic [[Brexit Party]].\n*In the European Union, the [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] group uses turquoise as its principle colour. Before them, this colour was used by the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] group.\n* In Brazil, Turquoise is used as the main color of [[Rede Sustentabilidade|Sustaintability Network]], a progressive political party\n\n== White ==\n[[White]] is today mainly linked to [[pacifism]] (as in the [[White flag|surrender flag]])<ref name=\":0\" /> and in politics of the United Kingdom to independent politicians such as [[Martin Bell]].\n\n* Historically, it was associated with support for [[absolute monarchy]], starting with the supporters of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] of France because it was the dynasty's colour. Later it was used by the [[White movement|Whites]] who fought against the communist \"Reds\" in the [[Russian Civil War]], because some of the Russian \"Whites\" had similar goals to the French \"Whites\" of a century earlier (although, it is worth noting that the Whites included many different people with many ideologies, such as monarchists, liberals, and others).\n** Because of its use by anti-communist forces in Russia, the colour white came to be associated in the 20th century with many different [[anti-communist]] and counter-revolutionary groups, even those that did not support absolute monarchy (for example, the Finnish \"[[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]\" who fought against the socialist \"[[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]]\" in the civil war following the [[independence of Finland]]). In some revolutions, red is used to represent the revolutionaries and white is used to represent the supporters of the old order, regardless of the ideologies or goals of the two sides.\n* In Italy a red cross on a white shield (''scudo crociato'') is the emblem of Catholic parties from the historical [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party.\n* In [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] reversed the Islamist schema, using black shahada on a white background (symbol of purity).\n* In [[Singapore]], white is the colour associated with the [[People's Action Party]], the party that has been in power and dominating the Parliament since the country's independence.\n* In Uruguay, the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] is also known as \"White Party\", counterpart of the liberal \"[[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Red Party]]\" during the [[two-party system|two-party era]].\n* In [[Venezuela]], white has been the traditional colour of the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] party, one of the two parties that dominated the country's politics in the late 20th century (alongside [[Copei]]) and one of the parties currently in opposition to the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]].\n\n== Yellow ==\n[[Yellow]] used to be the colour most commonly associated with [[liberalism]] and [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Color Design Workbook: A Real World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design|last=Adams|first=Sean|last2=Morioka|first2=Noreen|last3=Stone|first3=Terry Lee|date=2006|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=159253192X|location=Gloucester, Mass.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86 86]|oclc=60393965|url=https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Rohit Vishal|last2=Joshi|first2=Radhika|date=October\u2013December 2006|title=Colour, Colour Everywhere: In Marketing Too|journal=SCMS Journal of Indian Management|volume=3|issue=4|pages=40\u201346|issn=0973-3167|ssrn=969272}}</ref><ref>Cassel-Picot, Muriel \"The Liberal Democrats and the Green Cause: From Yellow to Green\" in Leydier, Gilles and Martin, Alexia (2013) ''Environmental Issues in Political Discourse in Britain and Ireland''.

For instance, in [[Thailand]] yellow represents [[Monarchy of Thailand|King]] [[Bhumibol]]. It was also the colour of the pro-monarchy [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system in the [[Kingdom of Nepal]].\n* It is also a common colour to represent [[Buddhism]], monks in [[Burma]] used it in the [[Saffron Revolution|anti-government protests]].\n* In Argentina, yellow is the colour for liberal right-wing party [[Republican Proposal]], led by [[Mauricio Macri]].\n* In [[Brazil]], yellow, combined with green, is associated with right-wing movements [[anti-corruption|against corruption]], anti-[[Workers Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]], supportive of [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and later, with support of [[Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign, 2018|Jair Bolsonaro]], like [[Partido Social Liberal|PSL]] and the [[Alliance for Brazil]]. The association came because many of the protesters against Dilma wears the jersey of [[Brazilian national football team]], which is yellow with the numbers and some details in green, and because the protesters chanted that [[brazilian flag]] \"will never be red\" and \"will be always green and yellow\". Red is the color of [[left-wing populist]] Workers' Party.\n* In Colombia, yellow is the colour of left-wing party [[Alternative Democratic Pole]].\n* In Costa Rica, yellow is the colour associated with the social democratic and progressive [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] (generally under a darker gold tone) and left-wing [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] (which uses a more lighter tone). It is also the colour of several [[Worker's union|unions]].\n* In [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], yellow is the colour of the [[christian democratic]] parties [[KDU-CSL]] and [[Christian Democratic Movement]], respectively.\n* In [[Denmark]], yellow is the colour of the right-wing populist [[Danish People's Party]].\n* In Honduras, yellow is the colour of far-left party [[Democratic Unification Party]].\n* In Hong Kong, yellow refers to democracy because of the yellow umbrellas that were raised during the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014.\n* In Malaysia, yellow was used by [[Bersih]] (The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections), a series of rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Malaysians. \n* In the Philippines, yellow mostly refers to the [[People Power Revolution]], [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], and the [[Aquino family]]. \n* In [[Sweden]], the [[Sweden Democrats]], a nationalistic and socially conservative party, is often associated with yellow.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n* In [[Uruguay]], the [[national conservative]] [[Open Cabildo (Uruguay)|Cabildo Abierto]] uses yellow\n* In the European Union, the color yellow was used by the [[ALDE Party]], its [[ALDE Group|group in the European Parliament]] and its youth organation before dropping it in 2016.\n*In the United Kingdom, the color yellow is the official colour of the center-left pro-Scottish independence [[Scottish National Party]].\n* In the United States, the color yellow was the official color of the suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Kathleen  L.

The second largest party and the main opposition, the conservative [[United Future Party]] uses pink.\n* In [[Politics of Sweden|Sweden]], blue is used for the centre-right [[Moderate Party]] and liberal [[Liberals (Sweden)|Liberals]], while red is used for the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], and socialist [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]]. Green is used by the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]] and the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]]. The far-right [[Sweden Democrats]] uses yellow.\n* In [[Politics of the Republic of China|Taiwan]], the leading groups of parties are the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]], which leans more towards Chinese nationalism and the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], which leans more towards Taiwanese independence. The [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] uses yellow as its party colour even though its policies are conservative; the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] uses green even though its international alignment is with the [[Liberal International]] and not the Green parties.\n* In the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (excluding Northern Ireland), the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] uses blue, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] uses red and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] use gold and orange. The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] uses green. The [[Brexit Party]] uses turquoise and white.

This was common in British politics up to the 1970s. The traditional colour of the [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]] Conservatives was yellow, rather than dark blue, even in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] Conservative candidates in Penrith and the neighbouring constituency of [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] wore blue and yellow rosettes. In [[North East England]], the Conservatives traditionally used red, Labour green and the Liberals blue and orange. In parts of [[East Anglia]], the Conservatives used pink and blue, whilst in [[Norwich]] their colours were orange and purple. The Liberals and Conservatives used blue and red respectively in [[West Wales]], while in parts of [[Cheshire]] the Liberals were red and Labour yellow. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Tories used orange in [[Birmingham]], pink in [[Whitby]] and red in [[East Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Worcestershire]], whilst the Whigs were blue in [[Kendal]], purple in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and orange in [[Wakefield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32510493|title=The seats where Tories weren't blue and Labour wasn't red|author=Jon Kelly|date=4 May 2015|website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> The traditional colour of the [[Warwickshire]] Liberals was green, rather than orange.\n* In the [[Politics of the United States|United States]] the two major political parties use the [[national colours]], i.e. red, white and blue. Historically, the only common situation in which it has been necessary to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results. In such cases, there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours. However, in the weeks following the 2000 election there arose the terminology of [[red states and blue states]], in which the conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was associated with red and the liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with blue. Political observers latched on to this association, which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network. In 2004, the association was mostly kept. As of November 2012, maps for presidential elections produced by the U.S. government also use blue for Democrats and red for Republicans.<ref name=\"US-NARA-map\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/map/historic.html|title=Historic Election Results|publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref> In September 2010, the Democratic Party officially adopted an all-blue logo.<ref name=\"democrats.org\"/> Around the same time, the official Republican website began using a red logo.\n** This association has potential to confuse foreign observers in that, as described above, red is traditionally a left-wing colour, while blue is typically associated with right-wing politics. This is further complicated by the diversity of [[Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)|factions in the Democratic Party]] ranging from conservatives to right-libertarians to [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] alongside the dominant centrist and social liberal elements of the party that outside the United States often each use different political colors. \n**The conservative [[Blue Dog Coalition]] within the Democratic Party adopted the color blue at its founding before the 2000 election solidified the red-blue convention. \n** There is some historical use of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans: in the late 19th century and early 20th century, [[Texas]] county election boards used colour-coding to help Spanish speakers and illiterates identify the parties,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqrsu|title=Reds and Blues \u2013 The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Tshaonline.org|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> but this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not picked up on a national level. For instance in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] used maps that coded blue for the Republicans, the colour Harrison perceived to represent the Union and \"[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s Party\" and red for the Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tara A.

Orange was the official colour of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] which was the country's governing party from 1948 to 1994.

This gave the colour orange a certain association with radical anti-authoritarian politics in some countries and it has been used as such by groups and organizations in the Middle East, for example in [[Free Patriotic Movement|Lebanon]], the [[Independent Palestine|Palestinian Authority]], [[Kifaya|Egypt]], [[National Democratic Action Society|Bahrain]] and [[Israel]].\n\n== Pink ==\n[[Pink]] is sometimes used by [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as in [[Socialist Party (France)|France]] and [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portugal]]. The more traditional colour of social democracy is red (because social democracy is descended from the democratic socialist movement), but some countries have large social democratic parties alongside large socialist or communist parties, so that it would be confusing for them all to use red. In such cases, social democrats are usually the ones who give up red in favor of a different colour. Pink is often chosen because it is seen as a softer, less aggressive version of red, in the same way that social democracy is more centrist and less militant than socialism. This is also the origin of the colloquial term \"[[pinko]]\".\n*In [[Brazil]], Pink is sometimes used by [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], a [[centre-left]] to [[left-wing nationalist]] political party member of [[Socialist International]].\n* In some European nations and the United States, pink is associated with homosexuality and the pink flag is used as a symbol in support of civil rights for LGBT people. This goes back to the Nazi German policy of appending [[Nazi concentration camp badges|pink triangles]] to the clothing of homosexual prisoners.\n* In [[South Korea]], pink is the color of the conservative [[United Future Party]], founded in 2020 as a merger of the major right-wing [[Free Korea Party]] with some minor conservative parties.\n* Pink is the colour of the feminist party [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]] in Sweden.\n* Pink is the new colour of the socialist [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] party in Finland as well as the [[Feminist Party (Finland)|Feminist Party]].\n\n== Purple ==\nAlthough [[purple]] has some older associations with [[monarchism]], it is the most prominent colour that is not traditionally connected to any major contemporary ideology. As such, it is sometimes used to represent a mix of different ideologies, or new protest movements that are critical of all previously-existing parties.\n* Purple is often associated with [[feminism]] and when combined with black, is often used to represent [[anarcha-feminism]].\n* In Albania, purple is associated with the governing [[Socialist Party of Albania]], a [[centre-left]] party\n* In Brazil, purple is the color associated with some [[Progressive liberalism|progressive liberal]] movements such as  [[Cidadania]] and [[Livres (movement)|Livres]]. This color is chosen because those movements consider themselves to be mixing the best ideas of the [[left-wing politics|left]] (associated with red) and the [[right-wing politics|right]] (associated with blue)\n*In Canada, navy purple is the colour used by the right-wing [[People's Party of Canada]].\n* Purple is the colour of [[TOP 09]], a [[liberal conservative]] party in [[Czech Republic]]\n* In Europe, purple tends to be used for movements, parties and governments that are neither clearly right nor left.\n** It has been used to represent the [[Purple (government)|Purple governments]] of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], formed by an alliance of red social-democratic and blue liberal parties.\n** The pan-European movement [[Volt Europa]] has adopted purple as its main party colour since its foundation, symbolising dynamic youthfulness and transparency.\n* In Italy, purple has been adopted by anti-[[Silvio Berlusconi]] protesters (see [[Purple People]]) as an alternative from other colours and political parties.\n* In Ireland, purple is the colour of the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]] which supports a [[Nordic model]] of social democracy.\n* In Mexico, purple is the colour of the [[Humanist Party (Mexico)|Humanist Party]].\n* In Poland, purple is the colour of [[Razem|Partia Razem]], a new left-wing social-democratic political party formed in 2015.\n* In Romania, purple was used by the populist and eurosceptic [[People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu]], active between 2011\u20132015.\n* In Spain, purple is the colour of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], a left-wing party that emerged from the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M Movement]] protests.\n* Purple is the colour of the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] and Icelandic [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], as well as several [[List of Pirate Parties|international Pirate parties]] share the colour along with black. \n* In the United Kingdom, purple is associated with Euroscepticism, being the official colours of the [[UK Independence Party]] (along with yellow) and the minor party [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]].\n* In the United States, purple is the official colour of [[centrism]], the [[American Independent Party]], a \"[[swing state]]\", the [[Veterans Party of America]], and the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]\n** Also the color of social democratic [[Vermont Progressive Party]].{{Dubious||date=July 2019}}\n** Purple is also unofficially used in the United States to denote a \"swing state\" (i.e. one contested frequently between the Republican Party, whose unofficial colour is red; and the Democratic Party, whose unofficial colour is blue). Purple is also used by [[centrism|centrists]] to represent a combination of beliefs belonging to the Republicans (red) and the Democrats (blue). It has also been used to reference [[Purple America]], a term used in contrast to \"blue\" or \"red\", noting the electoral differences nationwide are observed more on discrepancies instead of unity (see [[red states and blue states]]).\n* In Uruguay, purple is the colour of the social democratic [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].\n* In Venezuela, purple is use by socialist [[People's Electoral Movement (Venezuela)|People's Electoral Movement]].\n\n== Red ==\n[[Red]] is traditionally associated with [[socialism]] and [[communism]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The oldest symbol of socialism (and by extension communism) is the [[Red flag (politics)|Red Flag]], which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Before this nascence, the colour red was generally associated with [[monarchy]] or the Church due to the symbolism and association of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s blood. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations\u2014including the [[First International|First]], [[Second International|Second]], [[Comintern|Third]] and [[Fourth International|Fourth]] Internationals\u2014used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.\n\n* In Europe and Latin America, red is also associated with parties of [[social democracy]] and often their allies within the [[labour movement]]. Sometimes these parties use pink instead, as a \"moderate\" colour instead of the more \"radical\" red, or \"pink\" used to describe the more moderate faction or membership within a left-wing party.\n* Red is also the traditional colour of liberal parties in Latin America and was the colour use, for example, in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay for liberal parties. However, these parties follow [[social liberalism]] more than [[classic liberalism]], thus seating in the centre-left. \n* In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, red is also the colour of the labour movement and the Labour (spelled Labor in Australia) parties in those countries. The use of red as a symbol is referenced in the British Labour Party's anthem, ''[[The Red Flag]]''.<ref name=\"Hitchens2010\">{{cite book|author=Peter Hitchens|title=The Cameron Delusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA181|date=26 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-2390-9|page=181}}</ref>\n** In the heyday of the British Empire before 1960, maps, globes, and atlases typically used red or pink to designate the [[British Empire]] or its Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Jay Klinghoffer|title=The Power of Projections: How Maps Reflect Global Politics and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|page=79|isbn=9780275991357}}</ref> As soon as a colony became independent, it needed its own distinctive color and the practice died out.\n* In [[Brazil]], red is so strongly associated with the [[left-wing populist]] [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], the communists [[PCdoB]] and [[Brazilian Communist Party|PCB]] and with the [[far-left]] that different left-wing movements choose not to use red as a main color in order to give themselves a distinct identity. The [[PSOL]] and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]] invert the traditional color schemes of left-wing political parties and use red as a secondary color with yellow, orange or white being their primary color. [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] uses blue, red, pink and white as main colors.\n* Also in Brazil, red combined with black and white was formerly associated with [[Brazilian nationalism]]. The first incarnation of the [[agrarianist]]-[[centrist]] [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]], both incarnations of the Brazilian Labour Party (the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|first]] a [[social democratic]] party, the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|current]] a [[populist]] one) and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] use this color scheme. Red, Black and White are associated with the three races which form the ethnic composition of Brazil: the [[Amerindians]] (Red), the [[Afro-Brazilians]] (Black) and [[White Brazilians]].\n* Belize's main conservative party ([[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]) is represented by the red colour.\n* In Canada, red has always been associated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] because one of its predecessors was the ''[[Parti rouge]]'' (French for \"Red Party\").\n* Japan's [[buddhist]] party [[Komeito]] has a red sun as flag. \n* The [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] of Paraguay, a right-wing conservative party, uses red while its main rival the liberal [[Radical Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Partido Liberal Radical]] uses blue, contrary to the rest of Latin America.\n* The [[Liberty Korea Party]], which was the dominant [[Conservatism in South Korea|conservative]] party in [[South Korea]], used red as their official colour. Before 2012, the conservative parties used blue as their official colour.\n* In [[Spain]] red is associated with communism, socialism and social democracy. The social democrat party [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] and the leftist coalition [[United Left (Spain)|Izquierda Unida]] use red.\n* In [[Sweden]] red is associated with leftism, socialism and social democracy. The [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] use red.\n* In [[Slovakia]], red is the colour of [[SMER-SD|Social Democrats]], along with Green and also the colour of the new liberal party [[Progressive Slovakia]], along with Cyan and Purple\n* In Thailand, the Red Shirt movement derives its populist base from amongst the working class and rural communities, which oppose the established power elite in Bangkok.\n* In [[Uruguay]], the centrist [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] uses red. Colorado means reddish in Spanish\n* A key exception to the convention of red to mean socialism is the United States. Since about the year 2000, the mass media have associated red with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], despite the fact that the Republican Party is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party (see [[red states and blue states]]).<ref name=\"David Starkey 2007\">{{cite book|author=David Starkey|title=Living Blue in the Red States|publisher=University Press of Nebraska|year=2007}}</ref> This use is probably entrenched as many political organisations (for example the website [[RedState]]) now use the term. Any use of the color red exclusively to describe historically the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] on anything prior to 2000 would be historically inaccurate and misleading.\n** By contrast, in Puerto Rico the liberal [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] uses red.\n\n== Saffron ==\n* In India, [[Saffron (color)|saffron]] is traditionally associated with [[Hinduism]], [[Hindutva]] and the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist movement]].<ref name=\"Saffron\">{{cite book|title=Manufacturing Citizenship: education and nationalism in Europe, South Asia and China|author=V\u00e9ronique B\u00e9n\u00e9\u00ef|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36488-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XCUNB8koN-8C&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=Saffronization}}</ref> Saffron was chosen because in Hindu [[Sanatana Dharma]], the deep saffron colour is associated with sacrifice, religious abstinence, quest for light and salvation.

Before them, this colour was used by the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] group.\n* In Brazil, Turquoise is used as the main color of [[Rede Sustentabilidade|Sustaintability Network]], a progressive political party\n\n== White ==\n[[White]] is today mainly linked to [[pacifism]] (as in the [[White flag|surrender flag]])<ref name=\":0\" /> and in politics of the United Kingdom to independent politicians such as [[Martin Bell]].\n\n* Historically, it was associated with support for [[absolute monarchy]], starting with the supporters of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] of France because it was the dynasty's colour. Later it was used by the [[White movement|Whites]] who fought against the communist \"Reds\" in the [[Russian Civil War]], because some of the Russian \"Whites\" had similar goals to the French \"Whites\" of a century earlier (although, it is worth noting that the Whites included many different people with many ideologies, such as monarchists, liberals, and others).\n** Because of its use by anti-communist forces in Russia, the colour white came to be associated in the 20th century with many different [[anti-communist]] and counter-revolutionary groups, even those that did not support absolute monarchy (for example, the Finnish \"[[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]\" who fought against the socialist \"[[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]]\" in the civil war following the [[independence of Finland]]). In some revolutions, red is used to represent the revolutionaries and white is used to represent the supporters of the old order, regardless of the ideologies or goals of the two sides.\n* In Italy a red cross on a white shield (''scudo crociato'') is the emblem of Catholic parties from the historical [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party.\n* In [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] reversed the Islamist schema, using black shahada on a white background (symbol of purity).\n* In [[Singapore]], white is the colour associated with the [[People's Action Party]], the party that has been in power and dominating the Parliament since the country's independence.\n* In Uruguay, the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] is also known as \"White Party\", counterpart of the liberal \"[[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Red Party]]\" during the [[two-party system|two-party era]].\n* In [[Venezuela]], white has been the traditional colour of the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] party, one of the two parties that dominated the country's politics in the late 20th century (alongside [[Copei]]) and one of the parties currently in opposition to the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]].\n\n== Yellow ==\n[[Yellow]] used to be the colour most commonly associated with [[liberalism]] and [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Color Design Workbook: A Real World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design|last=Adams|first=Sean|last2=Morioka|first2=Noreen|last3=Stone|first3=Terry Lee|date=2006|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=159253192X|location=Gloucester, Mass.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86 86]|oclc=60393965|url=https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Rohit Vishal|last2=Joshi|first2=Radhika|date=October-December 2006|title=Colour, Colour Everywhere: In Marketing Too|journal=SCMS Journal of Indian Management|volume=3|issue=4|pages=40\u201346|issn=0973-3167|ssrn=969272}}</ref><ref>Cassel-Picot, Muriel \"The Liberal Democrats and the Green Cause: From Yellow to Green\" in Leydier, Gilles and Martin, Alexia (2013) ''Environmental Issues in Political Discourse in Britain and Ireland''.

For instance, in [[Thailand]] yellow represents [[Monarchy of Thailand|King]] [[Bhumibol]]. It was also the colour of the pro-monarchy [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system in the [[Kingdom of Nepal]].\n* It is also a common colour to represent [[Buddhism]], monks in [[Burma]] used it in the [[Saffron Revolution|anti-government protests]].\n* In Argentina, yellow is the colour for liberal right-wing party [[Republican Proposal]], led by [[Mauricio Macri]].\n* In [[Brazil]], yellow, combined with green, is associated with right-wing movements [[anti-corruption|against corruption]], anti-[[Workers Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]], supportive of [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and later, with support of [[Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign, 2018|Jair Bolsonaro]], like [[Partido Social Liberal|PSL]] and the [[Alliance for Brazil]]. The association came because many of the protesters against Dilma wears the jersey of [[Brazilian national football team]], which is yellow with the numbers and some details in green, and because the protesters chanted that [[brazilian flag]] \"will never be red\" and \"will be always green and yellow\". Red is the color of [[left-wing populist]] Workers' Party.\n* In Colombia, yellow is the colour of left-wing party [[Alternative Democratic Pole]].\n* In Costa Rica, yellow is the colour associated with the social democratic and progressive [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] (generally under a darker gold tone) and left-wing [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] (which uses a more lighter tone).

This was common in British politics up to the 1970s. The traditional colour of the [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]] Conservatives was yellow, rather than dark blue, even in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] Conservative candidates in Penrith and the neighbouring constituency of [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] wore blue and yellow rosettes.

Historically, the only common situation in which it has been necessary to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results. In such cases, there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours. However, in the weeks following the 2000 election there arose the terminology of [[red states and blue states]], in which the conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was associated with red and the liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with blue. Political observers latched on to this association, which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network. In 2004, the association was mostly kept. As of November 2012, maps for presidential elections produced by the U.S. government also use blue for Democrats and red for Republicans.<ref name=\"US-NARA-map\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/map/historic.html|title=Historic Election Results|publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref> In September 2010, the Democratic Party officially adopted an all-blue logo.<ref name=\"democrats.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/news/blog/575|title=Change That Matters|publisher=Democrats.org|date=14 September 2010|accessdate=17 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019042631/http://www.democrats.org/news/blog/575|archivedate=19 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Around the same time, the official Republican website began using a red logo.\n** This association has potential to confuse foreign observers in that, as described above, red is traditionally a left-wing colour, while blue is typically associated with right-wing politics. This is further complicated by the diversity of [[Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)|factions in the Democratic Party]] ranging from conservatives to right-libertarians to [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] alongside the dominant centrist and social liberal elements of the party that outside the United States often each use different political colors. \n**The conservative [[Blue Dog Coalition]] within the Democratic Party adopted the color blue at its founding before the 2000 election solidified the red-blue convention. \n** There is some historical use of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans: in the late 19th century and early 20th century, [[Texas]] county election boards used colour-coding to help Spanish speakers and illiterates identify the parties,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqrsu|title=Reds and Blues \u2013 The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Tshaonline.org|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> but this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not picked up on a national level. For instance in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] used maps that coded blue for the Republicans, the colour Harrison perceived to represent the Union and \"[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s Party\" and red for the Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tara A.

Politicians often attack deficit spending as \"being in the red.\"  For example, Republican presidential candidate [[Robert Dole]] in 1996 denounced one of President Bill Clinton's proposals because it would impose new costs on small business. Dole said: \"Now that the federal government is running in the red and state governments are faced with budget deficits that rise each year, the Democrats are looking for a new pocket to pick, and small business will fill that role.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Laham|title=A Lost Cause: Bill Clinton's Campaign for National Health Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lb2wMn4FRawC&pg=PA84|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=84|isbn=9780275956110}}</ref>\n** In [[Politics of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], the main conservative party, the [[New Progressive Party (Puerto Rico)|New Progressive Party]], uses blue, while the [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] uses red and the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] uses green.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Political uniform]]\n* [[List of political ideologies]]\n* [[List of political party symbols]]\n* [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#Affiliation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{color topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Political Colour}}\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n[[Category:Political symbols|Color]]\n[[Category:Color in culture]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo(s) fixed: However  \u2192 However, , hte \u2192 the", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_colour"}

She was removed from the care of her grandparents and moved in with her father's wealthier family in Worcester, Massachusetts. However, Bishop was unhappy there, and her separation from her maternal grandparents made her lonely. While she was living in Worcester, she developed chronic asthma, from which she suffered for the rest of her life.<ref Name=\"ParisR\"/> Her time in Worcester is briefly chronicled in her poem \"In The Waiting Room.\" In 1918, her grandparents, realizing that Bishop was unhappy living with them, sent her to live with her mother's oldest sister, Maude Bulmer Shepherdson, and her husband George. The Bishops paid Maude to house and educate their granddaughter. The Shepherdsons lived in a [[tenement]] in an impoverished [[Revere, Massachusetts]] neighborhood populated mostly by Irish and Italian immigrants. The family later moved to better circumstances in [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Cliftondale, Massachusetts]]. It was Bishop's aunt who introduced her to the works of Victorian poets, including [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Robert Browning]], and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].<ref name=Millier>{{cite book|last=Millier|first=Brett C.|title=Elizabeth Bishop: Life and the Memory of It|year=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn= 9780520203457 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWdngGZv3cYC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vassarion board, 1934.jpg|thumb|right|Bishop ''(bottom center)'' in 1934 with other members of Vassar's yearbook, the ''Vassarion'', of which she was editor-in-chief|alt=Four women stand behind three seated women, all facing the camera.]]\nBishop was very ill as a child and, as a result, received very little formal schooling until she attended [[Saugus High School (Massachusetts)|Saugus High School]] for her freshman year.

''Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell.'' University of Michigan Press (2001): 4. In an early letter to Moore, Bishop wrote: \"[W]hen I began to read your poetry at college I think it immediately opened up my eyes to the possibility of the subject-matter I could use and might never have thought of using if it hadn't been for you.\u2014(I might not have written any poems at all, I suppose.)

But they can't apparently.\"</ref> to whom she was introduced by a librarian at Vassar in 1934. Moore took a keen interest in Bishop's work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending [[Cornell Medical School]], where the poet had briefly enrolled herself after moving to [[New York City]] following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore's influence on Bishop's writing, Bishop's friend and Vassar peer, the writer [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] stated, \"Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [However,] I think there is something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there's nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\">Voices and Visions Series.

The friendship between the two women, memorialized by an extensive correspondence (see ''One Art''), endured until Moore's death in 1972. Bishop's \"At the Fishhouses\" (1955) contains allusions on several levels to Moore's 1924 poem \"A Grave.\"<ref>Stewart, Susan (2002) ''Poetry and the Fate of the Senses.''

After his death, she wrote, \"our friendship, [which was] often kept alive through years of separation only by letters, remained constant and affectionate, and I shall always be deeply grateful for it.\"<ref>Bishop, Elizabeth. ''Poems, Prose, and Letters''. New York: Library of America, 2008. 733.</ref> They also influenced each other's poetry.

This income allowed her to travel widely, though cheaply, without worrying about employment, and to live in many cities and countries which are described in her poems.<ref Name=\"ParisR\"/><ref>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/7 \"Elizabeth Bishop\"], ''poets.org'', Retrieved 2008-04-25</ref> She wrote frequently about her love of travel in poems like \"Questions of Travel\" and \"Over 2000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance.\" She lived in France for several years in the mid-1930s with a friend from Vassar, [[Louise Crane]], who was a paper-manufacturing heiress.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, FL.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, Florida]]\nIn 1938, the two of them purchased a house at 624 White Street in [[Key West, Florida]]. While living there Bishop made the acquaintance of [[Pauline Pfeiffer]] Hemingway, who had divorced [[Ernest Hemingway]] in 1940.\n\nShe later lived in an apartment at 611 Frances Street.\n\n[[File:Second Empire architecture in Georgetown.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1312 & 1314 30th Street NW, (built 1868)]]\nFrom 1949 to 1950, she was the Consultant in Poetry for the [[Library of Congress]], and lived at Bertha Looker's Boardinghouse, 1312 30th Street [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]], in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]].<ref>http://www.dcwriters.org/</ref>\n\nUpon receiving a substantial ($2,500) traveling fellowship from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1951, Bishop set off to circumnavigate South America by boat. Arriving in [[Santos (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Santos]], [[Brazil]] in November of that year, Bishop expected to stay two weeks but stayed 15 years. She lived in [[Petr\u00f3polis]] with architect [[Lota de Macedo Soares|Lota (Maria Carlota) de Macedo Soares]], who was descended from a prominent and notable political family.<ref name=\"rarecommon\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E1D81F3BF93AA35755C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all  \"The Love of Her Life,\"] June 2002 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of ''Rare and Commonplace Flowers: The Story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares'' Retrieved 2008-04-25</ref> Although Bishop was not forthcoming about details of her romance with Soares, much of their relationship was documented in Bishop's extensive correspondence with [[Samuel Ashley Brown]].

Her first book, ''North & South'', was first published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Prize for poetry. This book included important poems like \"The Man-Moth\" (which describes a dark and lonely fictional creature inspired by what Bishop noted was \"[a] newspaper misprint for 'mammoth'\") and \"The Fish\" (in which Bishop describes a caught fish in exacting detail). But she didn't publish a follow-up until nine years later. That volume, titled ''[[Poems: North & South\u2014A Cold Spring]]'', first published in 1955, included her first book, plus the 18 new poems that constituted the new \"Cold Spring\" section. Bishop won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]] for this book in 1956.\n\nThen there was another long wait before her next volume, ''Questions of Travel'', in 1965. This book showed the influence that living in Brazil had had on Bishop's writing. It included poems in the book's first section that were explicitly about life in Brazil including \"Arrival at Santos,\" \"Manuelzinho,\" and \"The Riverman.\" But in the second section of the volume Bishop also included pieces set in other locations like \"In the Village\" and \"First Death in Nova Scotia\", which take place in her native country. ''Questions of Travel'' was her first book to include one of her short stories (the aforementioned \"In the Village\").\n\nBishop's next major publication was ''The Complete Poems'' (1969), which included eight new poems and won a [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]]. The last new book of poems to appear in her lifetime, ''[[Geography III]]'' (1977), included frequently anthologized poems like \"In the Waiting Room\" and \"One Art.\" This book led to Bishop being the first American and the first Woman to be awarded the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]].<ref>[http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/1976-neustadt-laureate-elizabeth-bishop#.UbL_ResjE7A Neustadt International Prize for Literature listing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303215506/http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/1976-neustadt-laureate-elizabeth-bishop |date=March 3, 2014 }} Retrieved 2008-04-25</ref>\n\nBishop's ''The Complete Poems, 1927\u20131979'' was published posthumously in 1983. Other posthumous publications included ''The Collected Prose'' (1984; a compilation of her essays and short stories) and ''Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-box: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments'' (2006), whose publication aroused some controversy. [[Meghan O'Rourke]] notes in an article from ''Slate'' magazine, \"It's no wonder ... that the recent publication of Bishop's hitherto uncollected poems, drafts, and fragments ... encountered fierce resistance, and some debate about the value of making this work available to the public. In an outraged piece for ''The New Republic'', [[Helen Vendler]] labeled the drafts 'maimed and stunted' and rebuked Farrar, Straus and Giroux for choosing to publish the volume.\"<ref>O'Rourke, Meghan. \"[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_highbrow/2006/06/casual_perfection.single.html Casual Perfection: Why did the publication of Elizabeth Bishop's drafts cause an uproar?]\" ''Slate''. 13 June 2006.</ref>\n\n==Literary style and identity==\nWhere some of her notable contemporaries like [[Robert Lowell]] and [[John Berryman]] made the intimate details of their personal lives an important part of their poetry, Bishop avoided this practice altogether.<ref name=\"Vendler\">[http://media.nybooks.com/110308-vendler.mp3 Helen Vendler phone interview on Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop] audio podcast from ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Accessed 2010-09-11</ref> In contrast to this [[confessional poetry|confessional]] style involving large amounts of self-exposure, Bishop's style of writing, though it sometimes involved sparse details from her personal life, was known for its highly detailed, objective, and distant point of view and for its reticence on the kinds of personal subject matter that the work of her contemporaries involved. She used discretion when writing about details and people from her own life. \"In the Village\", a piece about her childhood and mentally unstable mother, is written as a third person narrative, and so the reader would only know of the story's autobiographical origins by knowing about Bishop's childhood.<ref>Bishop, Elizabeth. \"In the Village.\" ''Questions of Travel''.</ref>\n\nBishop did not see herself as a \"lesbian poet\" or as a \"female poet\". Because she refused to have her work published in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, [[Kathleen Spivack]], wrote in her memoir, \"I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet\u2014plus lesbian\u2014in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing to do with anything that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits.\"<ref>Spivack, Kathleen. ''Robert Lowell and His Circle: Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Stanley Kunitz, and Others.'' Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2012.</ref> However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be \"a strong feminist\" but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.<ref Name=\"ParisR\"/><ref>Kalstone, David and Hemenway, Robert (2003) ''Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press</ref>\n\nAlthough generally supportive of the \"[[confessional poetry|confessional]]\" style of her friend, Robert Lowell, she drew the line at his highly controversial book ''The Dolphin'' (1973), in which he used and altered private letters from his ex-wife, [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]] (whom he divorced after 23 years of marriage), as material for his poems. In a letter to Lowell, dated March 21, 1972, Bishop strongly urged him against publishing the book: \"One can use one's life as material [for poems]\u2014one does anyway\u2014but these letters\u2014aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission\u2014IF you hadn't changed them... etc. But ''art just isn't worth that much''.\"<ref>''Words in Air: the Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell''.

In this poem, her experience of that event is through a child's point of view.  The poem highlights that although young and naive the child has some instinctive awareness of the severe impact of death. She combines reality and imagination, a technique also used in her poem \"Sestina\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rmcnamar/383/bishop.html|title=Elizabeth Bishop: Sestina|last=Ruby|first=|date=2012-01-24|website=Elizabeth Bishop|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Sestina\" ===\nBishop's poem \"Sestina\", published in 1965, depicts a real-life experience. After her father's death when she was a baby and following her mother's nervous breakdown when she was 5, Bishop's poem notes her experience is after she has gone to live with relatives. The poem is about her living with the knowledge that she would not get to see her mother again. Bishop writes, \"Time to plant tears, says the almanac. / The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove / and the child draws another inscrutable house.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rmcnamar/383/bishop.html|title=Sestina|last=McNamarra|first=Robert|website=staff.washington.edu|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref> The style of her poem, the [[Sestina]], is a poetry style created by [[Arnaut Daniel]] in the 12th century, focused on the emphases of ending words in each line, giving the poem a sense of form and pattern.

She was removed from the care of her grandparents and moved in with her father's wealthier family in Worcester, Massachusetts.

While she was living in Worcester, she developed chronic asthma, from which she suffered for the rest of her life.<ref Name=\"ParisR\"/> Her time in Worcester is briefly chronicled in her poem \"In The Waiting Room.\" In 1918, her grandparents, realizing that Bishop was unhappy living with them, sent her to live with her mother's oldest sister, Maude Bulmer Shepherdson, and her husband George. The Bishops paid Maud to house and educate their granddaughter. The Shepherdsons lived in a [[tenement]] in an impoverished [[Revere, Massachusetts]] neighborhood populated mostly by Irish and Italian immigrants.

Moore took a keen interest in Bishop's work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending [[Cornell Medical School]], where the poet had briefly enrolled herself after moving to [[New York City]] following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore's influence on Bishop's writing, Bishop's friend and Vassar peer, the writer [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] stated, \"Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [However,] I think there is something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there's nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\">Voices and Visions Series.

The friendship between the two women, memorialized by an extensive correspondence (see ''One Art''), endured until Moore's death in 1972. Bishop's \"At the Fishhouses\" (1955) contains allusions on several levels to Moore's 1924 poem \"A Grave.\"<ref>Stewart, Susan (2002) ''Poetry and the Fate of the Senses.''

This income allowed her to travel widely, though cheaply, without worrying about employment, and to live in many cities and countries which are described in her poems.<ref Name=\"ParisR\"/><ref>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/7 \"Elizabeth Bishop\"], ''poets.org'', Retrieved 2008-04-25</ref> She wrote frequently about her love of travel in poems like \"Questions of Travel\" and \"Over 2000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance.\" She lived in France for several years in the mid-1930s with a friend from Vassar, [[Louise Crane]], who was a paper-manufacturing heiress.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, FL.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, Florida]]\nIn 1938, the two of them purchased a house at 624 White Street in [[Key West, Florida]]. While living there Bishop made the acquaintance of [[Pauline Pfeiffer]] Hemingway, who had divorced [[Ernest Hemingway]] in 1940.\n\nShe later lived in an apartment at 611 Frances Street.\n\n[[File:Second Empire architecture in Georgetown.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1312 & 1314 30th Street NW, (built 1868)]]\nFrom 1949 to 1950, she was the Consultant in Poetry for the [[Library of Congress]], and lived at Bertha Looker's Boardinghouse, 1312 30th Street [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]], in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]].<ref>http://www.dcwriters.org/</ref>\n\nUpon receiving a substantial ($2,500) traveling fellowship from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1951, Bishop set off to circumnavigate South America by boat. Arriving in [[Santos (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Santos]], [[Brazil]] in November of that year, Bishop expected to stay two weeks but stayed 15 years. She lived in [[Petr\u00f3polis]] with architect [[Lota de Macedo Soares|Lota (Maria Carlota) de Macedo Soares]], who was descended from a prominent and notable political family.<ref name=\"rarecommon\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E1D81F3BF93AA35755C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all  \"The Love of Her Life,\"] June 2002 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of ''Rare and Commonplace Flowers: The Story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares'' Retrieved 2008-04-25</ref> Although Bishop was not forthcoming about details of her romance with Soares, much of their relationship was documented in Bishop's extensive correspondence with [[Samuel Ashley Brown]].

Her first book, ''North & South'', was first published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Prize for poetry. This book included important poems like \"The Man-Moth\" (which describes a dark and lonely fictional creature inspired by what Bishop noted was \"[a] newspaper misprint for 'mammoth'\") and \"The Fish\" (in which Bishop describes a caught fish in exacting detail). But she didn't publish a follow-up until nine years later. That volume, titled ''[[Poems: North & South\u2014A Cold Spring]]'', first published in 1955, included her first book, plus the 18 new poems that constituted the new \"Cold Spring\" section. Bishop won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]] for this book in 1956.\n\nThen there was another long wait before her next volume, ''Questions of Travel'', in 1965. This book showed the influence that living in Brazil had had on Bishop's writing. It included poems in the book's first section that were explicitly about life in Brazil including \"Arrival at Santos,\" \"Manuelzinho,\" and \"The Riverman.\" But in the second section of the volume Bishop also included pieces set in other locations like \"In the Village\" and \"First Death in Nova Scotia\", which take place in her native country. ''Questions of Travel'' was her first book to include one of her short stories (the aforementioned \"In the Village\").\n\nBishop's next major publication was ''The Complete Poems'' (1969), which included eight new poems and won a [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]]. The last new book of poems to appear in her lifetime, ''[[Geography III]]'' (1977), included frequently anthologized poems like \"In the Waiting Room\" and \"One Art.\" This book led to Bishop being the first American and the first Woman to be awarded the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]].<ref>[http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/1976-neustadt-laureate-elizabeth-bishop#.UbL_ResjE7A Neustadt International Prize for Literature listing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303215506/http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/1976-neustadt-laureate-elizabeth-bishop |date=March 3, 2014 }} Retrieved 2008-04-25</ref>\n\nBishop's ''The Complete Poems, 1927\u20131979'' was published posthumously in 1983. Other posthumous publications included ''The Collected Prose'' (1984; a compilation of her essays and short stories) and ''Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-box: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments'' (2006), whose publication aroused some controversy. [[Meghan O'Rourke]] notes in an article from ''Slate'' magazine, \"It's no wonder ... that the recent publication of Bishop's hitherto uncollected poems, drafts, and fragments ... encountered fierce resistance, and some debate about the value of making this work available to the public. In an outraged piece for ''The New Republic'', [[Helen Vendler]] labeled the drafts 'maimed and stunted' and rebuked Farrar, Straus and Giroux for choosing to publish the volume.\"<ref>O'Rourke, Meghan. \"[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_highbrow/2006/06/casual_perfection.single.html Casual Perfection: Why did the publication of Elizabeth Bishop's drafts cause an uproar?]\" ''Slate''. 13 June 2006.</ref>\n\n==Literary style and identity==\nWhere some of her notable contemporaries like [[Robert Lowell]] and [[John Berryman]] made the intimate details of their personal lives an important part of their poetry, Bishop avoided this practice altogether.<ref name=\"Vendler\">[http://media.nybooks.com/110308-vendler.mp3 Helen Vendler phone interview on Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop] audio podcast from ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Accessed 2010-09-11</ref> In contrast to this [[confessional poetry|confessional]] style involving large amounts of self-exposure, Bishop's style of writing, though it sometimes involved sparse details from her personal life, was known for its highly detailed, objective, and distant point of view and for its reticence on the kinds of personal subject matter that the work of her contemporaries involved. She used discretion when writing about details and people from her own life. \"In the Village\", a piece about her childhood and mentally unstable mother, is written as a third person narrative, and so the reader would only know of the story's autobiographical origins by knowing about Bishop's childhood.<ref>Bishop, Elizabeth. \"In the Village.\" ''Questions of Travel''.</ref>\n\nBishop did not see herself as a \"lesbian poet\" or as a \"female poet\". Because she refused to have her work published in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, [[Kathleen Spivack]], wrote in her memoir, \"I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet\u2014plus lesbian\u2014in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing to do with anything that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits.\"<ref>Spivack, Kathleen. ''Robert Lowell and His Circle: Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Stanley Kunitz, and Others.'' Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2012.</ref> However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be \"a strong feminist\" but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.<ref Name=\"ParisR\"/><ref>Kalstone, David and Hemenway, Robert (2003) ''Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press</ref>\n\nAlthough generally supportive of the \"[[confessional poetry|confessional]]\" style of her friend, Robert Lowell, she drew the line at his highly controversial book ''The Dolphin'' (1973), in which he used and altered private letters from his ex-wife, [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]] (whom he divorced after 23 years of marriage), as material for his poems. In a letter to Lowell, dated March 21, 1972, Bishop strongly urged him against publishing the book: \"One can use one's life as material [for poems]\u2014one does anyway\u2014but these letters\u2014aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission\u2014IF you hadn't changed them... etc. But ''art just isn't worth that much''.\"<ref>''Words in Air: the Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell''.

In this poem, her experience of that event is through a child's point of view.  The poem highlights that although young and naive the child has some instinctive awareness of the severe impact of death. She combines reality and imagination, a technique also used in her poem \"Sestina\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rmcnamar/383/bishop.html|title=Elizabeth Bishop: Sestina|last=Ruby|first=|date=2012-01-24|website=Elizabeth Bishop|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Sestina\" ===\nBishop's poem \"Sestina\", published in 1965, depicts a real-life experience. After her father's death when she was a baby and following her mother's nervous breakdown when she was 5, Bishop's poem notes her experience is after she has gone to live with relatives. The poem is about her living with the knowledge that she would not get to see her mother again. Bishop writes, \"Time to plant tears, says the almanac. / The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove / and the child draws another inscrutable house.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rmcnamar/383/bishop.html|title=Sestina|last=McNamarra|first=Robert|website=staff.washington.edu|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref> The style of her poem, the [[Sestina]], is a poetry style created by [[Arnaut Daniel]] in the 12th century, focused on the emphases of ending words in each line, giving the poem a sense of form and pattern.

While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek.

They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end.

Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates of the number of people who died at the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek.

They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end.

Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

{"title_page": "Conditional (computer programming)", "text_new": "[[File:If-Then-Else-diagram.svg|thumb|If-Then-Else flow diagram]]\n[[File:IF-THEN-ELSE-END flowchart.svg|thumb|right|A nested \"If\u2013Then\u2013Else\" flow diagram]]\nIn [[computer science]], '''conditional statements''', '''conditional expressions''' and '''conditional constructs''' are features of a [[programming language]], which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified [[boolean datatype|boolean]] ''condition'' evaluates to true or false. Apart from the case of [[branch predication]], this is always achieved by selectively altering the [[control flow]] based on some condition.\n\nIn [[imperative programming]] languages, the term \"conditional [[statement (programming)|statement]]\" is usually used, whereas in [[functional programming]], the terms \"conditional [[expression (programming)|expression]]\" or \"conditional construct\" are preferred, because these terms all have distinct meanings.\n\nAlthough [[dynamic dispatch]] is not usually classified as a conditional construct, it is another way to select between alternatives at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]].\n\n== If\u2013then(\u2013else) ==\n{{Redirect|if-then-else|the album|If Then Else}}\nThe <code>if\u2013then</code> construct (sometimes called <code>if\u2013then\u2013else</code>) is common across many programming languages. Although the syntax varies from language to language, the basic structure (in [[pseudocode]] form) looks like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"qbasic\">\nIf (boolean condition) Then\n    (consequent)\nElse\n    (alternative)\nEnd If \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example code above, the part represented by ''(boolean condition)'' constitutes a conditional ''expression'', having intrinsic value (e.g., it may be substituted by either of the values <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>) but having no intrinsic meaning. In contrast, the combination of this expression, the <code>If</code> and <code>Then</code> surrounding it, and the consequent that follows afterward constitute a conditional ''statement'', having intrinsic meaning (e.g., expressing a coherent logical rule) but no intrinsic value.\n\nWhen an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] finds an <code>If</code>, it expects a [[boolean datatype|boolean]] condition \u2013 for example, <code>x > 0</code>, which means \"the variable x contains a number that is greater than zero\" \u2013 and evaluates that condition. If the condition is <code>true</code>, the statements following the <code>then</code> are executed. Otherwise, the execution continues in the following branch \u2013 either in the <code>else</code> [[Block (programming)|block]] (which is usually optional), or if there is no <code>else</code> branch, then after the <code>end If</code>.\n\nAfter either branch has been executed, [[control flow|control]] returns to the point after the <code>end If</code>.\n\nIn early programming languages, especially some dialects of [[BASIC]] in the 1980s [[home computer]]s, an <code>if\u2013then</code> statement could only contain <code>[[GOTO]]</code> statements (equivalent to a [[Branch (computer science)|branch]] instruction). This led to a hard-to-read style of programming known as [[spaghetti programming]], with programs in this style called ''spaghetti code''.  As a result, [[structured programming]], which allows (virtually) arbitrary statements to be put in statement blocks inside an <code>if</code> statement, gained in popularity, until it became the norm even in most BASIC programming circles. Such mechanisms and principles were based on the older but more advanced [[ALGOL]] family of languages, and ALGOL-like languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[Modula-2]] influenced modern BASIC variants for many years. While it is possible while using only <code>GOTO</code> statements in <code>if\u2013then</code> statements to write programs that are not spaghetti code and are just as well structured and readable as programs written in a structured programming language, structured programming makes this easier and enforces it.  Structured <code>if\u2013then\u2013else</code> statements like the example above are one of the key elements of structured programming, and they are present in most popular high-level programming languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] and [[Visual Basic]] .\n\nA subtlety is that the optional else clause found in many languages means that the [[context-free grammar]] is [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]], since [[Nesting (computing)|nested]] conditionals can be parsed in multiple ways. Specifically, \n '''if''' a '''then''' '''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2\ncan be parsed as\n '''if''' a '''then''' ('''if''' b '''then''' s) '''else''' s2\nor\n '''if''' a '''then''' ('''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2)\ndepending on whether the <code>else</code> is associated with the first <code>if</code> or second <code>if</code>. This is known as the [[dangling else]] problem, and is resolved in various ways, depending on the language.\n\n=== Else if===\n\nBy using <code>else if</code>, it is possible to combine several conditions. Only the statements following the first condition that is found to be true will be executed. All other statements will be skipped.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nif condition then\n   --statements\nelseif condition then\n    -- more statements\nelseif condition then\n    -- more statements;\n...\nelse\n    -- other statements;\nend if;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe statements of <code>elseif</code>, in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], is simply [[syntactic sugar]] for <code>else</code> followed by <code>if</code>. In Ada, the difference is that only one <code>end if</code> is needed, if one uses <code>elseif</code> instead of <code>else</code> followed by <code>if</code>. [[PHP]] uses the <code>elseif</code> keyword<ref name=\"php_elseif\">''[http://php.net/manual/control-structures.elseif.php PHP elseif syntax]''</ref> both for its curly brackets or colon syntaxes. [[Perl]] provides the keyword <code>elsif</code> to avoid the large number of braces that would be required by multiple <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] uses the special keyword <code>elif</code> because structure is denoted by indentation rather than braces, so a repeated use of <code>else</code> and <code>if</code> would require increased indentation after every condition. Some implementations of [[BASIC]], such as [[Visual Basic]]<ref name=\"vb_elseif\">''[https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement Visual Basic ElseIf syntax]''</ref>, use <code>ElseIf</code> too. Similarly, the earlier UNIX shells (later gathered up to the POSIX shell syntax<ref name=\"posixshell\">''[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html POSIX standard shell syntax]''</ref>) use elif too, but giving the choice of delimiting with spaces, line breaks, or both.\n\nHowever, in many languages more directly descended from Algol, such as [[Algol68]], [[Simula (programming language)|Simula]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[BCPL (programming language)|BCPL]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], this special syntax for the <code>else if</code> construct is not present, nor is it present in the many syntactical derivatives of C, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ECMAScript]], and so on. This works because in these languages, any ''single'' statement (in this case <code>if ''cond''</code>...) can follow a conditional without being enclosed in a block.\n\nThis design choice has a slight \"cost\" in that code <code>else if</code> branch is, effectively, adding an extra nesting level, complicating the job for some compilers (or its implementers), which has to analyse and implement arbitrarily long <code>else if</code> chains recursively.\n\nIf all terms in the sequence of conditionals are testing the value of a single expression (e.g., <code>if x=0</code> ... <code>else if x=1</code> ... <code>else if x=2</code>...), then an alternative is the [[switch statement]], also called case-statement or select-statement. Conversely, in languages that do not have a switch statement, these can be produced by a sequence of <code>else if</code> statements.\n\n===If\u2013then\u2013else expressions===\nMany languages support ''if expressions'', which are similar to if statements, but return a value as a result. Thus, they are true expressions (which evaluate to a value), not statements (which may not be permitted in the context of a value).\n\n====Algol family====\n[[ALGOL 60]] and some other members of the [[ALGOL]] family allow <code>if\u2013then\u2013else</code> as an expression:\n<pre>\n  myvariable := if x > 20 then 1 else 2\n</pre> <!-- Don't place a semicolon at the end of the above ALGOL statement. It is NOT C. -->\n\n====Lisp dialects====\nIn dialects of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]{{nbsp}}\u2013 [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Common Lisp]]{{nbsp}}\u2013 the first of which was inspired to a great extent by ALGOL:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"scheme\">\n;; Scheme\n(define myvariable (if (> x 12) 1 2))   ; Assigns 'myvariable' to 1 or 2, depending on the value of 'x'\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lisp\">\n;; Common Lisp\n(let ((x 10))\n  (setq myvariable (if (> x 12) 2 4)))  ; Assigns 'myvariable' to 2\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Haskell====\nIn [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] 98, there is only an ''if expression'', no ''if statement'', and the <code>else</code> part is compulsory, as every expression must have some value.<ref name=\"haskell98report\">''[http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/ Haskell 98 Language and Libraries: The Revised Report]''</ref> Logic that would be expressed with conditionals in other languages is usually expressed with [[pattern matching]] in recursive functions.\n\nBecause Haskell is [[lazy evaluation|lazy]], it is possible to write control structures, such as ''if'', as ordinary expressions; the lazy evaluation means that an ''if function'' can evaluate only the condition and proper branch (where a strict language would evaluate all three). It can be written like this:<ref name=\"haskell-ifthenelse-proposal\">\"[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/If-then-else If-then-else Proposal on HaskellWiki]\"</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nif' :: Bool -> a -> a -> a\nif' True x _ = x\nif' False _ y = y\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====C-like languages====\n[[C (programming language)|C]] and C-like languages have a special [[ternary operator]] ([[?:]]) for conditional expressions with a function that may be described by a template like this:\n <code>condition ? evaluated-when-true : evaluated-when-false</code>\nThis means that it can be inlined into expressions, unlike if-statements, in C-like languages:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nmy_variable = x > 10 ? \"foo\" : \"bar\";  // In C-like languages\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwhich can be compared to the Algol-family if\u2013then\u2013else ''expressions'' (in contrast to a ''statement'') (and similar in Ruby and Scala, among others).\n\nTo accomplish the same using an if-statement, this would take more than one line of code (under typical layout conventions), and require mentioning \"my_variable\" twice:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nif (x > 10)\n    my_variable = \"foo\";\nelse\n    my_variable = \"bar\";\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSome argue that the explicit if/then statement is easier to read and that it may compile to more efficient code than the ternary operator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2009/02/efficient-c-tips-6-dont-use-the-ternary-operator/ |title=Efficient C Tips #6 \u2013 Don\u2019t use the ternary operator \u00ab Stack Overflow |publisher=Embeddedgurus.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref> while others argue that concise expression are easier to read than statements spread over several lines containing repetition.\n\n====In [[Small Basic]]====\n<source lang=vbnet>\nx = TextWindow.ReadNumber()\nIf (x > 10) Then\n    TextWindow.WriteLine(\"My variable is named 'foo'.\")\nElse\n    TextWindow.WriteLine(\"My variable is named 'bar'.\")\nEndIf\n</source>\n\nFirst, when the user runs the program, a cursor appears waiting for the reader to type a number. If that number is greater than 10, the text \"My variable is named 'foo'.\" is displayed on the screen. If the number is smaller than 10, then the message \"My variable is named 'bar'.\" is printed on the screen.\n\n====In Visual Basic====\nIn [[Visual Basic]] and some other languages, a function called <code>[[IIf]]</code> is provided, which can be used as a conditional expression. However, it does not behave like a true conditional expression, because both the true and false branches are always evaluated; it is just that the result of one of them is thrown away, while the result of the other is returned by the IIf function.\n\n=== Arithmetic if ===\nUp to [[Fortran 77]], the language Fortran has an \"arithmetic if\" statement which is halfway between a computed IF and a case statement, based on the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]] {{nowrap|''x'' < 0,}} {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0,}} {{nowrap|''x'' > 0.}} This was the earliest conditional statement in Fortran:<ref name=\"fortran77\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/rjcnf0001-sh-11.html#sh-11.4 |title = American National Standard Programming Language FORTRAN |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |date = 1978-04-03 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011055359/http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/rjcnf0001-sh-11.html#sh-11.4 |archive-date = 2007-10-11 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nIF (e) label1, label2, label3\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhere e is any numeric expression (not necessarily an integer); this is equivalent to\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nIF (e .LT. 0) GOTO label1\nIF (e .EQ. 0) GOTO label2\nGOTO label3\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBecause this [[arithmetic IF]] is equivalent to multiple <code>GOTO</code> statements that could jump to anywhere, it is considered to be an unstructured control statement, and should not be used if more structured statements can be used. In practice it has been observed that most arithmetic <code>IF</code> statements referenced the following statement with one or two of the labels.\n\nThis was the only conditional control statement in the original implementation of Fortran on the [[IBM 704]] computer. On that computer the test-and-branch op-code had three addresses for those three states. Other computers would have \"flag\" registers such as positive, zero, negative, even, overflow, carry, associated with the last arithmetic operations and would use instructions such as 'Branch if accumulator negative' then 'Branch if accumulator zero' or similar. Note that the expression is evaluated ''once only'', and in cases such as integer arithmetic where overflow may occur, the overflow or carry flags would be considered also.\n\n=== Object-oriented implementation in Smalltalk ===\n\nIn contrast to other languages, in [[Smalltalk]] the conditional statement is not a [[language construct]] but defined in the class <code>Boolean</code> as an abstract method that takes two parameters, both [[Closure (computer science)|closure]]s. <code>Boolean</code> has two subclasses, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, which both define the method, <code>True</code> executing the first closure only, <code>False</code> executing the second closure only.<ref name=\"Smalltalk conditionals\">{{cite web |url = http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/VisualWorks/Conditional+Processing |title = VisualWorks: Conditional Processing |date = 2006-12-16 |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022201949/http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/VisualWorks/Conditional+Processing |archive-date = 2007-10-22 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"smalltalk\">\nvar = condition \n    ifTrue: [ 'foo' ]\n    ifFalse: [ 'bar' ]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n=== JavaScript ===\nTwo examples in [[JavaScript]]:\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nif (Math.random() < 0.5) {\n  console.log(\"You got Heads!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"You got Tails!\");\n}\n</source>\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nvar x = Math.random();\nif (x < 1/3) {\n  console.log(\"One person won!\");\n} else if (x < 2/3) {\n  console.log(\"Two people won!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"It's a three-way tie!\");\n}\n</source>\n\n== Lambda Calculus ==\nIn [[Lambda calculus|Lambda Calculus]], the concept of an if-then-else conditional can be expressed using the expressions:\n true = \u03bbx. \u03bby. x\n false = \u03bbx. \u03bby. y\n ifThenElse = (\u03bbc. \u03bbx. \u03bby. (c x y))\n# true takes up to two arguments and once both are provided (see [[currying]]), it returns the first argument given. \n# false takes up to two arguments and once both are provided(see [[currying]]), it returns the second argument given.\n# ifThenElse takes up to three arguments and once all are provided, it passes both second and third argument to the first argument(which is a function that given two arguments, and produces a result). We expect ifThenElse to only take true or false as an argument, both of which project the given two arguments to their preferred single argument, which is then returned. \n'''note''': if ifThenElse is passed two functions as the left and right conditionals; it is '''necessary''' to also pass an empty tuple () to the result of ifThenElse in order to actually call the chosen function, otherwise ifThenElse will just return the function object without getting called.\n\nIn a system where numbers can be used without definition (like Lisp, Traditional paper math, so on), the above can be expressed as a single closure below:\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ((\u03bbtrue. \u03bbfalse. \u03bbifThenElse.\n     (ifThenElse true 2 3)\n )(\u03bbx. \u03bby. x)(\u03bbx. \u03bby. y)(\u03bbc. \u03bbl. \u03bbr. c l r))\n</source>\nHere, true, false, and ifThenElse are bound to their respective definitions which are passed to their scope at the end of their block.\n\nA working JavaScript analogy(using only functions of single variable for rigor) to this is:\n<source lang=\"JavaScript\">\n var computationResult = ((_true => _false => _ifThenElse => \n     _ifThenElse(_true)(2)(3) \n )(x => y => x)(x => y => y)(c => x => y => c(x)(y)));\n</source>\nThe code above with multivariable functions looks like this:\n<source lang=\"JavaScript\">\n var computationResult = ((_true, _false, _ifThenElse) =>\n     _ifThenElse(_true, 2, 3)\n )((x, y) => x, (x, y) => y, (c, x, y) => c(x, y));\n</source>\nanother version of the earlier example without a system where numbers are assumed is below.\n\nFirst example shows the  first branch being taken, while second example shows the second branch being taken.\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ((\u03bbtrue. \u03bbfalse. \u03bbifThenElse.\n     (ifThenElse true (\u03bbFirstBranch.

There is usually a provision for a default action ('else','otherwise') to be taken if no match succeeds. Switch statements can allow [[Optimizing compiler|compiler optimizations]], such as [[lookup table]]s. In dynamic languages, the cases may not be limited to constant expressions, and might extend to [[pattern matching]], as in the [[shell script]] example on the right, where the '*)' implements the default case as a [[regular expression]] matching any string.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is available in many programming languages with functional programming features, such as [[Wolfram Language]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and many others. Here is a simple example written in the [[OCaml]] language:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ocaml\">\nmatch fruit with\n| \"apple\" -> cook pie\n| \"coconut\" -> cook dango_mochi\n| \"banana\" -> mix;;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe power of pattern matching is the ability to ''concisely'' match not only actions but also ''values'' to patterns of data. Here is an example written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] which illustrates both of these features:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nmap _ []      = []\nmap f (h : t) = f h : map f t\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis code defines a function ''map'', which applies the first argument (a function) to each of the elements of the second argument (a list), and returns the resulting list. The two lines are the two definitions of the function for the two kinds of arguments possible in this case \u2013 one where the list is empty (just return an empty list) and the other case where the list is not empty.\n\nPattern matching is not strictly speaking ''always'' a choice construct, because it is possible in Haskell to write only one alternative, which is guaranteed to always be matched \u2013 in this situation, it is not being used as a choice construct, but simply as a way to bind names to values. However, it is frequently used as a choice construct in the languages in which it is available.\n\n== Hash-based conditionals ==\nIn programming languages that have [[associative array]]s or comparable data structures, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Objective-C]], it is idiomatic to use them to implement conditional assignment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codingstyleguide.com/style/180/python-pythonic-way-to-implement-switchcase-statements|title=Pythonic way to implement switch/case statements|access-date=2015-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120120833/http://codingstyleguide.com/style/180/python-pythonic-way-to-implement-switchcase-statements|archive-date=2015-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\npet = raw_input(\"Enter the type of pet you want to name: \")\nknown_pets = {\n    \"Dog\": \"Fido\",\n    \"Cat\": \"Meowsles\",\n    \"Bird\": \"Tweety\",\n}\nmy_name = known_pets[pet]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn languages that have [[anonymous function]]s or that allow a programmer to assign a named function to a variable reference, conditional flow can be implemented by using a hash as a [[dispatch table]].\n\n==Predication==\n{{Main|Branch predication}}\nAn alternative to conditional branch instructions is [[branch predication|predication]].

Apart from the case of [[branch predication]], this is always achieved by selectively altering the [[control flow]] based on some condition.\n\nIn [[imperative programming]] languages, the term \"conditional [[statement (programming)|statement]]\" is usually used, whereas in [[functional programming]], the terms \"conditional [[expression (programming)|expression]]\" or \"conditional construct\" are preferred, because these terms all have distinct meanings.\n\nAlthough [[dynamic dispatch]] is not usually classified as a conditional construct, it is another way to select between alternatives at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]].\n\n== If\u2013then(\u2013else) ==\n{{Redirect|if-then-else|the album|If Then Else}}\nThe <code>if\u2013then</code> construct (sometimes called <code>if\u2013then\u2013else</code>) is common across many programming languages. Although the syntax varies from language to language, the basic structure (in [[pseudocode]] form) looks like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"qbasic\">\nIf (boolean condition) Then\n    (consequent)\nElse\n    (alternative)\nEnd If \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example code above, the part represented by ''(boolean condition)'' constitutes a conditional ''expression'', having intrinsic value (e.g., it may be substituted by either of the values <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>) but having no intrinsic meaning. In contrast, the combination of this expression, the <code>If</code> and <code>Then</code> surrounding it, and the consequent that follows afterward constitute a conditional ''statement'', having intrinsic meaning (e.g., expressing a coherent logical rule) but no intrinsic value.\n\nWhen an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] finds an <code>If</code>, it expects a [[boolean datatype|boolean]] condition \u2013 for example, <code>x > 0</code>, which means \"the variable x contains a number that is greater than zero\" \u2013 and evaluates that condition. If the condition is <code>true</code>, the statements following the <code>then</code> are executed. Otherwise, the execution continues in the following branch \u2013 either in the <code>else</code> [[Block (programming)|block]] (which is usually optional), or if there is no <code>else</code> branch, then after the <code>end If</code>.\n\nAfter either branch has been executed, [[control flow|control]] returns to the point after the <code>end If</code>.\n\nIn early programming languages, especially some dialects of [[BASIC]] in the 1980s [[home computer]]s, an <code>if\u2013then</code> statement could only contain <code>[[GOTO]]</code> statements (equivalent to a [[branch|Branch_(computer_science)]] instruction). This led to a hard-to-read style of programming known as [[spaghetti programming]], with programs in this style called ''spaghetti code''.  As a result, [[structured programming]], which allows (virtually) arbitrary statements to be put in statement blocks inside an <code>if</code> statement, gained in popularity, until it became the norm even in most BASIC programming circles. Such mechanisms and principles were based on the older but more advanced [[ALGOL]] family of languages, and ALGOL-like languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[Modula-2]] influenced modern BASIC variants for many years. While it is possible while using only <code>GOTO</code> statements in <code>if\u2013then</code> statements to write programs that are not spaghetti code and are just as well structured and readable as programs written in a structured programming language, structured programming makes this easier and enforces it.  Structured <code>if\u2013then\u2013else</code> statements like the example above are one of the key elements of structured programming, and they are present in most popular high-level programming languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] and [[Visual Basic]] .\n\nA subtlety is that the optional else clause found in many languages means that the [[context-free grammar]] is [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]], since [[Nesting (computing)|nested]] conditionals can be parsed in multiple ways. Specifically, \n '''if''' a '''then''' '''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2\ncan be parsed as\n '''if''' a '''then''' ('''if''' b '''then''' s) '''else''' s2\nor\n '''if''' a '''then''' ('''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2)\ndepending on whether the <code>else</code> is associated with the first <code>if</code> or second <code>if</code>. This is known as the [[dangling else]] problem, and is resolved in various ways, depending on the language.\n\n=== Else if===\n\nBy using <code>else if</code>, it is possible to combine several conditions. Only the statements following the first condition that is found to be true will be executed. All other statements will be skipped.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nif condition then\n   --statements\nelseif condition then\n    -- more statements\nelseif condition then\n    -- more statements;\n...\nelse\n    -- other statements;\nend if;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe statements of <code>elseif</code>, in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], is simply [[syntactic sugar]] for <code>else</code> followed by <code>if</code>. In Ada, the difference is that only one <code>end if</code> is needed, if one uses <code>elseif</code> instead of <code>else</code> followed by <code>if</code>. [[PHP]] uses the <code>elseif</code> keyword<ref name=\"php_elseif\">''[http://php.net/manual/control-structures.elseif.php PHP elseif syntax]''</ref> both for its curly brackets or colon syntaxes. [[Perl]] provides the keyword <code>elsif</code> to avoid the large number of braces that would be required by multiple <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] uses the special keyword <code>elif</code> because structure is denoted by indentation rather than braces, so a repeated use of <code>else</code> and <code>if</code> would require increased indentation after every condition. Some implementations of [[BASIC]], such as [[Visual Basic]]<ref name=\"vb_elseif\">''[https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement Visual Basic ElseIf syntax]''</ref>, use <code>ElseIf</code> too. Similarly, the earlier UNIX shells (later gathered up to the POSIX shell syntax<ref name=\"posixshell\">''[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html POSIX standard shell syntax]''</ref>) use elif too, but giving the choice of delimiting with spaces, line breaks, or both.\n\nHowever, in many languages more directly descended from Algol, such as [[Algol68]], [[Simula (programming language)|Simula]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[BCPL (programming language)|BCPL]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], this special syntax for the <code>else if</code> construct is not present, nor is it present in the many syntactical derivatives of C, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ECMAScript]], and so on. This works because in these languages, any ''single'' statement (in this case <code>if ''cond''</code>...) can follow a conditional without being enclosed in a block.\n\nThis design choice has a slight \"cost\" in that code <code>else if</code> branch is, effectively, adding an extra nesting level, complicating the job for some compilers (or its implementers), which has to analyse and implement arbitrarily long <code>else if</code> chains recursively.\n\nIf all terms in the sequence of conditionals are testing the value of a single expression (e.g., <code>if x=0</code> ... <code>else if x=1</code> ... <code>else if x=2</code>...), then an alternative is the [[switch statement]], also called case-statement or select-statement. Conversely, in languages that do not have a switch statement, these can be produced by a sequence of <code>else if</code> statements.\n\n===If\u2013then\u2013else expressions===\nMany languages support ''if expressions'', which are similar to if statements, but return a value as a result. Thus, they are true expressions (which evaluate to a value), not statements (which may not be permitted in the context of a value).\n\n====Algol family====\n[[ALGOL 60]] and some other members of the [[ALGOL]] family allow <code>if\u2013then\u2013else</code> as an expression:\n<pre>\n  myvariable := if x > 20 then 1 else 2\n</pre> <!-- Don't place a semicolon at the end of the above ALGOL statement. It is NOT C. -->\n\n====Lisp dialects====\nIn dialects of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]{{nbsp}}\u2013 [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Common Lisp]]{{nbsp}}\u2013 the first of which was inspired to a great extent by ALGOL:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"scheme\">\n;; Scheme\n(define myvariable (if (> x 12) 1 2))   ; Assigns 'myvariable' to 1 or 2, depending on the value of 'x'\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lisp\">\n;; Common Lisp\n(let ((x 10))\n  (setq myvariable (if (> x 12) 2 4)))  ; Assigns 'myvariable' to 2\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Haskell====\nIn [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] 98, there is only an ''if expression'', no ''if statement'', and the <code>else</code> part is compulsory, as every expression must have some value.<ref name=\"haskell98report\">''[http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/ Haskell 98 Language and Libraries: The Revised Report]''</ref> Logic that would be expressed with conditionals in other languages is usually expressed with [[pattern matching]] in recursive functions.\n\nBecause Haskell is [[lazy evaluation|lazy]], it is possible to write control structures, such as ''if'', as ordinary expressions; the lazy evaluation means that an ''if function'' can evaluate only the condition and proper branch (where a strict language would evaluate all three). It can be written like this:<ref name=\"haskell-ifthenelse-proposal\">\"[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/If-then-else If-then-else Proposal on HaskellWiki]\"</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nif' :: Bool -> a -> a -> a\nif' True x _ = x\nif' False _ y = y\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====C-like languages====\n[[C (programming language)|C]] and C-like languages have a special [[ternary operator]] ([[?:]]) for conditional expressions with a function that may be described by a template like this:\n <code>condition ? evaluated-when-true : evaluated-when-false</code>\nThis means that it can be inlined into expressions, unlike if-statements, in C-like languages:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nmy_variable = x > 10 ? \"foo\" : \"bar\";  // In C-like languages\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwhich can be compared to the Algol-family if\u2013then\u2013else ''expressions'' (in contrast to a ''statement'') (and similar in Ruby and Scala, among others).\n\nTo accomplish the same using an if-statement, this would take more than one line of code (under typical layout conventions), and require mentioning \"my_variable\" twice:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nif (x > 10)\n    my_variable = \"foo\";\nelse\n    my_variable = \"bar\";\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSome argue that the explicit if/then statement is easier to read and that it may compile to more efficient code than the ternary operator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2009/02/efficient-c-tips-6-dont-use-the-ternary-operator/ |title=Efficient C Tips #6 \u2013 Don\u2019t use the ternary operator \u00ab Stack Overflow |publisher=Embeddedgurus.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref> while others argue that concise expression are easier to read than statements spread over several lines containing repetition.\n\n====In [[Small Basic]]====\n<source lang=vbnet>\nx = TextWindow.ReadNumber()\nIf (x > 10) Then\n    TextWindow.WriteLine(\"My variable is named 'foo'.\")\nElse\n    TextWindow.WriteLine(\"My variable is named 'bar'.\")\nEndIf\n</source>\n\nFirst, when the user runs the program, a cursor appears waiting for the reader to type a number. If that number is greater than 10, the text \"My variable is named 'foo'.\" is displayed on the screen. If the number is smaller than 10, then the message \"My variable is named 'bar'.\" is printed on the screen.\n\n====In Visual Basic====\nIn [[Visual Basic]] and some other languages, a function called <code>[[IIf]]</code> is provided, which can be used as a conditional expression. However, it does not behave like a true conditional expression, because both the true and false branches are always evaluated; it is just that the result of one of them is thrown away, while the result of the other is returned by the IIf function.\n\n=== Arithmetic if ===\nUp to [[Fortran 77]], the language Fortran has an \"arithmetic if\" statement which is halfway between a computed IF and a case statement, based on the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]] {{nowrap|''x'' < 0,}} {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0,}} {{nowrap|''x'' > 0.}} This was the earliest conditional statement in Fortran:<ref name=\"fortran77\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/rjcnf0001-sh-11.html#sh-11.4 |title = American National Standard Programming Language FORTRAN |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |date = 1978-04-03 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011055359/http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/rjcnf0001-sh-11.html#sh-11.4 |archive-date = 2007-10-11 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nIF (e) label1, label2, label3\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhere e is any numeric expression (not necessarily an integer); this is equivalent to\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nIF (e .LT. 0) GOTO label1\nIF (e .EQ. 0) GOTO label2\nGOTO label3\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBecause this [[arithmetic IF]] is equivalent to multiple <code>GOTO</code> statements that could jump to anywhere, it is considered to be an unstructured control statement, and should not be used if more structured statements can be used. In practice it has been observed that most arithmetic <code>IF</code> statements referenced the following statement with one or two of the labels.\n\nThis was the only conditional control statement in the original implementation of Fortran on the [[IBM 704]] computer. On that computer the test-and-branch op-code had three addresses for those three states. Other computers would have \"flag\" registers such as positive, zero, negative, even, overflow, carry, associated with the last arithmetic operations and would use instructions such as 'Branch if accumulator negative' then 'Branch if accumulator zero' or similar. Note that the expression is evaluated ''once only'', and in cases such as integer arithmetic where overflow may occur, the overflow or carry flags would be considered also.\n\n=== Object-oriented implementation in Smalltalk ===\n\nIn contrast to other languages, in [[Smalltalk]] the conditional statement is not a [[language construct]] but defined in the class <code>Boolean</code> as an abstract method that takes two parameters, both [[Closure (computer science)|closure]]s. <code>Boolean</code> has two subclasses, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, which both define the method, <code>True</code> executing the first closure only, <code>False</code> executing the second closure only.<ref name=\"Smalltalk conditionals\">{{cite web |url = http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/VisualWorks/Conditional+Processing |title = VisualWorks: Conditional Processing |date = 2006-12-16 |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022201949/http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/VisualWorks/Conditional+Processing |archive-date = 2007-10-22 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"smalltalk\">\nvar = condition \n    ifTrue: [ 'foo' ]\n    ifFalse: [ 'bar' ]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n=== JavaScript ===\nTwo examples in [[JavaScript]]:\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nif (Math.random() < 0.5) {\n  console.log(\"You got Heads!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"You got Tails!\");\n}\n</source>\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nvar x = Math.random();\nif (x < 1/3) {\n  console.log(\"One person won!\");\n} else if (x < 2/3) {\n  console.log(\"Two people won!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"It's a three-way tie!\");\n}\n</source>\n\n== Lambda Calculus ==\nIn [[Lambda calculus|Lambda Calculus]], the concept of an if-then-else conditional can be expressed using the expressions:\n true = \u03bbx. \u03bby. x\n false = \u03bbx. \u03bby. y\n ifThenElse = (\u03bbc. \u03bbx. \u03bby. (c x y))\n# true takes up to two arguments and once both are provided (see [[currying]]), it returns the first argument given. \n# false takes up to two arguments and once both are provided(see [[currying]]), it returns the second argument given.\n# ifThenElse takes up to three arguments and once all are provided, it passes both second and third argument to the first argument(which is a function that given two arguments, and produces a result). We expect ifThenElse to only take true or false as an argument, both of which project the given two arguments to their preferred single argument, which is then returned. \n'''note''': if ifThenElse is passed two functions as the left and right conditionals; it is '''necessary''' to also pass an empty tuple () to the result of ifThenElse in order to actually call the chosen function, otherwise ifThenElse will just return the function object without getting called.\n\nIn a system where numbers can be used without definition (like Lisp, Traditional paper math, so on), the above can be expressed as a single closure below:\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ((\u03bbtrue. \u03bbfalse. \u03bbifThenElse.\n     (ifThenElse true 2 3)\n )(\u03bbx. \u03bby. x)(\u03bbx. \u03bby. y)(\u03bbc. \u03bbl. \u03bbr. c l r))\n</source>\nHere, true, false, and ifThenElse are bound to their respective definitions which are passed to their scope at the end of their block.\n\nA working JavaScript analogy(using only functions of single variable for rigor) to this is:\n<source lang=\"JavaScript\">\n var computationResult = ((_true => _false => _ifThenElse => \n     _ifThenElse(_true)(2)(3) \n )(x => y => x)(x => y => y)(c => x => y => c(x)(y)));\n</source>\nThe code above with multivariable functions looks like this:\n<source lang=\"JavaScript\">\n var computationResult = ((_true, _false, _ifThenElse) =>\n     _ifThenElse(_true, 2, 3)\n )((x, y) => x, (x, y) => y, (c, x, y) => c(x, y));\n</source>\nanother version of the earlier example without a system where numbers are assumed is below.\n\nFirst example shows the  first branch being taken, while second example shows the second branch being taken.\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n ((\u03bbtrue. \u03bbfalse. \u03bbifThenElse.\n     (ifThenElse true (\u03bbFirstBranch. FirstBranch) (\u03bbSecondBranch.

FirstBranch) (\u03bbSecondBranch.

There is usually a provision for a default action ('else','otherwise') to be taken if no match succeeds. Switch statements can allow [[Optimizing compiler|compiler optimizations]], such as [[lookup table]]s. In dynamic languages, the cases may not be limited to constant expressions, and might extend to [[pattern matching]], as in the [[shell script]] example on the right, where the '*)' implements the default case as a [[regular expression]] matching any string.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]:\n! [[C (programming language)|C]]:\n! [[Shell script]]:\n|-\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\">\ncase someChar of\n  'a': actionOnA;\n  'x': actionOnX;\n  'y','z':actionOnYandZ;\n  else actionOnNoMatch;\nend;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nswitch (someChar) {\n  case 'a': actionOnA; break;\n  case 'x': actionOnX; break;\n  case 'y':\n  case 'z': actionOnYandZ; break;\n  default: actionOnNoMatch;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\ncase $someChar in \n   a)    actionOnA; ;;\n   x)    actionOnX; ;;\n   [yz]) actionOnYandZ; ;;\n  *)     actionOnNoMatch  ;;\nesac\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|}\n\n== Pattern matching ==\n\n{{Main|Pattern matching}}\n\n[[Pattern matching]] may be seen as an alternative to both ''if\u2013then\u2013else'', and ''case'' statements. It is available in many programming languages with functional programming features, such as [[Wolfram Language]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and many others. Here is a simple example written in the [[OCaml]] language:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ocaml\">\nmatch fruit with\n| \"apple\" -> cook pie\n| \"coconut\" -> cook dango_mochi\n| \"banana\" -> mix;;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe power of pattern matching is the ability to ''concisely'' match not only actions but also ''values'' to patterns of data. Here is an example written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] which illustrates both of these features:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nmap _ []      = []\nmap f (h : t) = f h : map f t\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis code defines a function ''map'', which applies the first argument (a function) to each of the elements of the second argument (a list), and returns the resulting list. The two lines are the two definitions of the function for the two kinds of arguments possible in this case \u2013 one where the list is empty (just return an empty list) and the other case where the list is not empty.\n\nPattern matching is not strictly speaking ''always'' a choice construct, because it is possible in Haskell to write only one alternative, which is guaranteed to always be matched \u2013 in this situation, it is not being used as a choice construct, but simply as a way to bind names to values. However, it is frequently used as a choice construct in the languages in which it is available.\n\n== Hash-based conditionals ==\nIn programming languages that have [[associative array]]s or comparable data structures, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Objective-C]], it is idiomatic to use them to implement conditional assignment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codingstyleguide.com/style/180/python-pythonic-way-to-implement-switchcase-statements|title=Pythonic way to implement switch/case statements|access-date=2015-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120120833/http://codingstyleguide.com/style/180/python-pythonic-way-to-implement-switchcase-statements|archive-date=2015-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\npet = raw_input(\"Enter the type of pet you want to name: \")\nknown_pets = {\n    \"Dog\": \"Fido\",\n    \"Cat\": \"Meowsles\",\n    \"Bird\": \"Tweety\",\n}\nmy_name = known_pets[pet]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn languages that have [[anonymous function]]s or that allow a programmer to assign a named function to a variable reference, conditional flow can be implemented by using a hash as a [[dispatch table]].\n\n==Predication==\n{{Main|Branch predication}}\nAn alternative to conditional branch instructions is [[branch predication|predication]]. Predication is an [[Instruction set architecture|architectural]] feature that enables instructions to be conditionally executed instead of modifying the [[control flow]].\n\n== Choice system cross reference ==\n\nThis table refers to the most recent language specification of each language.

''Paul Henry'' launched on 7 April 2015 and initially had an audience larger than the two shows it replaced on radio and TV.

Paul and his mother Olive lived in a council flat.  Olive worked triple shifts in a plastic bag factory to make ends meet.<ref name=wichtel_2006/> Henry says that when he was 25 he discovered that his grandmother was a \"[[Romani people|Gypsy]]\".<ref name=\"wichtel_2006\"/>\n\n==Television and radio career==\n\n===New Zealand===\nHenry has been a radio and television presenter in New Zealand, where he was born and has spent the majority of his career. Henry has been a backup host for current affairs show ''[[Close Up (TV programme)|Close Up]]''. After numerous controversies on morning talk show ''[[Breakfast (TVNZ)|Breakfast]]'' which he hosted between 2004 and 2010, Henry was involved in a high-profile scandal in October 2010 involving his pronunciation and ridicule of the name of Indian politician [[Sheila Dikshit]]. The scandal culminated in Henry's resignation from TVNZ.\n\nPaul Henry started his broadcasting career working for the [[BBC]], as a studio assistant and in the mail room. He worked as a projectionist in the natural history unit, where, according to the ''Sunday Star Times'', \"[[David Attenborough]] would come in and Henry would play the rushes\". Henry returned to New Zealand when he was 19 and worked as a producer on [[National Radio]].<ref name=\"Auto36-6\"/>\nOn radio, Henry worked as a breakfast host on [[Radio Wairarapa|2ZD Radio Wairarapa]] from 1986 to 1990.\n\nHenry left 2ZD to set up his own radio station, 'Today FM 89.3' in 1991, and worked as the breakfast host along with local identity Rick Long, and former 2ZD station manager John (Johnnie) Shearer. Notable employees of TODAY FM included [[Hilary Barry|Hilary Pankurst]] (now Barry), current co-host of [[Seven Sharp]], and [[Georgina Beyer]], who later became the world's first openly transsexual mayor and MP. The radio station had a unique local format including morning talkback with Rick Long. Henry hosted the breakfast show with his former manager, John Shearer.  The breakfast show gave Henry free licence to shamelessly promote his radio station.  His co-host Shearer was often at the receiving end of Henry's jokes.  Henry would famously say he doesn't want to hurt his feelings and every morning when Shearer signed off, Henry would warn listeners to \"take care on the roads now John Shearer's on the roads\". At one time the station even flew a helicopter through the breakfast show with Shearer reporting from the air.\n\nHenry hosted six breakfast shows per week and often worked late at night and right across the weekend at the station, with outside live broadcasts. In 1992, Henry sold the station to the owner of [[Port FM]], which rebranded the station as HITZ 89FM. Today the station exists as [[More FM Wairarapa|More FM 89.5, 105.5 Wairarapa]]. For a time there were three radio stations in Wairarapa, Today FM, Radio Wairarapa and [[Radio Pacific]] where Henry had hosted or co-hosted a breakfast show on each of the stations.\n\nHenry went on to be a foreign correspondent for Radio Pacific and weekend talkback host.\nPaul Henry presented Radio Pacific's Breakfast - \"The Morning Grill\" with [[Arch Tambakis]], then [[Pam Corkery]] in the mid 1990s. Later he was the drive host on [[Radio Pacific]], then later [[Radio Live]] when the station launched in 2005 and again in 2007.\n\nMoving into television, Henry co-hosted TVNZ's ''[[Breakfast (TVNZ)|Breakfast]]'' between 2004 and 2010. In 2009, ratings for the show had improved to around 150,000 viewers from a base of around 100,000.\nHe was also the 2007-2008 host of the New Zealand version of ''[[This Is Your Life (New Zealand TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' and was also supposed to host the 2010 series, but did not, after numerous controversies involving the Breakfast programme. He was later replaced by [[Paul Holmes (broadcaster)|Paul Holmes]].<ref name=\"Auto36-7\"/> \nHenry won the People's Choice Award, Best Presenter at the 2010 Qantas NZ Film and Television Awards.<ref name=\"Auto36-8\"/>\nHis outrageous acceptance speech has attracted more than 300,000 views on YouTube.<ref name=\"Auto36-9\"/>\n\nOn 10 October 2010, following Henry's controversial comments about the New Zealand Governor General, [[Sir Anand Satyanand]], and the Delhi chief minister, [[Sheila Dikshit]], TVNZ announced that Henry had resigned.<ref name=\"resignation\"/><ref name=\"resignation\" /><ref name=\"resignationtvnz\"/><ref name=\"resignationtvnz\" /><ref name=\"Auto36-10\"/> Paul Henry was forced to apologise.<ref name=\"newzealandertsr\"/>\nIn an interview the following month, Henry claimed that TVNZ, in particular chief executive Rick Ellis, had \"capitalised\" on him by encouraging him to be controversial on-air, adding that he believed it was wrong for the New Zealand Government to apologise to India for his remarks.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOn 1 April 2011, it was announced Paul Henry was returning to radio broadcasting with TVNZ's rival Mediaworks. From July that year, Henry replaced [[Maggie Barry]] as the host of [[Radio Live]]'s drivetime show, a position he had held four years previously.<ref name=\"Auto36-11\"/> His tenure in the role would this time last just over half a year; Henry [[#Australia|moved to Australia]] the following year to host [[Network Ten]]'s new morning show.<ref name=\"leavemediaworks\"/> Until this move, Henry was also reported to be working across several high-profile projects on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]],<ref name=\"rejoinmediaworks\"/> including a weekly Sunday evening show with the working title ''The Paul Henry Show'',<ref name=\"newshow\"/> later changed to be a New Zealand edition of the British comedy show ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to you?]]'' which aired in 2012 alongside the production of Henry's Australian show.<ref name=\"leavemediaworks\"/>\n\n===Australia===\nIn February 2012, Henry moved to Sydney, Australia to join [[Network Ten]]'s morning show ''[[Breakfast (Australian TV program)|Breakfast]]'' as co-host.<ref name=\"Auto36-12\"/> The show debuted on 23 February 2012 to low ratings.<ref name=\"Auto36-13\"/> As in New Zealand, Henry's on-air comments caused controversy: in May 2012 he suggested asylum seekers could stay in people's linen cupboards, and implied they were \"dirty\".<ref name=\"Auto36-14\"/>\n\nWhile in Australia, Henry maintained work in New Zealand media as an Australian correspondent for [[Radio Live]] and as the host of ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to you?]]'' on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]<ref name=\"Auto36-15\"/> He made guest appearances on Network Ten programs ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and ''[[The Circle (TV program)|The Circle]]'', and was briefly considered as the host of the second series panel show ''[[Can of Worms (TV program)|Can of Worms]]'', replacing [[Ian Dickson (TV personality)|Ian Dickson]]. However, the role went eventually to [[Chrissie Swan]]<ref name=\"Auto36-16\"/><ref name=\"Auto36-17\"/>\n\nDue to low ratings, Henry's ''Breakfast'' was cancelled on 30 November 2012 after less than one year on air.<ref name=\"Auto36-18\"/> During the show's broadcast period, one of Henry's co-hosts and the show's executive producer quit, prompting speculation about whether the departures were due to tension with Henry.<ref name=\"Auto36-19\"/> A newspaper reported other staff at the network resented Henry, claiming many wouldn't look at him when he walked in the room, and were planning to boycott the Christmas party.<ref name=\"Auto36-20\"/> Both Henry and the low ratings of the show were continually lampooned by the comedy show ''[[The Hamster Wheel]]''.\n\n''Breakfast'''s axing fueled speculation Henry would relocate to New Zealand and [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] to host a revamped edition of ''[[Close Up (TV programme)|Close Up]]''<ref name=\"Auto36-21\"/> Henry was offered the central anchor position on TVNZ's new primetime 7pm current affair programme, later titled ''[[Seven Sharp]]'', but Henry chose instead to honour his existing contract with Mediaworks.<ref name=\"shockdecision\"/>\n\n===Return to New Zealand and semi-retirement===\nIn 2011 Henry published an autobiography,<ref name=\"Auto36-23\" /> ''What Was I Thinking''. The book was a bestseller upon release.<ref name=\"bestseller\" /> In 2013 he released another book, called ''Outraged'' also a bestseller.<ref name=\"Auto36-24\" />\n\nHenry returned to New Zealand after ''Breakfast'' ended; in late 2013 it was revealed that from 2014 Paul Henry would be hosting a late night current affairs show called ''[[The Paul Henry Show]]'', which would replace the long-running ''[[Nightline (New Zealand TV series)|Nightline]]''.<ref name=\"3news.co.nz\" /> ''The Paul Henry Show'' lasted one year; in early October 2014 Henry was announced as the presenter for Mediaworks' new breakfast show to air simultaneously on TV3 and Radio Live. This new venture, entitled ''Paul Henry'', replaces both TV3's ''[[Firstline]]'' and [[Marcus Lush]]'s morning segment on Radio Live.<ref name=\"Auto36-22\" /> In 2016, Henry departed Mediaworks and announced he would be entering a period of \"semi-retirement\", splitting his time between New Zealand and the United States, and producing wine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11931053|title=Why Paul Henry never returned to our screens as promised|date=2017-10-08|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/celebrities/91840485/paul-henry-is-loving-life-after-retiring-from-tv|title=Paul Henry is loving life after retiring from TV|website=Stuff|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spy.nzherald.co.nz/spy-news/no-telly-for-paul-henry-but-plenty-of-wine/|title=No telly for Paul Henry but plenty of wine|last=Simich|first=Ricardo|website=spy.nzherald.co.nz|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n\n=== New show \"Rebuilding Paradise\" ===\nFollowing the effects of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand]], [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] announced a new showing hosted by Henry called \"Rebuilding Paradise\" starting in April 2020.  The show will run four nights per week for four weeks and feature live interviews in regards to the country's response to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]].  This is the first project Henry has taken part in since the announcement of this period of \"semi-retirement\". <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2020/04/paul-henry-rebuilding-paradise-april-20.html|title=Paul Henry's Rebuilding Paradise to premiere April 20 on Three|work=Newshub|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHenry is currently married to entrepreneur Diane Forman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12316570|title=Paul Henry to marry Diane Foreman just a week after his daughter Bella tied the knot|date=2020-03-13|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>  He was previously married to Rachael Hopes (n\u00e9e Orsman<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/3130663/Paul-Henry-rolls-with-the-punches |title=Paul Henry rolls with the punches |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=6 December 2009}}</ref>), with whom he had three children, Lucy, Sophie and Bella.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womensweekly.co.nz/latest/celebrity/paul-henrys-new-life-my-girls-saved-me-7539 |title=Paul Henry\u2019s New Life: My Girls saved me\u2019 |work=[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly|Women's Weekly]] |date=21 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=nzhbig>{{cite news |url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10773816 |title=Mr Big - Paul Henry |work=New Zealand Herald |date=18 December 2011}}</ref>  They have since divorced.

He lost to former radio colleague and [[New Zealand Labour Party]] candidate [[Georgina Beyer]] by 3,033 votes.<ref name=\"Auto36-25\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n=== Female facial hair ===\nIn March 2009, Henry caused offence by pointing out the facial hair of female guest anti-nuclear campaigner and [[Greenpeace]] worker Stephanie Mills. TVNZ stated that it had received a \"handful\" of complaints. Henry stated to the ''Sunday Star Times'': \"I certainly have no intention of apologising to people who have written in and complained. The key thing to me is what a fortunate life they must have that they can afford time and energy to complain about such an insignificant thing.\"<ref name=\"Auto36-26\"/>\n\n=== Views on homosexuality ===\nIn August 2009, Henry referred to homosexuals as \"unnatural\", prompting a complaint to the [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]], which regulates broadcast radio and television content within New Zealand. In February 2010, the Broadcasting Standards Authority declined to uphold the complaint.<ref name=\"Auto36-27\"/>\n\n=== Susan Boyle ===\nIn November 2009, Henry sparked controversy when he called singer [[Susan Boyle]] 'retarded'. His comments led to almost 200 complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority and an apology from Television New Zealand.<ref name=\"Auto36-28\"/>\n\n=== Governor-General of New Zealand Sir Anand Satyanand ===\n\nIn October 2010, Henry was again the subject of complaints after a live broadcast in which he asked Prime Minister [[John Key]] whether the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], [[Anand Satyanand|Sir Anand Satyanand]], was \"even a New Zealander\".  Henry went on to ask \"Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time\"....\"are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?\"<ref name=\"newzealandertsr\"/><ref name=\"newzealanderstuff\"/> Anand is of Indian descent but was born and raised in Auckland. Henry was criticised by Key, Labour leader [[Phil Goff]] and race relations commissioner Joris de Bres. Henry later apologised for his comments.<ref name=\"newzealandertsr\" /><ref name=\"newzealanderafp\"/> After initially expressing its support for Henry, TVNZ announced the following day that it had suspended the presenter for two weeks without pay.<ref name=\"suspensiontsr\"/>\n\n=== Sheila Dikshit ===\nFollowing the decision to suspend Henry, TVNZ continued to air a clip in which Henry referred to [[Delhi]]'s chief minister [[Sheila Dikshit]] during the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] as \"the dipshit woman\" and even pronouncing her surname as \"Dick Shit\" instead of \"Dixit\", going on to state that \"it's so appropriate, because she's Indian, so she'd be dick-in-shit wouldn't she, do you know what I mean? Walking along the street... it's just so funny.\"<ref name=\"indiacomment\"/> New Zealand Indian Central Association president Paul Singh Bains said the fact that TVNZ was still \"promoting\" the clip on its website showed it had \"totally lost the plot\" and was insensitive to the offence Henry had caused.<ref name=\"indexp\"/>\nFollowing at least four complaints against the video, TVNZ removed it from the \"Video extras\" section of their website.<ref name=\"indexp\"/> Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of [[political correctness]], and critics accusing him of pandering to the [[Sensationalism|lowest common denominator]].<ref name=\"Auto36-29\"/>\n\nIndia summoned New Zealand's high commissioner Rupert Holborow to protest against Henry's \"[[racist]] and bigoted\" comments, and Holborow expressed his regret for the \"deep hurt\" they had caused.<ref name=\"Auto36-30\"/>\n\n===Asylum seekers===\nOn 16 May 2012, Henry was criticised for comments made on ''[[Breakfast (Australian TV program)|Breakfast]]'' regarding asylum seekers. When commenting on a newspaper article, about the Australian Government offering families money to house asylum seekers, Henry suggested that the idea could be \"broadened out\" saying: \"I mean if this is all about saving money you could broaden it out. Why not criminals? Not murderers, but low level criminals. You could - the jails could be smaller and you could put them in homestay situations. The mentally ill\". He later suggested the asylum seekers could be housed in linen cupboards. His remarks were featured on ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]''.<ref name=\"Auto36-32\"/>\n\nHenry caused further controversy on 27 August 2012 by suggesting on the programme that Asylum Seekers should \"starve to death\" following reports that they would be conducting a [[hunger strike]] over plans to shift them to Nauru. He issued an apology the following morning following public backlash on Twitter.<ref name=\"Auto36-33\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of New Zealand television personalities]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Auto36-1\">{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/ten-set-to-axe-breakfast-125279|title=Ten to axe Breakfast|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Mumbrella|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/ten-orders-controversial-kiwi-for-breakfast-20111105-1n17g.html//Default.aspx|title=Ten orders controversial Kiwi for breakfast|date=5 November 2011|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10817968//Default.aspx|title=Paul Henry left holding fort as colleagues bail out|date=7 July 2012|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/paul-henry/biography|title=Paul Henry|publisher=NZ On Screen|accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-5\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PaulHenryShow/videos/770445316421787/ |title=Facebook |publisher=[[Facebook]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=wichtel_2006>{{cite journal |last1=Wichtel |first1=Diana |date=23\u201329 December 2006 |title=Close Up & personal |journal=New Zealand Listener |volume=206 |issue=3476 |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/uncategorized/close-up-personal/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-6\">{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/2812861/The-man-who-eats-guests-for-breakfast |title=The man who eats guests for breakfast |newspaper=The Sunday Star Times  |publisher=Fairfax NZ Ltd |author= Kim Knight |date=30 August 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2010  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10678313//Default.aspx|title=Paul Henry Suspended|date=5 October 2010|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-8\">{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv/4145576/Paul-Henrys-outrageous-awards-speech |title=Paul Henry's outrageous awards speech |newspaper= Stuff |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand Ltd |accessdate=7 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Auto36-9\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu1eWIGo-XI |title=Paul Henry Acceptance Speech -

''Paul Henry'' launched on 7 April 2015 and initially had an audience larger than the two shows it replaced on radio and TV. For nine months in 2012, he also co-hosted an Australian television show, ''[[Breakfast (Australian TV program)|Breakfast]]'', which ceased production on 30 November 2012, due to low ratings.<ref name=\"Auto36-1\"/><ref name=\"Auto36-2\"/><ref name=\"Auto36-3\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Henry Hopes was born in [[Auckland]], New Zealand,<ref name=\"Auto36-4\"/> to Brian and Olive Hopes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/5190325/What-Paul-Henry-was-thinking |title=What Paul Henry was thinking |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=25 June 2011}}</ref> on 4 August 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Paul-Henry-opens-birthday-gifts-from-Rob-Fyfe/tabid/734/articleID/22192/Default.aspx |title=Paul Henry opens birthday gifts from Rob Fyfe |work=[[Radio Live]] |date=4 August 2011 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803201308/http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Paul-Henry-opens-birthday-gifts-from-Rob-Fyfe/tabid/734/articleID/22192/Default.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  He attended Cockle Bay Primary in Howick, Auckland.<ref name=\"Auto36-5\"/>  His parents separated when he was 11, and in 1971 he moved with his English-born mother to [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, where he finished his education and won a drama school scholarship.  Paul and his mother Olive lived in a council flat.  Olive worked triple shifts in a plastic bag factory to make ends meet.<ref name=wichtel_2006/> Henry says that when he was 25 he discovered that his grandmother was a \"[[Romani people|Gypsy]]\".<ref name=\"wichtel_2006\"/>\n\n==Television and radio career==\n\n===New Zealand===\nHenry has been a radio and television presenter in New Zealand, where he was born and has spent the majority of his career. Henry has been a backup host for current affairs show ''[[Close Up (TV programme)|Close Up]]''. After numerous controversies on morning talk show ''[[Breakfast (TVNZ)|Breakfast]]'' which he hosted between 2004 and 2010, Henry was involved in a high-profile scandal in October 2010 involving his pronunciation and ridicule of the name of Indian politician [[Sheila Dikshit]]. The scandal culminated in Henry's resignation from TVNZ.\n\nPaul Henry started his broadcasting career working for the [[BBC]], as a studio assistant and in the mail room. He worked as a projectionist in the natural history unit, where, according to the ''Sunday Star Times'', \"[[David Attenborough]] would come in and Henry would play the rushes\". Henry returned to New Zealand when he was 19 and worked as a producer on [[National Radio]].<ref name=\"Auto36-6\"/>\nOn radio, Henry worked as a breakfast host on [[Radio Wairarapa|2ZD Radio Wairarapa]] from 1986 to 1990.\n\nHenry left 2ZD to set up his own radio station, 'Today FM 89.3' in 1991, and worked as the breakfast host along with local identity Rick Long, and former 2ZD station manager John (Johnnie) Shearer. Notable employees of TODAY FM included [[Hilary Barry|Hilary Pankurst]] (now Barry), current co-host of [[Seven Sharp]], and [[Georgina Beyer]], who later became the world's first openly transsexual mayor and MP. The radio station had a unique local format including morning talkback with Rick Long. Henry hosted the breakfast show with his former manager, John Shearer.  The breakfast show gave Henry free licence to shamelessly promote his radio station.  His co-host Shearer was often at the receiving end of Henry's jokes.  Henry would famously say he doesn't want to hurt his feelings and every morning when Shearer signed off, Henry would warn listeners to \"take care on the roads now John Shearer's on the roads\". At one time the station even flew a helicopter through the breakfast show with Shearer reporting from the air.\n\nHenry hosted six breakfast shows per week and often worked late at night and right across the weekend at the station, with outside live broadcasts. In 1992, Henry sold the station to the owner of [[Port FM]], which rebranded the station as HITZ 89FM. Today the station exists as [[More FM Wairarapa|More FM 89.5, 105.5 Wairarapa]]. For a time there were three radio stations in Wairarapa, Today FM, Radio Wairarapa and [[Radio Pacific]] where Henry had hosted or co-hosted a breakfast show on each of the stations.\n\nHenry went on to be a foreign correspondent for Radio Pacific and weekend talkback host.\nPaul Henry presented Radio Pacific's Breakfast - \"The Morning Grill\" with [[Arch Tambakis]], then [[Pam Corkery]] in the mid 1990s. Later he was the drive host on [[Radio Pacific]], then later [[Radio Live]] when the station launched in 2005 and again in 2007.\n\nMoving into television, Henry co-hosted TVNZ's ''[[Breakfast (TVNZ)|Breakfast]]'' between 2004 and 2010. In 2009, ratings for the show had improved to around 150,000 viewers from a base of around 100,000.\nHe was also the 2007-2008 host of the New Zealand version of ''[[This Is Your Life (New Zealand TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' and was also supposed to host the 2010 series, but did not, after numerous controversies involving the Breakfast programme. He was later replaced by [[Paul Holmes (broadcaster)|Paul Holmes]].<ref name=\"Auto36-7\"/> \nHenry won the People's Choice Award, Best Presenter at the 2010 Qantas NZ Film and Television Awards.<ref name=\"Auto36-8\"/>\nHis outrageous acceptance speech has attracted more than 300,000 views on YouTube.<ref name=\"Auto36-9\"/>\n\nOn 10 October 2010, following Henry's controversial comments about the New Zealand Governor General, [[Sir Anand Satyanand]], and the Delhi chief minister, [[Sheila Dikshit]], TVNZ announced that Henry had resigned.<ref name=\"resignation\"/><ref name=\"resignation\" /><ref name=\"resignationtvnz\"/><ref name=\"resignationtvnz\" /><ref name=\"Auto36-10\"/> Paul Henry was forced to apologise.<ref name=\"newzealandertsr\"/>\nIn an interview the following month, Henry claimed that TVNZ, in particular chief executive Rick Ellis, had \"capitalised\" on him by encouraging him to be controversial on-air, adding that he believed it was wrong for the New Zealand Government to apologise to India for his remarks.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOn 1 April 2011, it was announced Paul Henry was returning to radio broadcasting with TVNZ's rival Mediaworks. From July that year, Henry replaced [[Maggie Barry]] as the host of [[Radio Live]]'s drivetime show, a position he had held four years previously.<ref name=\"Auto36-11\"/> His tenure in the role would this time last just over half a year; Henry [[#Australia|moved to Australia]] the following year to host [[Network Ten]]'s new morning show.<ref name=\"leavemediaworks\"/> Until this move, Henry was also reported to be working across several high-profile projects on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]],<ref name=\"rejoinmediaworks\"/> including a weekly Sunday evening show with the working title ''The Paul Henry Show'',<ref name=\"newshow\"/> later changed to be a New Zealand edition of the British comedy show ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to you?]]'' which aired in 2012 alongside the production of Henry's Australian show.<ref name=\"leavemediaworks\"/>\n\n===Australia===\nIn February 2012, Henry moved to Sydney, Australia to join [[Network Ten]]'s morning show ''[[Breakfast (Australian TV program)|Breakfast]]'' as co-host.<ref name=\"Auto36-12\"/> The show debuted on 23 February 2012 to low ratings.<ref name=\"Auto36-13\"/> As in New Zealand, Henry's on-air comments caused controversy: in May 2012 he suggested asylum seekers could stay in people's linen cupboards, and implied they were \"dirty\".<ref name=\"Auto36-14\"/>\n\nWhile in Australia, Henry maintained work in New Zealand media as an Australian correspondent for [[Radio Live]] and as the host of ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to you?]]'' on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]<ref name=\"Auto36-15\"/> He made guest appearances on Network Ten programs ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and ''[[The Circle (TV program)|The Circle]]'', and was briefly considered as the host of the second series panel show ''[[Can of Worms (TV program)|Can of Worms]]'', replacing [[Ian Dickson (TV personality)|Ian Dickson]]. However, the role went eventually to [[Chrissie Swan]]<ref name=\"Auto36-16\"/><ref name=\"Auto36-17\"/>\n\nDue to low ratings, Henry's ''Breakfast'' was cancelled on 30 November 2012 after less than one year on air.<ref name=\"Auto36-18\"/> During the show's broadcast period, one of Henry's co-hosts and the show's executive producer quit, prompting speculation about whether the departures were due to tension with Henry.<ref name=\"Auto36-19\"/> A newspaper reported other staff at the network resented Henry, claiming many wouldn't look at him when he walked in the room, and were planning to boycott the Christmas party.<ref name=\"Auto36-20\"/> Both Henry and the low ratings of the show were continually lampooned by the comedy show ''[[The Hamster Wheel]]''.\n\n''Breakfast'''s axing fueled speculation Henry would relocate to New Zealand and [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] to host a revamped edition of ''[[Close Up (TV programme)|Close Up]]''<ref name=\"Auto36-21\"/> Henry was offered the central anchor position on TVNZ's new primetime 7pm current affair programme, later titled ''[[Seven Sharp]]'', but Henry chose instead to honour his existing contract with Mediaworks.<ref name=\"shockdecision\"/>\n\n===Return to New Zealand and semi-retirement===\nIn 2011 Henry published an autobiography,<ref name=\"Auto36-23\" /> ''What Was I Thinking''. The book was a bestseller upon release.<ref name=\"bestseller\" /> In 2013 he released another book, called ''Outraged'' also a bestseller.<ref name=\"Auto36-24\" />\n\nHenry returned to New Zealand after ''Breakfast'' ended; in late 2013 it was revealed that from 2014 Paul Henry would be hosting a late night current affairs show called ''[[The Paul Henry Show]]'', which would replace the long-running ''[[Nightline (New Zealand TV series)|Nightline]]''.<ref name=\"3news.co.nz\" /> ''The Paul Henry Show'' lasted one year; in early October 2014 Henry was announced as the presenter for Mediaworks' new breakfast show to air simultaneously on TV3 and Radio Live. This new venture, entitled ''Paul Henry'', replaces both TV3's ''[[Firstline]]'' and [[Marcus Lush]]'s morning segment on Radio Live.<ref name=\"Auto36-22\" /> In 2016, Henry departed Mediaworks and announced he would be entering a period of \"semi-retirement\", splitting his time between New Zealand and the United States, and producing wine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11931053|title=Why Paul Henry never returned to our screens as promised|date=2017-10-08|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/celebrities/91840485/paul-henry-is-loving-life-after-retiring-from-tv|title=Paul Henry is loving life after retiring from TV|website=Stuff|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spy.nzherald.co.nz/spy-news/no-telly-for-paul-henry-but-plenty-of-wine/|title=No telly for Paul Henry but plenty of wine|last=Simich|first=Ricardo|website=spy.nzherald.co.nz|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n\n=== New show \"Rebuilding Paradise\" ===\nFollowing the effects of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand]], [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] announced a new showing hosted by Henry called \"Rebuilding Paradise\" starting in April 2020.  The show will run four nights per week for four weeks and feature live interviews in regards to the country's response to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]].  This is the first project Henry has taken part in since the announcement of this period of \"semi-retirement\". <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2020/04/paul-henry-rebuilding-paradise-april-20.html|title=Paul Henry's Rebuilding Paradise to premiere April 20 on Three|work=Newshub|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHenry is currently married to entrepreneur Diane Forman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12316570|title=Paul Henry to marry Diane Foreman just a week after his daughter Bella tied the knot|date=2020-03-13|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>  He was previously married to Rachael Hopes (n\u00e9e Orsman<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/3130663/Paul-Henry-rolls-with-the-punches |title=Paul Henry rolls with the punches |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=6 December 2009}}</ref>), with whom he had three children, Lucy, Sophie and Bella.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womensweekly.co.nz/latest/celebrity/paul-henrys-new-life-my-girls-saved-me-7539 |title=Paul Henry\u2019s New Life: My Girls saved me\u2019 |work=[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly|Women's Weekly]] |date=21 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=nzhbig>{{cite news |url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10773816 |title=Mr Big - Paul Henry |work=New Zealand Herald |date=18 December 2011}}</ref>  They have since divorced.

He lost to former radio colleague and [[New Zealand Labour Party]] candidate [[Georgina Beyer]] by 3,033 votes.<ref name=\"Auto36-25\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n=== Female facial hair ===\nIn March 2009, Henry caused offence by pointing out the facial hair of female guest anti-nuclear campaigner and [[Greenpeace]] worker Stephanie Mills. TVNZ stated that it had received a \"handful\" of complaints. Henry stated to the ''Sunday Star Times'': \"I certainly have no intention of apologising to people who have written in and complained. The key thing to me is what a fortunate life they must have that they can afford time and energy to complain about such an insignificant thing.\"<ref name=\"Auto36-26\"/>\n\n=== Views on homosexuality ===\nIn August 2009, Henry referred to homosexuals as \"unnatural\", prompting a complaint to the [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]], which regulates broadcast radio and television content within New Zealand. In February 2010, the Broadcasting Standards Authority declined to uphold the complaint.<ref name=\"Auto36-27\"/>\n\n=== Susan Boyle ===\nIn November 2009, Henry sparked controversy when he called singer [[Susan Boyle]] 'retarded'. His comments led to almost 200 complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority and an apology from Television New Zealand.<ref name=\"Auto36-28\"/>\n\n=== Governor-General of New Zealand Sir Anand Satyanand ===\n\nIn October 2010, Henry was again the subject of complaints after a live broadcast in which he asked Prime Minister [[John Key]] whether the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], [[Anand Satyanand|Sir Anand Satyanand]], was \"even a New Zealander\".  Henry went on to ask \"Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time\"....\"are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?\"<ref name=\"newzealandertsr\"/><ref name=\"newzealanderstuff\"/> Anand is of Indian descent but was born and raised in Auckland. Henry was criticised by Key, Labour leader [[Phil Goff]] and race relations commissioner Joris de Bres. Henry later apologised for his comments.<ref name=\"newzealandertsr\" /><ref name=\"newzealanderafp\"/> After initially expressing its support for Henry, TVNZ announced the following day that it had suspended the presenter for two weeks without pay.<ref name=\"suspensiontsr\"/>\n\n=== Sheila Dikshit ===\nFollowing the decision to suspend Henry, TVNZ continued to air a clip in which Henry referred to [[Delhi]]'s chief minister [[Sheila Dikshit]] during the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] as \"the dipshit woman\" and even pronouncing her surname as \"Dick Shit\" instead of \"Dixit\", going on to state that \"it's so appropriate, because she's Indian, so she'd be dick-in-shit wouldn't she, do you know what I mean? Walking along the street... it's just so funny.\"<ref name=\"indiacomment\"/> New Zealand Indian Central Association president Paul Singh Bains said the fact that TVNZ was still \"promoting\" the clip on its website showed it had \"totally lost the plot\" and was insensitive to the offence Henry had caused.<ref name=\"indexp\"/>\nFollowing at least four complaints against the video, TVNZ removed it from the \"Video extras\" section of their website.<ref name=\"indexp\"/> Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of [[political correctness]], and critics accusing him of pandering to the [[Sensationalism|lowest common denominator]].<ref name=\"Auto36-29\"/>\n\nIndia summoned New Zealand's high commissioner Rupert Holborow to protest against Henry's \"[[racist]] and bigoted\" comments, and Holborow expressed his regret for the \"deep hurt\" they had caused.<ref name=\"Auto36-30\"/>\n\n===Asylum seekers===\nOn 16 May 2012, Henry was criticised for comments made on ''[[Breakfast (Australian TV program)|Breakfast]]'' regarding asylum seekers. When commenting on a newspaper article, about the Australian Government offering families money to house asylum seekers, Henry suggested that the idea could be \"broadened out\" saying: \"I mean if this is all about saving money you could broaden it out. Why not criminals? Not murderers, but low level criminals. You could - the jails could be smaller and you could put them in homestay situations. The mentally ill\". He later suggested the asylum seekers could be housed in linen cupboards.
