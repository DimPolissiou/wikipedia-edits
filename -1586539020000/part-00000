The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The cast includes [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Rob Lowe]], and [[Tina Fey]].  The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.\n\nMark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favor to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.\n\nThe next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster [[14th century]]), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 \u2014 the amount he owed his landlord \u2014 in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a [[casino]], and writes a [[screenplay]] about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him due to how his genetics/appearance would not be a good factor in how she wants her child to be/look like.\n\nMark then gets a call that his mother, Martha, has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that Martha is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through \"ten rules\" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a \"Man In The Sky\" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three \"[[sin|bad things]]\".\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says \"No\". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it \"wouldn't count\". Anna confesses that she loves him.\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Mark Bellison\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Anna McDoogles\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Brad Kessler\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Greg Kleinschmidt\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Frank Fawcett\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Nathan Goldfrappe\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Shelley Bailey\n* [[Roz Ryan]] as Nurse Barbara\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Anthony James\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Bob Scott\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Martha Bellison\n* [[Shaun Williamson]] as Richard Bellison\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bellison's Assistant\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Receptionist\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Waiter\n* [[Donald Foley]] as Yelling Man\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Wedding Overseer\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as News Reporter\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Blonde Woman on the Street\n* [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] as Person #4\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Doctor (cameo)\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Man at the Door (cameo)\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jim The Bartender (cameo)\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Traffic Cop (cameo)\n* [[Karl Pilkington]] as Cave Man (cameo)\n* [[Eric Andre]] as Mansion Man (cameo)\n* [[Donna Sorbello]] as Anna's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]\u2019s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the \u201cmost liked\u201d un-produced scripts in Hollywood.<ref name=BlackList>{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |accessdate=2018-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-07 }}</ref> Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest.

But before this all came about K-Solo spent 16 months in Riverhead Correctional Facility after being wrongfully convicted of assault in the 1980s. In Suffolk jail is where K-Solo came up with the Spellbound flow. Mr. Myles was there to see him write it.That was before he transferred to the city jail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone|title=K-Solo: Fuck Everyone|publisher=HipHopDX|author=Clark, Kevin|date=January 10, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122231954/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone|archive-date=November 22, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s he signed with Death Row Records and almost signed to [[Death Row East]] after hooking up with them in a Pittsburgh concert show. The only track ever released was a bootleg of Kurupt and him freestyling over Snoop's \"Gin and Juice\". It can be found on YouTube.\n\nIn 2003 he toured the world with PMD and DJ Honda and vowed never again citing PMD \"flipping over nearly everything but his ticket and record sales.\"\n\nIn 2004 he was working on a new album for his Waste Management Records tentatively titled \"There Will Be Hell to Pay\" which has yet to be released.\n\n==Feuds==\n\n===DMX===\nDuring the mid-1990s through the early 2000s (decade), [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and K-Solo, who first met as inmates in prison during the course of K-Solo's three-year prison stint, disputed over who was the first to write \"Spellbound\".  Despite that K-Solo released his version in 1990, DMX, who released his version in 1994, claimed that he was the first to write \"Spellbound\". In his 1998 hit single \"[[Get At Me Dog]]\", DMX told K-Solo to \"suck [his] dick\". K-Solo later responded to DMX on a track named \"The Answer Back\", in which K-Solo claimed to be DMX's real father, and alleged that the legitimate reason for DMX's disgruntlement was because K-Solo had given DMX's mother a sexually transmitted infection. As the track continues, K-Solo went on to vindicate himself by saying that it was in fact DMX's mother that had \"burned\" him first. On [[Beef II]], K-Solo took a lie detector test to prove that he was the first to write \"Spellbound\". The results were inconclusive.\n\nIn an August 2006 interview with [https://web.archive.org/web/20080525211051/http://www.platform8470.com/artists/ai_ksolo.asp] he had this to say:\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that being in L.A., I have people that I never would in LA, like [[Tito Ortiz]], [[Chuck Lidell]], true beat-that-ass-niggas. I have personally talked to the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] folks and they would love to see us fight, I would love to see us fight. I mean we are forever going to be linked in the beef shit because there has not been a clear winner. I feel that I destroyed him, I assume he feels the same. It\u2019s obvious we both don\u2019t like each other and I think it\u2019s the only way to settle this beef, but let\u2019s face it, I saw dude do 50 push-ups and almost fall down afterwards. It took like 10 minutes to catch his breath to smoke another [[cigarette]]. Obviously he is not ready for that. It would be the biggest deal in hip-hop in 20 years.\"\n\nIn a January 2007 interview with [http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone]  was asked why DMX has continued to fan the flames such as his recent appearance on Hot 97 and stated:\n\n\"He knows what it is. I told him to get into the cage with me. Five rounds, homie, fight me! He wouldn't do it. I am asking Keith Murray to do the same. I\u2019ll break his ass down in two. He\u2019s a five dollar dude. Sign the papers, we\u2019ll set it up, and can handle it. That goes for any ma\u2019fucka who has problems with me. We\u2019ll get in the cage. If you can beat me, you get the money and I\u2019ll get my ass beat. Let people do what they got to do. I\u2019m in war mode. I\u2019m more ready now than I've ever been. People aren't getting away with that dumb shit. DMX can\u2019t fight.\"\n\n===Keith Murray===\nIn a January 2007 interview [http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone] responded to claims that he [Keith] knocked him out:\n\n\"I was in the hood watching these guys. I ran with one of these guys who was in the hood. A while back, my boy \u2013 Ralph Mann got jumped by a few of the L.O.D. cats [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]]\u2019s crew]. They were disrespecting Ralph! I put Murray and Redman in the game! So, I put they asses on blast on a mixtape! Murray\u2019s men jumped me on stage and threw me off the bitch. They\u2019re now in court because of the shit. But let me ask you -- how do I get jumped in your club on Christmas Eve and walk out still alright? I could\u2019ve respected it if Murray ran up on me and did his thing. But he didn\u2019t. He thinks that the world is against him. If there was no Kevin Madison there wouldn\u2019t be no Keith Murray, because no one would\u2019ve respected him. Why fight someone that put you on? The only thing that I can think is that Reggie and Erick put him on to doing it. These cats are crazy, though. People were hurt when the [[Hit Squad]] broke up. I know people who can call on [[J.

But before this all came about K-Solo spent 16 months in Riverhead Correctional Facility after being wrongfully convicted of assault in the 1980s. In Suffolk jail is where K-Solo came up with the Spellbound flow. Mr. Myles was there to see him write it.That was before he transferred to the city jail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone|title=K-Solo: Fuck Everyone|publisher=HipHopDX|author=Clark, Kevin|date=January 10, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122231954/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone|archive-date=November 22, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s he signed with Death Row Records and almost signed to [[Death Row East]] after hooking up with them in a Pittsburgh concert show. The only track ever released was a bootleg of Kurupt and him freestyling over Snoop's \"Gin and Juice\". It can be found on YouTube.\n\nIn 2003 he toured the world with PMD and DJ Honda and vowed never again citing PMD \"flipping over nearly everything but his ticket and record sales.\"\n\nIn 2004 he was working on a new album for his Waste Management Records tentatively titled \"There Will Be Hell to Pay\" which has yet to be released.\n\n==Feuds==\n\n===DMX===\nDuring the mid-1990s through the early 2000s (decade), [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and K-Solo, who first met as inmates in prison during the course of K-Solo's three-year prison stint, disputed over who was the first to write \"Spellbound\".  Despite that K-Solo released his version in 1990, DMX, who released his version in 1994, claimed that he was the first to write \"Spellbound\". In his 1998 hit single \"[[Get At Me Dog]]\", DMX told K-Solo to \"suck [his] dick\". K-Solo later responded to DMX on a track named \"The Answer Back\", in which K-Solo claimed to be DMX's real father, and alleged that the legitimate reason for DMX's disgruntlement was because K-Solo had given DMX's mother a sexually transmitted infection. As the track continues, K-Solo went on to vindicate himself by saying that it was in fact DMX's mother that had \"burned\" him first. On [[Beef II]], K-Solo took a lie detector test to prove that he was the first to write \"Spellbound\". The results were inconclusive.\n\nIn an August 2006 interview with [https://web.archive.org/web/20080525211051/http://www.platform8470.com/artists/ai_ksolo.asp] he had this to say:\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that being in L.A., I have people that I never would in LA, like [[Tito Ortiz]], [[Chuck Lidell]], true beat-that-ass-niggas. I have personally talked to the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] folks and they would love to see us fight, I would love to see us fight. I mean we are forever going to be linked in the beef shit because there has not been a clear winner. I feel that I destroyed him, I assume he feels the same. It\u2019s obvious we both don\u2019t like each other and I think it\u2019s the only way to settle this beef, but let\u2019s face it, I saw dude do 50 push-ups and almost fall down afterwards. It took like 10 minutes to catch his breath to smoke another [[cigarette]]. Obviously he is not ready for that. It would be the biggest deal in hip-hop in 20 years.\"\n\nIn a January 2007 interview with [http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone]  was asked why DMX has continued to fan the flames such as his recent appearance on Hot 97 and stated:\n\n\"He knows what it is. I told him to get into the cage with me. Five rounds, homie, fight me! He wouldn't do it. I am asking Keith Murray to do the same. I\u2019ll break his ass down in two. He\u2019s a five dollar dude. Sign the papers, we\u2019ll set it up, and can handle it. That goes for any ma\u2019fucka who has problems with me. We\u2019ll get in the cage. If you can beat me, you get the money and I\u2019ll get my ass beat. Let people do what they got to do. I\u2019m in war mode. I\u2019m more ready now than I've ever been. People aren't getting away with that dumb shit. DMX can\u2019t fight.\"\n\n===Keith Murray===\nIn a January 2007 interview [http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.697/title.k-solo-fuck-everyone] responded to claims that he [Keith] knocked him out:\n\n\"I was in the hood watching these guys. I ran with one of these guys who was in the hood. A while back, my boy \u2013 Ralph Mann got jumped by a few of the L.O.D. cats [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]]\u2019s crew]. They were disrespecting Ralph! I put Murray and Redman in the game! So, I put they asses on blast on a mixtape! Murray\u2019s men jumped me on stage and threw me off the bitch. They\u2019re now in court because of the shit. But let me ask you -- how do I get jumped in your club on Christmas Eve and walk out still alright? I could\u2019ve respected it if Murray ran up on me and did his thing. But he didn\u2019t. He thinks that the world is against him. If there was no Kevin Madison there wouldn\u2019t be no Keith Murray, because no one would\u2019ve respected him. Why fight someone that put you on? The only thing that I can think is that Reggie and Erick put him on to doing it. These cats are crazy, though. People were hurt when the [[Hit Squad]] broke up. I know people who can call on [[J. Prince]] and really cause some problems. Cats are just stupid. That\u2019s the only thing that aggravates me.

The purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock; in exchange, the railroads received NRPC common stock.\n* Any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after May 1, 1971, except for those services chosen by the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] (DOT) as part of a \"basic system\" of service and paid for by NRPC using its federal funds.\n* Railroads that chose not to join the NRPC system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975 and thenceforth had to pursue the customary ICC approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service.\n\nOf the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970, only six declined to join Amtrak.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanders|2006|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> Nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived.

While the NEC ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system, the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming.

Amtrak services fall into three groups: short-haul service on the Northeast Corridor, state-supported short haul service outside the Northeast Corridor, and medium- and long-haul service known within Amtrak as the National Network. Amtrak receives federal funding for the vast majority of its operations including the central spine of the Northeast Corridor as well as for its National Network routes. In addition to the federally funded routes, Amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the Northeast Corridor, some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it. In addition to its inter-city services, Amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including [[MARC Train|MARC]] in Maryland, [[Shore Line East]] in Connecticut, and [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] in California.\n\n[[File:NYC Penn Station 7th Avenue Entrance 2013.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[New York City]]'s [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], Amtrak's busiest station by boardings.]]\nService on the Northeast Corridor, between [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], is powered by overhead electric wires; for the rest of the system, diesel locomotives are used.

The NEC runs from Boston to Washington, D.C., via New York City and Philadelphia. Some services continue into [[Virginia]]. The NEC services accounted for 12.1&nbsp;million of Amtrak's 31.7&nbsp;million passengers in [[fiscal year]] 2018.<ref name=\"FY18 profile\" /> Outside the NEC the most popular services are the short-haul corridors in California. These include the ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', ''[[Capitol Corridor]]'', and ''[[San Joaquin (train)|San Joaquin]]'', supplemented by an extensive network of connecting buses. Together the California corridor trains accounted for a combined 5,731,795 passengers in fiscal year 2018.<ref name=\"FY18 profile\" /> Other popular corridors include the [[Empire Corridor]], which consists of trackage between New York City and [[Niagara Falls, New York]], via [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, and carried 1,517,194 passengers in fiscal year 2018, and the ''[[Keystone Service]]'' from New York City to Harrisburg via Philadelphia that carried 1,519,936 passengers that same year.<ref name=\"FY18 profile\" />\n\nFour of the six busiest stations by boardings are on the NEC: [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York (Penn Station)]] (first), [[Washington Union Station|Washington (Union Station)]] (second), [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia (30th Street Station)]] (third), and [[South Station|Boston (South Station)]] (fifth).

However, because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work, some critics, such as the [[National Association of Railroad Passengers]], maintain that Amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as US$150 million/year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narprail.org/resources/fact-sheets/328-amtrak-myths-a-facts |title=Amtrak Myths & Facts: 4.

In 1997 Congress released Amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation (and outside its unions), opening the door to privatization.<ref>''Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997.'' 105th Cong. (January 7, 1997)</ref> Since that time, many of Amtrak's employees have been working without a contract. The most recent contract, signed in 1999, was mainly retroactive.\n\nBecause of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job, {{as of|2009|lc=y}} Amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with. Plus, it has 24 separate contracts with those unions.<ref name=\"redortibit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/934121/sidetracked_negotiations_the_contract_for_nearly_10000_unionized_amtrak_employees/index.html |title=Sidetracked Negotiations: The Contract for Nearly 10,000 Unionized Amtrak Employees Expired on December 31, 1999.

In fiscal 2004 and 2005, Congress appropriated about $1.2&nbsp;billion for Amtrak, $300&nbsp;million more than President [[George W. Bush]] had requested. However, the company's board requested $1.8&nbsp;billion through fiscal 2006, the majority of which (about $1.3&nbsp;billion) would be used to bring infrastructure, rolling stock, and motive power back to a state of good repair. In Congressional testimony, the DOT Inspector General confirmed that Amtrak would need at least $1.4&nbsp;billion to $1.5&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2006 and $2&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo. In 2006, Amtrak received just under $1.4&nbsp;billion, with the condition that Amtrak would reduce (but not eliminate) food and sleeper service losses. Thus, dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers. Only ''[[Auto Train]]'' and ''[[Empire Builder]]'' services continue regular made-on-board meal service.

In late 1969 multiple proposals emerged in the [[United States Congress]], including equipment subsidies, route subsidies, and, lastly, a \"quasi-public corporation\" to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains. Matters were brought to a head on June 21, 1970, when the [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], the largest railroad in the [[Northeast United States]] and teetering on bankruptcy, filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trains.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanders|2006|pp=1\u20133}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1970, Congress passed, and President [[Richard Nixon]] signed into law, the Rail Passenger Service Act.<ref>{{USStatute|91|518|84|1327|1970|October|30|HR|17849}}</ref> Proponents of the bill, led by the [[National Association of Railroad Passengers]] (NARP), sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains.

The purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock; in exchange, the railroads received NRPC common stock.\n* Any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after May 1, 1971, except for those services chosen by the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] (DOT) as part of a \"basic system\" of service and paid for by NRPC using its federal funds.\n* Railroads that chose not to join the NRPC system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975 and thenceforth had to pursue the customary ICC approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service.\n\nOf the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970, only six declined to join Amtrak.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanders|2006|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> Nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived. The Nixon administration and many Washington insiders viewed the NRPC as a politically expedient way for the President and Congress to give passenger trains a \"last hurrah\" as demanded by the public.

While the NEC ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system, the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming. As a result, Amtrak's federal subsidy was increased dramatically. In subsequent years, other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to Amtrak.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn its first decade, Amtrak fell far short of financial independence, which continues today, but it did find modest success rebuilding trade. Outside factors discouraged competing transport, such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel, and strikes which disrupted airline operations.

Freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to Amtrak trains. Some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations, allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track.

In the area of pension funding, because of limitations originally imposed by Congress, most Amtrak workers were traditionally classified as \"railroad employees\" and contributions to the Railroad Retirement system have been made for those employees. However, because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work, some critics, such as the [[National Association of Railroad Passengers]], maintain that Amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as US$150 million/year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narprail.org/resources/fact-sheets/328-amtrak-myths-a-facts |title=Amtrak Myths & Facts: 4.

In fiscal 2004 and 2005, Congress appropriated about $1.2&nbsp;billion for Amtrak, $300&nbsp;million more than President [[George W. Bush]] had requested. However, the company's board requested $1.8&nbsp;billion through fiscal 2006, the majority of which (about $1.3&nbsp;billion) would be used to bring infrastructure, rolling stock, and motive power back to a state of good repair. In Congressional testimony, the DOT Inspector General confirmed that Amtrak would need at least $1.4&nbsp;billion to $1.5&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2006 and $2&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo. In 2006, Amtrak received just under $1.4&nbsp;billion, with the condition that Amtrak would reduce (but not eliminate) food and sleeper service losses. Thus, dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers. Only ''[[Auto Train]]'' and ''[[Empire Builder]]'' services continue regular made-on-board meal service.

The film revolves around how two families fight for ''\"Mahadevacha Pujacha Maan\"'', which literally translated in [[English language|English]] means \"the privilege to hold the [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] of [[Shiva]]\", (Mahadev is another name for Shiva) by taking part in the bullock cart race in their village.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDhananjay Rao ([[Sachin Pilgaonkar]]) is considered to be an ace in the bullock cart race held ever year in his village. He is also the family friend of Gayatri Devi (Neena Kulkarni), the wife of the village [[Zamindar]]. Dhananjay has won the race numerous times under the Zamindar's patron. But one day, Dhananjay suffers an accident during the race due to the fickle-minded antics of another fellow racer Pratap Rao (Vidyadhar Joshi), and the zamindar gets paralysed due to the shock he received from Dhananjay's defeat.\n\nAfter a few years, Dhananjay, who has quit the race after his defeat, is still the talking point of the village. Some people also say that this would be the last bullock cart race in the village for the privilege of the Puja of Shiva. Meanwhile, the power at the paralysed Zamindar's house went off due to a defective fuse in the fuse box, while two of his aides were in charge of repairing the fuse, the Zamindar, who was left off by his attendant along with his [[wheelchair]] near the staircase of the house in order to help the aide, attempts to kill himself by running his wheelchair over the stairs. But at the right moment, Dhananjay enters the scene, and saves him as the lights are turned on again.\n\nNext day, Gayatri Devi, who is now in charge of the house summons Dhananjay and thanks him for saving her husband's life. She requests him to take part in the race for privilege again, but Dhananjay refuses saying that it is not possible for him to do so as the memories of his defeat still haunts him and as such he has lost all interest in the race.\n\nIn the meantime, Dhananjay gets a threat call written on a note, saying that his brother Sanjay (Santosh Zuvekar) has been held captive by the feisty and cruel owner of a [[Casino]] as he was cheating in the game of cards and taking away all his money. Dhananjay reaches the site and pleads in front of the Manager of the Casino after creating a ruckus at the start, to let his brother Sanjay be freed, but the manager agrees to free him on one condition- Dhananjay has to submit a compensation of 10 lakh Rupees to him failing which his brother would be bruised and battered and shall be hanging from a net which he termed as a \"dire consequence\" of cheating with his money.\n\nHe rushes to a nearby Sugar cane mill where Gayatri Devi was monitoring it, and asks her for the money. Gayatri agrees to give him the money under one condition - he has to play the bullock cart race. Seeing no other option open, Dhananjay agrees to her conditions. Dhananjay finally frees Sanjay from the clutches of the Casino owner and coaxes him for his job at the casino.\n\nAfter bringing Sanjay to the village, Dhananjay leaves the spot, but he is soon confronted by his arch rival, Pratap Rao, who tries makes fun of him, gets humiliated when he comes to know that he shall be taking part in the race for privilege and gets challenged by Dhananjay to defeat him. Dhananjay returns to Gayatri's house at night for dinner, where he is introduced to her daughter Kanchana ([[Tejashree Pradhan Ketkar]]). On seeing her, Dhananjay's brother Sanjay tries to hide his face from her as he has previously encountered her near a petrol pump, and Kanchana mistook him as a pump attendant and also scolds him for flirting with her. But as the story progresses, Sanjay and Kanchana slowly begin to bond with each other, which ultimately culminates into love.\n\nMeanwhile, Pratap Rao tries to device methods of defeating Dhananjay in the race, Dhananjay, in the meantime too, begins his preparation by choosing the perfect pair of bullocks for the race, he begins training the bullocks for the race after getting them and also tries to take good care of them.\n\nA few days before the race, the two families bring their bullocks in front of the Temple of Shiva to seek blessings, but they are stopped in midway by a policeman who holds in front of them a brown envelope announcing that the race will not be held anymore as per orders received from the headquarters. Gayatri suspects this as foul play by Pratap Rao and hires another trustworthy policeman to know the truth. The policeman enters Pratap Rao's house to know his  entire plan. Pratap Rao in an [[inebriated]] state, discloses the entire plan in front of the policeman.\n\nNext day, Pratap Rao pays a visit to Gayatri's house, but is surprised when he sees the policeman who visited his house last night, standing near Gayatri's house. Realising that it was not possible for him to make Gayatri enter into a compromise, Pratap Rao visits Dhananjay's house in the evening and threatens him that he must lose the race.\n\nOn the day of the race, Gayatri tells Dhananjay Rao that he must win this 12-minute race in just 10 minutes, otherwise he will not be able to see his brother alive again. Dhananjay gets terrorised on hearing this and determined to save his brother from any injury, he begins to run his cart. In the race, he encounters many many obstacles created for him by the devil Pratap Rao, But he finally breaks all obstacles and wins the race in 10 minutes.\n\nDhananjay then rushes to the Sugar mill where Sanjay is said to have been kept captive. While searching the entire mill, he sees two fat human bodies falling from the first floor, followes by Sanjay jumping from the railing of the mill. He tells Dhananjay, that during the race, these men tried to shoot his bullocks, so he outnumbered them. At the same moment, Gayatri's daughter Kanchana arrives at the Scene with her mother and discloses their relation to Dhananjay.\n\nSuddenly, Pratap Rao, humiliated at his defeat enters the scene. He discovered that his wife has told Dhananjay everything about his plans and he takes out his gun to shoot her in front of all. But suddenly a bullock probably angry of Pratap's rude behaviour towards it, bangs him down on the floor. After a fight with Dhananjay, Partap is killed by the bullock whom he misbehaved. The story finally ends with Dhananjay, Gayatri Sanjay and Kanchana doing the puja in the Temple.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sachin Pilgaonkar]] as Dhananjay Rao\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Gayatri Devi\n* [[Vidyadhar Joshi]] as Prataprao\n* [[Santosh Juvekar]] as Sanjay\n* [[Tejashree Pradhan Ketkar]] as Kanchana\n* [[Neha Pendse]] (special appearance in an item number \"Sheelachya Aicha Gho\")<ref>{{cite news|title=Neha Pendse in a still from the Marathi movie 'Sharyat'.|url=http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/movies/regional-movies/Sharyat/articleshow/11105324.cms}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nSoundtrack of the film is scored by Chinar - Mahesh, was released worldwide on December 5, 2011 by Nanubhai of Video Palace.

The film revolves around how two families fight for ''\"Mahadevacha Pujacha Maan\"'', which literally translated in [[English language|English]] means \"the privilege to hold the [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] of [[Lord Shiva]]\", (Mahadev is another name for Shiva) by taking part in the bullock cart race in their village.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDhananjay Rao ([[Sachin Pilgaonkar]]) is considered to be an ace in the bullock cart race held ever year in his village. He is also the family friend of Gayatri Devi (Neena Kulkarni), the wife of the village [[Zamindar]]. Dhananjay has won the race numerous times under the Zamindar's patron. But one day, Dhananjay suffers an accident during the race due to the fickle-minded antics of another fellow racer Pratap Rao (Vidyadhar Joshi), and the zamindar gets paralysed due to the shock he received from Dhananjay's defeat.\n\nAfter a few years, Dhananjay, who has quit the race after his defeat, is still the talking point of the village. Some people also say that this would be the last bullock cart race in the village for the privilege of the Puja of Shiva. Meanwhile, the power at the paralysed Zamindar's house went off due to a defective fuse in the fuse box, while two of his aides were in charge of repairing the fuse, the Zamindar, who was left off by his attendant along with his [[wheelchair]] near the staircase of the house in order to help the aide, attempts to kill himself by running his wheelchair over the stairs. But at the right moment, Dhananjay enters the scene, and saves him as the lights are turned on again.\n\nNext day, Gayatri Devi, who is now in charge of the house summons Dhananjay and thanks him for saving her husband's life. She requests him to take part in the race for privilege again, but Dhananjay refuses saying that it is not possible for him to do so as the memories of his defeat still haunts him and as such he has lost all interest in the race.\n\nIn the meantime, Dhananjay gets a threat call written on a note, saying that his brother Sanjay (Santosh Zuvekar) has been held captive by the feisty and cruel owner of a [[Casino]] as he was cheating in the game of cards and taking away all his money. Dhananjay reaches the site and pleads in front of the Manager of the Casino after creating a ruckus at the start, to let his brother Sanjay be freed, but the manager agrees to free him on one condition- Dhananjay has to submit a compensation of 10 lakh Rupees to him failing which his brother would be bruised and battered and shall be hanging from a net which he termed as a \"dire consequence\" of cheating with his money.\n\nHe rushes to a nearby Sugar cane mill where Gayatri Devi was monitoring it, and asks her for the money. Gayatri agrees to give him the money under one condition - he has to play the bullock cart race. Seeing no other option open, Dhananjay agrees to her conditions. Dhananjay finally frees Sanjay from the clutches of the Casino owner and coaxes him for his job at the casino.\n\nAfter bringing Sanjay to the village, Dhananjay leaves the spot, but he is soon confronted by his arch rival, Pratap Rao, who tries makes fun of him, gets humiliated when he comes to know that he shall be taking part in the race for privilege and gets challenged by Dhananjay to defeat him. Dhananjay returns to Gayatri's house at night for dinner, where he is introduced to her daughter Kanchana ([[Tejashree Pradhan Ketkar]]). On seeing her, Dhananjay's brother Sanjay tries to hide his face from her as he has previously encountered her near a petrol pump, and Kanchana mistook him as a pump attendant and also scolds him for flirting with her. But as the story progresses, Sanjay and Kanchana slowly begin to bond with each other, which ultimately culminates into love.\n\nMeanwhile, Pratap Rao tries to device methods of defeating Dhananjay in the race, Dhananjay, in the meantime too, begins his preparation by choosing the perfect pair of bullocks for the race, he begins training the bullocks for the race after getting them and also tries to take good care of them.\n\nA few days before the race, the two families bring their bullocks in front of the Temple of Shiva to seek blessings, but they are stopped in midway by a policeman who holds in front of them a brown envelope announcing that the race will not be held anymore as per orders received from the headquarters. Gayatri suspects this as foul play by Pratap Rao and hires another trustworthy policeman to know the truth. The policeman enters Pratap Rao's house to know his  entire plan. Pratap Rao in an [[inebriated]] state, discloses the entire plan in front of the policeman.\n\nNext day, Pratap Rao pays a visit to Gayatri's house, but is surprised when he sees the policeman who visited his house last night, standing near Gayatri's house. Realising that it was not possible for him to make Gayatri enter into a compromise, Pratap Rao visits Dhananjay's house in the evening and threatens him that he must lose the race.\n\nOn the day of the race, Gayatri tells Dhananjay Rao that he must win this 12-minute race in just 10 minutes, otherwise he will not be able to see his brother alive again. Dhananjay gets terrorised on hearing this and determined to save his brother from any injury, he begins to run his cart. In the race, he encounters many many obstacles created for him by the devil Pratap Rao, But he finally breaks all obstacles and wins the race in 10 minutes.\n\nDhananjay then rushes to the Sugar mill where Sanjay is said to have been kept captive. While searching the entire mill, he sees two fat human bodies falling from the first floor, followes by Sanjay jumping from the railing of the mill. He tells Dhananjay, that during the race, these men tried to shoot his bullocks, so he outnumbered them. At the same moment, Gayatri's daughter Kanchana arrives at the Scene with her mother and discloses their relation to Dhananjay.\n\nSuddenly, Pratap Rao, humiliated at his defeat enters the scene. He discovered that his wife has told Dhananjay everything about his plans and he takes out his gun to shoot her in front of all. But suddenly a bullock probably angry of Pratap's rude behaviour towards it, bangs him down on the floor. After a fight with Dhananjay, Partap is killed by the bullock whom he misbehaved. The story finally ends with Dhananjay, Gayatri Sanjay and Kanchana doing the puja in the Temple.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sachin Pilgaonkar]] as Dhananjay Rao\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Gayatri Devi\n* [[Vidyadhar Joshi]] as Prataprao\n* [[Santosh Juvekar]] as Sanjay\n* [[Tejashree Pradhan Ketkar]] as Kanchana\n* [[Neha Pendse]] (special appearance in an item number \"Sheelachya Aicha Gho\")<ref>{{cite news|title=Neha Pendse in a still from the Marathi movie 'Sharyat'.|url=http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/movies/regional-movies/Sharyat/articleshow/11105324.cms}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nSoundtrack of the film is scored by Chinar - Mahesh, was released worldwide on December 5, 2011 by Nanubhai of Video Palace.

It is also the district administrative headquarters.\n\n==History==\n\n===From antiquity to the mutiny of 1857===\nAt nearby [[Bharhut]] are the remains of a 2nd-century BC Buddhist [[stupa]], first discovered in 1873 by the archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]]; most of the finds from this site were sent to the [[Indian Museum]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe ''[[Mahabharata]]'' associates this site with rulers of the Haihaya, Kalchuri or Chedi clans.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe chiefs of Rewash, descended from Baghel [[Rajput]]s (who were in turn descended from the [[Solanki (clan)|Solanki]]), ruled over [[Gujrat City|Gujrat]] from the tenth to the thirteenth century. Vyaghra Deo, brother of the ruler of Gujrat, is said to have made his way into northern India about the middle of the thirteenth century and obtained the fort of Marpha, 18 miles north-east of [[Kalinjar Fort|Kalinjar]]. of [[Bandhavgarh Fort|Bandhavgarh]] (now in the [[tehsil]] of the same name in [[Umaria district]]), which, until its conquest in 1562 by [[Akbar the Great]], was the Baghel capital. In 1298, general prince [[Ulugh Khan]], acting under order of his brother Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]], drove the last Baghel ruler of Gujrat out of his country. This is believed to have caused a considerable migration of the Baghels to Bandhavgarh.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFrom then until the 15th century, the Baghels of Bandhavgarh were engaged in extending their possessions and so they escaped the attention of the Delhi Sultans. In 1498\u201399, Sikandar Lodi failed in his attempt to take the fort of Bandhavgarh.\n\nThe Baghel King Ramchandra (1555\u201392) was a contemporary of [[padshah]] (emperor) [[Akbar the Great]]. [[Tansen]], the great musician, was in the court of Ramchandra and from there Akbar summoned him to his Mughal court. After the death of Birdhabra, Ramchandra's son [[Vikramaditya]] acceded to the [[Rajput]] throne of [[Bandhogarh State|Bandhogarh]] as a minor Raja, giving rise to civic disturbances. Akbar's generals intervened, capturing and dismantling the Bandhogarh fort in 1562. From then, the town of [[Rewa, Madhya Pradesh|Rewa]], along with the Sultanate of [[Malwa]] were became a part of the Great Mughal Empire.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] (1802), the British made overtures of alliance to the ruler of [[Rewari district|Rewa]], but the latter rejected them. In 1812, during the time of Raja Jaisingh (1809\u201335), a body of [[Pindaris]] raided Mirzapur from Rewa territory. As a result, Jaisingh was called upon to accede to a treaty, in which he acknowledged the protection of the British Government, and agreed to refer all disputes with neighboring chiefs to their arbitration and to allow British troops to march through, or be cantoned within, his territories.\n\nDuring the mutiny of 1857, Maharaja Raghuraj Singh helped the British in quelling the uprisings in the neighboring [[Mandla]] and [[Jabalpur]] district, and in [[Nagod]] which is now a part of Satna district. For his part the king was rewarded by restoration of the [[Sohagpur]] ([[Shahdol]]) and [[Amarkantak]] [[parganas]], which had been seized by the [[Maratha]]s in the beginning of the century.\nRewa was entitled as a Maharaja\"His Highness\" and salute of 17 guns.\n\n===Princely states ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== Baroundha state====\nBaroundha state belongs to \"Raghuvanshi\" \"clan\"of [[Rajput]]s the most prestigious clan amongst Rajputs according to Hindu literature(Ramayan).

In 1478 [[Raja Bhoj]] obtained [[Unchehara|Unchahara]], which he made the chief town. It remained so until 1720, when the capital was moved to Nagod by Raja Chainsingh. Later, the [[Parihar]]s lost all their territories to the Baghels and [[Bundela]]s except the limited territory that they held before 1947.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFollowing the treaty of [[Bassein Fort|Bassein]] in 1820, [[Nagod]] was held to be a tributary to Panna and was included in the [[Deed#Sanad|sanad]] granted to that state in 1807. In 1809, however, a separate sanad was granted to Lal Sheshraj Singh confirming him in his possessions.\n\nFor his loyalty during the 1857 mutiny, Chief Raghvendra Singh was rewarded by the British who granted him eleven villages, which had formerly belonged to the confiscated state of Bijeraghogarh.\n\n[[Nagod]] [[tribal chief|chief]]s had the title of Raja and received a 9 [[gun salute]].\n\n====Maihar state====\n{{See also|Maihar}}\n[[Maihar State]] was a [[princely state]] in India during the British Raj.

From 1788 to 1790 Maihar State was occupied by Banda. The state became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century, and was administered as part of Bundelkhand Agency in the Central India Agency. In 1871 the eastern states of Bundelkhand Agency, including Maihar, were separated to form the new Bagelkhand Agency in Central India. In 1933 Maihar, along with ten other states in western Bagelkhand, were transferred back to the Bundelkhand Agency.\n\nThe state suffered severely from famine in 1896\u20131897.

Its capital was at Sohawal, a small town \u20142,108 inhabitants in 1901\u2014 located in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe state was divided in two sections, separated by territory belonging to [[Kothi State]] and, on its northern side, it formed a small enclave within neighbouring [[Panna State]].\n\nSohawal State was founded in the mid sixteenth century by a ruler named Fateh Singh. It had originally been much larger, but lost significant territory within the first centuries of its existence.\n\nSohawal became a British [[protectorate]], initially subordinate to Panna State, but a separate sanad was granted to Rais Aman Singh in 1809. During the 1830 - 1833 interregnum, Sohawal came under direct British administration.[2] The last ruler of Sohawal signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n* [[Chaube Jagirs]] (five feudatory estates).\n\n===Modern history===\n\nThe Satna District is part of the region of [[Bagelkhand]], a large part of which was ruled by the state of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]].

Vyaghra Deo, brother of the ruler of Gujrat, is said to have made his way into northern India about the middle of the thirteenth century and obtained the fort of Marpha, 18 miles north-east of [[Kalinjar Fort|Kalinjar]]. of [[Bandhavgarh Fort|Bandhavgarh]] (now in the [[tehsil]] of the same name in [[Umaria district]]), which, until its conquest in 1562 by [[Akbar the Great]], was the Baghel capital. In 1298, general prince [[Ulugh Khan]], acting under order of his brother Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]], drove the last Baghel ruler of Gujrat out of his country. This is believed to have caused a considerable migration of the Baghels to Bandhavgarh.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFrom then until the 15th century, the Baghels of Bandhavgarh were engaged in extending their possessions and so they escaped the attention of the Delhi Sultans. In 1498\u201399, Sikandar Lodi failed in his attempt to take the fort of Bandhavgarh.\n\nThe Baghel King Ramchandra (1555\u201392) was a contemporary of [[padshah]] (emperor) [[Akbar the Great]].

After the death of Birdhabra, Ramchandra's son [[Vikramaditya]] acceded to the [[Rajput]] throne of [[Bandhogarh State|Bandhogarh]] as a minor Raja, giving rise to civic disturbances. Akbar's generals intervened, capturing and dismantling the Bandhogarh fort in 1562. From then, the town of [[Rewa, Madhya Pradesh|Rewa]], along with the Sultanate of [[Malwa]] were became a part of the Great Mughal Empire.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] (1802), the British made overtures of alliance to the ruler of [[Rewari district|Rewa]], but the latter rejected them. In 1812, during the time of Raja Jaisingh (1809\u201335), a body of [[Pindaris]] raided Mirzapur from Rewa territory. As a result, Jaisingh was called upon to accede to a treaty, in which he acknowledged the protection of the British Government, and agreed to refer all disputes with neighboring chiefs to their arbitration and to allow British troops to march through, or be cantoned within, his territories.\n\nDuring the mutiny of 1857, Maharaja Raghuraj Singh helped the British in quelling the uprisings in the neighboring [[Mandla]] and [[Jabalpur]] district, and in [[Nagod]] which is now a part of Satna district.

The state's territory divided neighbouring Sohawal State in two parts.<ref name=\"IGI1\">[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V23_076.gif Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 70.]</ref> Kothi State was founded at an uncertain date by a [[Rajput]] ruler who expelled the former Bharr ruler of the area.\n\nTowards the beginning of the nineteenth century, and in much the same manner as neighboring Sohawal, Kothi became a British protectorate initially subordinate to Panna State. However, a separate sanad was granted to Rais Lal Duniyapati Singh in 1810. The last ruler of Kothi signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n====Sohawal state====\n[[Sohawal State]] was a princely state of the Bagelkhand Agency of the British Raj. It was a relatively small [[sanad (deed)|sanad]] state of about 552 km2 with a population of 32,216 inhabitants in 1901. Its capital was at Sohawal, a small town \u20142,108 inhabitants in 1901\u2014 located in modern Satna district of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe state was divided in two sections, separated by territory belonging to [[Kothi State]] and, on its northern side, it formed a small enclave within neighbouring [[Panna State]].\n\nSohawal State was founded in the mid sixteenth century by a ruler named Fateh Singh. It had originally been much larger, but lost significant territory within the first centuries of its existence.\n\nSohawal became a British [[protectorate]], initially subordinate to Panna State, but a separate sanad was granted to Rais Aman Singh in 1809. During the 1830 - 1833 interregnum, Sohawal came under direct British administration.[2] The last ruler of Sohawal signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950.\n\n* [[Chaube Jagirs]] (five feudatory estates).\n\n===Modern history===\n\nThe Satna District is part of the region of [[Bagelkhand]], a large part of which was ruled by the state of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]].

Another explanation put forward is the introduction of the [[500 yen coin]] in 1982. The Japanese mint at the time stated that a higher value coin was needed for use in vending machines.<ref name=\"Mark\"/> In any case mintage figures recovered towards the very end of Emperor Sh\u014dwa's reign.

Another explanation put forward is the introduction of the [[500 yen coin]] in 1982. The Japanese mint at the time stated that a higher value coin was needed for use in vending machines.<ref name=\"Mark\"/> In any case mintage figures recovered towards the very end of Emperor Sh\u014dwa's reign.
