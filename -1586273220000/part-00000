In ancient times, Greeks and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called ''[[magi|magosh]]'' in Persian, came to be known as ''magoi'' in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as ''mageia'', and then ''magika'' \u2014 which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. To the general public, successful acts of illusion could be perceived as if it were similar to a feat of magic supposed to have been able to be performed by the ancient magoi. The performance of tricks of illusion, or magical illusion, and the apparent workings and effects of such acts have often been referred to as \"magic\" and particularly as magic tricks.\n\nDuring the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin]], who had a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. [[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]] in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.<ref name=\"History of Magic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|title=History of Magic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=This French site, Magiczoom, has now closed its doors|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125440/http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|archive-date=2006-05-15|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref> As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.\n\nPerformances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout [[history]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Art of Deception, or The Magical Affinity Between Conjuring and Art | author=Romano, Chuck | journal=The Linking Ring |date=January 1995 | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=67\u201370}}</ref> The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the [[Trojan Horse]] would also have been used for [[entertainment]], or at least for cheating in [[gambling|money games]]. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and [[cult]]s from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Magic tricks===\n{{See also|List of magic tricks}}\n{{redirect|Magic trick|the 1953 film by Orson Welles|Magic Trick (film)}}\nOpinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then \"restore\" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.\n\n[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the \"Decollation of John Baptist\" [[Guillotine (magic trick)|decapitation illusion]] may be performed]]\nOne of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, ''Natural and Unnatural Magic'', which describes and explains old-time tricks.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin|url=https://archive.org/details/unmaskingrobert00houdgoog|authorlink=Harry Houdini|first=Harry|last=Houdini|page=19|year=1908}}</ref> In 1584, Englishman [[Reginald Scot]] published ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their \"magic tricks\" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were [[sleight-of-hand]] manipulations with rope, paper and coins. At the time, fear and belief in [[witchcraft]] was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/05/10-facts-about-magicians/ |title=10 Facts About Magicians \u2013 Andi Gladwin&nbsp;\u2013 Close-Up Magician |publisher=Illusionist.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=Philip C.|title=King James I and the burning of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft: The invention of a tradition|journal=Notes and Queries|year=2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=209\u2013213|doi=10.1093/notesj/gjp002}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including ''The Art of Conjuring'' (1614) and ''The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling'' (c. 1675).\n\n[[File:Fawkesshow.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for [[Isaac Fawkes]]' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George]]\nUntil the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of [[sword swallowing]], [[juggling]] and [[fire breathing]]. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, [[Isaac Fawkes]], who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s\u2014he even claimed to have performed for [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:\n{{quote|He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table.

He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]].\n\n[[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]]. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as ''The Great Wizard of the North''. His success came from [[advertising]] his shows and captivating his audience with expert [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in [[Glasgow]] in 1845.\n\n[[File:John Nevil Maskelyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Nevil Maskelyne]], a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.]]\nTowards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.<ref name=\"History of Magic\"/> The [[United Kingdom|British]] performer [[John Nevil Maskelyne|J N Maskelyne]] and his partner Cooke were established at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly]] in 1873 by their manager [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]], and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often [[Orientalism|Oriental]]) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.\nMaskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today\u2014one of his best-known being [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]].<ref name=\"Dawes_2\">{{Cite journal|title = The Great Illusionists|first=Edwin|last=Dawes|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc.|year=1979|page=161}}{{ISBN?}}</ref>\n\nThe model for the look of a 'typical' magician\u2014a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat\u2014was [[Alexander Herrmann]] (1844\u20131896), also known as Herrmann the Great. Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the \"first-family of magic\".\n\nThe escapologist and magician [[Harry Houdini]] took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as [[escapology]]. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show-business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a [[Houdini Museum]] dedicated to him in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].\n\n[[The Magic Circle (organization)|The Magic Circle]] was formed in London in 1905 to promote and advance the art of stage magic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/about-the-club|title=About The Magic Circle|author=Jack Delvin}}</ref>\n\nAs a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included [[Okito]], [[David Devant]], [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]], [[Harry Blackstone Jr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Theodore Annemann]], [[Richard Valentine Pitchford|Cardini]], [[Joseph Dunninger]], [[Dai Vernon]], [[Fred Culpitt]], [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]], [[Siegfried & Roy]], and [[Doug Henning]]. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[James Randi]], [[Penn and Teller]], [[David Blaine]], [[Criss Angel]], [[Hans Klok]], [[Derren Brown]] [[Steve Knight (magician)|Steve Knight]] and [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]]. Well-known women magicians include [[Dell O'Dell]] and [[Dorothy Dietrich]]. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production [[visual effects]].\n\nMany of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, \"it's all done with smoke and mirrors\", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous [[Pepper's Ghost]], a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.\n\n==Types of magic performance==\nMagic is often described according to various specialties or genres.\n[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[mentalist]] on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]\n[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amateur]] magician performing \"children's magic\" for a birthday party audience]]\n*[[Stage illusions]] are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Chung Ling Soo]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[Siegfried & Roy]], and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]]\n*[[Parlor magic]]  is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by T.A. Waters, \"The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance.\" Also, many magicians consider the term \"parlor\" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be \"platform\", \"club\" or \"cabaret\". Examples of such magicians include [[Jeff McBride]], [[David Abbott (magician)|David Abbott]], [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]], [[Black Herman]], and [[Fred Kaps]]. \n*[[Close-up magic]] (also known as micromagic or table magic) is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as [[playing card|cards]] (see [[Card manipulation]]), [[coin]]s (see [[Coin magic]]), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called \"table magic\", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. [[Ricky Jay]], [[Mahdi Moudini]], and [[Lee Asher]], following in the traditions of [[Dai Vernon]], [[Slydini]], and [[Max Malini]], are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.\n*[[Escapology]] is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Harry Houdini]] is a well-known example of an ''escape artist'' or ''escapologist''.\n*[[Pickpocket]] magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[David Avadon]], [[Bob Arno]], and [[Apollo Robbins]].\n*[[Mentalism]] creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include [[Alexander (magician)|Alexander]], [[The Zancigs]], [[Axel Hellstrom]], [[Dunninger]], [[Kreskin]], [[Derren Brown]], [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]], [[Guy Bavli]], [[Banachek]], and [[Alain Nu]].\n*[[Theatrical s\u00e9ances]] simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.\n*[[Children's magic]] is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.\n*Online magic tricks were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |title=online magic tricks magical illusions |publisher=Real Magic |accessdate=2012-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417205948/http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |archive-date=2011-04-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> became a [[viral phenomenon]] that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that [[Snopes]] dedicated a page to debunking the trick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/psychic.asp |title=Online Psychic Trick |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n*[[Mathemagician|Mathemagic]] is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and [[mathematics]]. It is commonly used by [[children's magic]]ians and [[mentalists]].\n*Corporate magic or trade show magic uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock<ref name=\"Herz1991\">Bill Herz with Paul Harris. ''Secrets of the Astonishing Executive'' (New York: Avon Books, 1991). {{ISBN?}}</ref> and [[Guy Bavli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |title=Guy Bavli \u2013 Biography |publisher=All About Magicians.com |accessdate=2011-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103014752/http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |archive-date=2011-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714045408/http://www.masterofthemind.com/press/Guy%20Bavli%20-%20dream-team%20IBC%20Award-PR2000.pdf Master of the Mind \u2013 Guy Bavoi]</ref>\n*[[Gospel magic]] uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by [[St. John Bosco]] to interest children in 19th-century [[Turin]], [[Italy]] to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.\n*[[Street magic]] is a form of street performing or [[busking]] that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed '[[theatre in the round|in the round]]' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include [[Jeff Sheridan]] and [[Gazzo (magician)|Gazzo]]. Since the first [[David Blaine]] TV special ''Street Magic'' aired in 1997, the term \"street magic\" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include [[David Blaine]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].\n*[[Bizarre magic]] uses [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[horror (genre)|horror]], [[fantasy]], and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] has generally been credited as the \"godfather of bizarre magic\". Others such as [[Tony Andruzzi]] have contributed significantly to its development.\n*Shock magic is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as \"geek magic\", it takes its roots from circus [[sideshow]]s, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, [[needle-through-arm]], string through neck and pen-through-tongue.,\n*Comedy magic is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include [[The Amazing Johnathan]], [[Mac King]], and [[Penn & Teller]].\n*Quick change magic is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos & Victoria Petrosyan.\n*Camera magic (or \"video magic\") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as [[Derren Brown]]'s lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of [[Criss Angel]]'s illusions.\n*Classical Magic is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally.\n\n==Categories of effects==\nMagicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider \"penetrations\" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as [[Guy Hollingworth]]<ref>Hollingworth, Guy. \"Waiting For Inspiration.\" Genii Magazine. January 2008 \u2013 December 2008.</ref> and [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]]<ref>Stone, Tom. \"Lodestones.\" Genii Magazine. February 2009</ref> have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as [[Dariel Fitzkee]], [[Harlan Tarbell]], S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.\n\n*Production: The magician produces something from nothing\u2014a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a [[Dove pan|dove from a pan]], or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage\u2014all of these effects are ''productions''.\n*Vanish: The magician makes something disappear\u2014a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the [[Vanishing the Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]]. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.\n*Transformation: The magician transforms something from one state into another\u2014a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a [[tiger]], an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. [[File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv|thumb|Transformation: Change of color]]\n*Restoration: The magician destroys an object\u2014a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a [[sawing a woman in half|woman is cut in half]], a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces\u2014then restores it to its original state.\n*Transposition: A transposition involves two or more objects. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. \n*Teleportation: The magician causes something to move from one place to another\u2014a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production.  When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.\n*Escape:  The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., [[handcuffs]] or a [[straitjacket]]) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.\n*[[Levitation (illusion)|Levitation]]: The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)\u2014a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician levitates his own body in midair. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including [[Asrah levitation]], [[Balducci levitation]], [[invisible thread]], and [[King levitation]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Finch |first1=Jon |title=Types of Magic Tricks |url=https://www.finchmagician.com/magic/types-of-magic-tricks |website=Magician Jon Finch |publisher=Jon Finch |accessdate=3 February 2020 |ref=Types of Magic Tricks}}</ref> The [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying illusion]] has often been performed by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]. [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone]] floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.\n*Penetration: The magician makes a solid object pass through another\u2014a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as \"solid-through-solid\".\n*Prediction: The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event\u2014a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate\u2014under seemingly impossible circumstances.\n\nMany magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in \"[[cups and balls]]\" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.\n\nThe methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.\n\n==Learning magic==\n{{see also|List of magic publications}}\n[[File:King Magic.jpg|thumb|A stage magician using a [[top hat]] as a prop]]\n\nDedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity, as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = The Theory and Art of Magic\n  |author1=Hass, Larry  |author2=Burger, Eugene\n   |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = The Linking Ring\n  | publisher = The International Brotherhood of Magicians\n  |date=November 2000}}</ref>\nThe teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|title=The Magician's Oath: A Conversation with Pat Hammond on Magic, Science, and the Wind {{!}} Drachen Foundation|website=www.drachen.org|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201213337/http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|archive-date=2016-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.\n\nFrom the 1584 publication of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.\n\nPersons interested in learning to perform magic can join [[magic club]]s. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other\u2014sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.\n\nThe world's largest magic organization is the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]; it publishes a monthly journal, ''[[The Linking Ring]]''. The oldest organization is the [[Society of American Magicians]], which publishes the monthly magazine ''[[M-U-M]]'' and of which [[Houdini]] was a member and president for several years. In [[London]], [[England]], there is [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS\u2014The British Society of Mystery Entertainers<ref>{{cite web|author=S.J.Drury [web-aviso.com] |url=http://www.psycrets.org.uk |title=psycrets.org.uk |publisher=psycrets.org.uk |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>\u2014caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers.

Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. [[Stage illusions]] use large-scale props and even large animals. [[Platform magic]] is performed for a medium to large audience. [[Close-up magic]] is performed with the audience close to the magician. [[Escapology]] involves escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Pickpocket]] magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. \n[[Mentalism]] creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being [[Penn & Teller]]. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, [[Confidence trick|con men]] and grifters who use deception for cheating at [[card game]]s.\n\n==Misuse of magic==\n\nSome modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term \"magician\" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of \"illusionist\" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] makes these points by billing himself as an \"honest liar\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|title=Deception's his tool (but he's no politician)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/10/31/Deception-s-his-tool-but-he-s-no-politician/stories/200810310191|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2008}}</ref> Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist [[Joseph Dunninger]], who states \"For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |title=Memorable-Quotes.com |publisher=Memorable-Quotes.com |accessdate=2011-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207030534/http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |archive-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the illusionist [[Uri Geller]] made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent\u2014and continues to bend\u2014spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.\n\nLess fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.\n\nFraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism religious movement]] as well as public interest in [[s\u00e9ance]]s, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] effects, which they attributed to the actions of [[ghosts]] or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist [[Harry Houdini]] devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.<ref>Harry Houdini.

Cheating at [[card game]]s is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, ''The Expert at the Card Table'' by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as \"Find the Lady\" or \"[[Three-card Monte]]\" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the [[shell game]], in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.<ref>Andrew Blankenstein. \"8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation,\" [[Los Angeles Times]], December 10, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Researching magic==\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of magic, research can be a challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic/getstarted|title=Research Guides: Magic & magicians: Get started|first=Dominique|last=Dunstan|website=guides.slv.vic.gov.au}}</ref> Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana.

In ancient times, Greeks and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called ''[[magi|magosh]]'' in Persian, came to be known as ''magoi'' in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as ''mageia'', and then ''magika'' \u2014 which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. To the general public, successful acts of illusion could be perceived as if it were similar to a feat of magic supposed to have been able to be performed by the ancient magoi. The performance of tricks of illusion, or magical illusion, and the apparent workings and effects of such acts have often been referred to as \"magic\" and particularly as magic tricks.\n\nDuring the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin]], who had a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. [[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]] in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.<ref name=\"History of Magic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|title=History of Magic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=This French site, Magiczoom, has now closed its doors|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125440/http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|archive-date=2006-05-15|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref> As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.\n\nPerformances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout [[history]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Art of Deception, or The Magical Affinity Between Conjuring and Art | author=Romano, Chuck | journal=The Linking Ring |date=January 1995 | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=67\u201370}}</ref> The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the [[Trojan Horse]] would also have been used for [[entertainment]], or at least for cheating in [[gambling|money games]].

However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Magic tricks===\n{{See also|List of magic tricks}}\n{{redirect|Magic trick|the 1953 film by Orson Welles|Magic Trick (film)}}\nOpinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then \"restore\" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.\n\n[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the \"Decollation of John Baptist\" [[Guillotine (magic trick)|decapitation illusion]] may be performed]]\nOne of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, ''Natural and Unnatural Magic'', which describes and explains old-time tricks.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin|url=https://archive.org/details/unmaskingrobert00houdgoog|authorlink=Harry Houdini|first=Harry|last=Houdini|page=19|year=1908}}</ref> In 1584, Englishman [[Reginald Scot]] published ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their \"magic tricks\" were in reality accomplished.

At the time, fear and belief in [[witchcraft]] was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/05/10-facts-about-magicians/ |title=10 Facts About Magicians \u2013 Andi Gladwin&nbsp;\u2013 Close-Up Magician |publisher=Illusionist.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=Philip C.|title=King James I and the burning of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft: The invention of a tradition|journal=Notes and Queries|year=2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=209\u2013213|doi=10.1093/notesj/gjp002}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including ''The Art of Conjuring'' (1614) and ''The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling'' (c. 1675).\n\n[[File:Fawkesshow.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for [[Isaac Fawkes]]' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George]]\nUntil the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of [[sword swallowing]], [[juggling]] and [[fire breathing]].

He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]].\n\n[[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]]. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as ''The Great Wizard of the North''. His success came from [[advertising]] his shows and captivating his audience with expert [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in [[Glasgow]] in 1845.\n\n[[File:John Nevil Maskelyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Nevil Maskelyne]], a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.]]\nTowards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.<ref name=\"History of Magic\"/> The [[United Kingdom|British]] performer [[John Nevil Maskelyne|J N Maskelyne]] and his partner Cooke were established at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly]] in 1873 by their manager [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]], and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often [[Orientalism|Oriental]]) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.\nMaskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today\u2014one of his best-known being [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]].<ref name=\"Dawes_2\">{{Cite journal|title = The Great Illusionists|first=Edwin|last=Dawes|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc.|year=1979|page=161}}{{ISBN?}}</ref>\n\nThe model for the look of a 'typical' magician\u2014a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat\u2014was [[Alexander Herrmann]] (1844\u20131896), also known as Herrmann the Great. Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the \"first-family of magic\".\n\nThe escapologist and magician [[Harry Houdini]] took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as [[escapology]]. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show-business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a [[Houdini Museum]] dedicated to him in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].\n\n[[The Magic Circle (organization)|The Magic Circle]] was formed in London in 1905 to promote and advance the art of stage magic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/about-the-club|title=About The Magic Circle|author=Jack Delvin}}</ref>\n\nAs a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included [[Okito]], [[David Devant]], [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]], [[Harry Blackstone Jr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Theodore Annemann]], [[Richard Valentine Pitchford|Cardini]], [[Joseph Dunninger]], [[Dai Vernon]], [[Fred Culpitt]], [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]], [[Siegfried & Roy]], and [[Doug Henning]]. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[James Randi]], [[Penn and Teller]], [[David Blaine]], [[Criss Angel]], [[Hans Klok]], [[Derren Brown]] [[Steve Knight (magician)|Steve Knight]] and [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]]. Well-known women magicians include [[Dell O'Dell]] and [[Dorothy Dietrich]]. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production [[visual effects]].\n\nMany of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, \"it's all done with smoke and mirrors\", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous [[Pepper's Ghost]], a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.\n\n==Types of magic performance==\nMagic is often described according to various specialties or genres.\n[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[mentalist]] on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]\n[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amateur]] magician performing \"children's magic\" for a birthday party audience]]\n*[[Stage illusions]] are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Chung Ling Soo]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[Siegfried & Roy]], and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]]\n*[[Parlor magic]]  is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by T.A. Waters, \"The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance.\" Also, many magicians consider the term \"parlor\" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be \"platform\", \"club\" or \"cabaret\". Examples of such magicians include [[Jeff McBride]], [[David Abbott (magician)|David Abbott]], [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]], [[Black Herman]], and [[Fred Kaps]]. \n*[[Close-up magic]] (also known as micromagic or table magic) is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as [[playing card|cards]] (see [[Card manipulation]]), [[coin]]s (see [[Coin magic]]), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called \"table magic\", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. [[Ricky Jay]], [[Mahdi Moudini]], and [[Lee Asher]], following in the traditions of [[Dai Vernon]], [[Slydini]], and [[Max Malini]], are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.\n*[[Escapology]] is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Harry Houdini]] is a well-known example of an ''escape artist'' or ''escapologist''.\n*[[Pickpocket]] magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[David Avadon]], [[Bob Arno]], and [[Apollo Robbins]].\n*[[Mentalism]] creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include [[Alexander (magician)|Alexander]], [[The Zancigs]], [[Axel Hellstrom]], [[Dunninger]], [[Kreskin]], [[Derren Brown]], [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]], [[Guy Bavli]], [[Banachek]], and [[Alain Nu]].\n*[[Theatrical s\u00e9ances]] simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.\n*[[Children's magic]] is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.\n*Online magic tricks were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |title=online magic tricks magical illusions |publisher=Real Magic |accessdate=2012-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417205948/http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |archive-date=2011-04-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> became a [[viral phenomenon]] that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that [[Snopes]] dedicated a page to debunking the trick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/psychic.asp |title=Online Psychic Trick |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n*[[Mathemagician|Mathemagic]] is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and [[mathematics]]. It is commonly used by [[children's magic]]ians and [[mentalists]].\n*Corporate magic or trade show magic uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock<ref name=\"Herz1991\">Bill Herz with Paul Harris. ''Secrets of the Astonishing Executive'' (New York: Avon Books, 1991). {{ISBN?}}</ref> and [[Guy Bavli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |title=Guy Bavli \u2013 Biography |publisher=All About Magicians.com |accessdate=2011-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103014752/http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |archive-date=2011-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714045408/http://www.masterofthemind.com/press/Guy%20Bavli%20-%20dream-team%20IBC%20Award-PR2000.pdf Master of the Mind \u2013 Guy Bavoi]</ref>\n*[[Gospel magic]] uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by [[St. John Bosco]] to interest children in 19th-century [[Turin]], [[Italy]] to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.\n*[[Street magic]] is a form of street performing or [[busking]] that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed '[[theatre in the round|in the round]]' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include [[Jeff Sheridan]] and [[Gazzo (magician)|Gazzo]]. Since the first [[David Blaine]] TV special ''Street Magic'' aired in 1997, the term \"street magic\" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include [[David Blaine]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].\n*[[Bizarre magic]] uses [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[horror (genre)|horror]], [[fantasy]], and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] has generally been credited as the \"godfather of bizarre magic\". Others such as [[Tony Andruzzi]] have contributed significantly to its development.\n*Shock magic is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as \"geek magic\", it takes its roots from circus [[sideshow]]s, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, [[needle-through-arm]], string through neck and pen-through-tongue.,\n*Comedy magic is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include [[The Amazing Johnathan]], [[Mac King]], and [[Penn & Teller]].\n*Quick change magic is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos & Victoria Petrosyan.\n*Camera magic (or \"video magic\") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as [[Derren Brown]]'s lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of [[Criss Angel]]'s illusions.\n*Classical Magic is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally.\n\n==Categories of effects==\nMagicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider \"penetrations\" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as [[Guy Hollingworth]]<ref>Hollingworth, Guy. \"Waiting For Inspiration.\" Genii Magazine. January 2008 \u2013 December 2008.</ref> and [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]]<ref>Stone, Tom. \"Lodestones.\" Genii Magazine. February 2009</ref> have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as [[Dariel Fitzkee]], [[Harlan Tarbell]], S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.\n\n*Production: The magician produces something from nothing\u2014a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a [[Dove pan|dove from a pan]], or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage\u2014all of these effects are ''productions''.\n*Vanish: The magician makes something disappear\u2014a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the [[Vanishing the Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]]. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.\n*Transformation: The magician transforms something from one state into another\u2014a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a [[tiger]], an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. [[File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv|thumb|Transformation: Change of color]]\n*Restoration: The magician destroys an object\u2014a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a [[sawing a woman in half|woman is cut in half]], a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces\u2014then restores it to its original state.\n*Transposition: A transposition involves two or more objects. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. \n*Teleportation: The magician causes something to move from one place to another\u2014a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production.  When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.\n*Escape:  The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., [[handcuffs]] or a [[straitjacket]]) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.\n*[[Levitation (illusion)|Levitation]]: The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)\u2014a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician levitates his own body in midair. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including [[Asrah levitation]], [[Balducci levitation]], [[invisible thread]], and [[King levitation]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Finch |first1=Jon |title=Types of Magic Tricks |url=https://www.finchmagician.com/magic/types-of-magic-tricks |website=Magician Jon Finch |publisher=Jon Finch |accessdate=3 February 2020 |ref=Types of Magic Tricks}}</ref> The [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying illusion]] has often been performed by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]. [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone]] floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.\n*Penetration: The magician makes a solid object pass through another\u2014a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as \"solid-through-solid\".\n*Prediction: The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event\u2014a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate\u2014under seemingly impossible circumstances.\n\nMany magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in \"[[cups and balls]]\" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.\n\nThe methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.\n\n==Learning magic==\n{{see also|List of magic publications}}\n[[File:King Magic.jpg|thumb|A stage magician using a [[top hat]] as a prop]]\n\nDedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity, as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = The Theory and Art of Magic\n  |author1=Hass, Larry  |author2=Burger, Eugene\n   |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = The Linking Ring\n  | publisher = The International Brotherhood of Magicians\n  |date=November 2000}}</ref>\nThe teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|title=The Magician's Oath: A Conversation with Pat Hammond on Magic, Science, and the Wind {{!}} Drachen Foundation|website=www.drachen.org|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201213337/http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|archive-date=2016-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.\n\nFrom the 1584 publication of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.\n\nPersons interested in learning to perform magic can join [[magic club]]s. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other\u2014sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.\n\nThe world's largest magic organization is the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]; it publishes a monthly journal, ''[[The Linking Ring]]''. The oldest organization is the [[Society of American Magicians]], which publishes the monthly magazine ''[[M-U-M]]'' and of which [[Houdini]] was a member and president for several years. In [[London]], [[England]], there is [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS\u2014The British Society of Mystery Entertainers<ref>{{cite web|author=S.J.Drury [web-aviso.com] |url=http://www.psycrets.org.uk |title=psycrets.org.uk |publisher=psycrets.org.uk |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>\u2014caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers.

Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. [[Stage illusions]] use large-scale props and even large animals. [[Platform magic]] is performed for a medium to large audience. [[Close-up magic]] is performed with the audience close to the magician. [[Escapology]] involves escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Pickpocket]] magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. \n[[Mentalism]] creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being [[Penn & Teller]]. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, [[Confidence trick|con men]] and grifters who use deception for cheating at [[card game]]s.\n\n==Misuse of magic==\n\nSome modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term \"magician\" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of \"illusionist\" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] makes these points by billing himself as an \"honest liar\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|title=Deception's his tool (but he's no politician)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/10/31/Deception-s-his-tool-but-he-s-no-politician/stories/200810310191|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2008}}</ref> Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist [[Joseph Dunninger]], who states \"For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |title=Memorable-Quotes.com |publisher=Memorable-Quotes.com |accessdate=2011-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207030534/http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |archive-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the illusionist [[Uri Geller]] made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent\u2014and continues to bend\u2014spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.\n\nLess fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.\n\nFraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism religious movement]] as well as public interest in [[s\u00e9ance]]s, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] effects, which they attributed to the actions of [[ghosts]] or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist [[Harry Houdini]] devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.<ref>Harry Houdini. A Magician Among the Spirits (New York: Harper and Bros., 1924)</ref>  Magician [[James Randi]], magic duo [[Penn and Teller|Penn & Teller]], and the mentalist [[Derren Brown]] have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims.<ref>{{cite web|last=Randi |first=James |date=February 9, 2007 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i6 |title=More Geller Woo-Woo |work=SWIFT Newsletter |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml |archivedate=July 10, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ One-Million-Dollar Challenge] from MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group</ref>\n\nFraudulent [[faith healers]] have also been shown to employ [[sleight of hand]] to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet \"tumors\" from patients' abdomens.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= The Skeptic's Dictionary |url= http://skepdic.com/psurgery.html |title= Psychic 'surgery' |author= Robert T. Carroll |date= 2009-02-23 |accessdate= 2010-08-19 }}</ref>\n\n[[Confidence trick|Con men]] and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at [[card game]]s is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, ''The Expert at the Card Table'' by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as \"Find the Lady\" or \"[[Three-card Monte]]\" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the [[shell game]], in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.<ref>Andrew Blankenstein. \"8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation,\" [[Los Angeles Times]], December 10, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Researching magic==\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of magic, research can be a challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic/getstarted|title=Research Guides: Magic & magicians: Get started|first=Dominique|last=Dunstan|website=guides.slv.vic.gov.au}}</ref> Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magicol.magicana.com/ |title=Magic Collectors |publisher=Magicana |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the [[Conjuring Arts Research Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conjuringarts.org/ |title=conjuringarts.org |publisher=conjuringarts.org |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.\n\nPerformance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=83646&sid=620815#1981235 |title=Magicians \u2013 Magic & magicians \u2013 Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> of the time.\n\nMany books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author<ref>Bart King, The Pocket Guide to Magic, Gibbs Smith, 2009</ref> has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.\n\nSeveral notable public research collections on magic are the ''WG Alma Conjuring Collection''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic |title=Get started \u2013 Magic & magicians \u2013 Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> at the State Library of Victoria; the ''R.

Alison James.  The book is best known for its message about selfishness and sharing and for the distinctive shiny foil [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s of the Rainbow Fish. [[DHX Media|Decode Entertainment]] turned the story into an [[animated television series]] of the same name, which had aired on the [[HBO#List of channels|HBO Family]] [[television channel]] in the United States and [[Teletoon]] in Canada from 1999 until 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is about a fish with shiny, multi-colored scales named the Rainbow Fish. He has blue, green, and purple scales, and among them, he has shiny silver scales he is always fond of. One day a small fish asks him if he could have one. The Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The other fish (including the little blue fish) are very upset about his behavior and do not want to play with him anymore.\n\nFeeling upset, his only remaining friend, the starfish, tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. The Rainbow Fish finds the octopus and asks what he should do. When he goes to the cave, he sees the octopus. And when he meets the octopus, she says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she gives the Rainbow Fish her advice. Her advice is that he must share his scales with the other fish. Then he might be no longer the most beautiful fish after that, but will discover how to be happy. However, he says he can't share his scales. But the octopus disappeared as a cloud of ink. \n\nWhen he encounters the little blue fish a second time, the Rainbow Fish gives him one of his precious scales and sees the joy of the little fish. With that one shiny scale gone, he immediately feels much better. Very soon the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by other fish requesting scales and he (as the octopus asked of him) shares each of his shiny scales with the others. Soon, all of the fish have a shiny silver scale just like Rainbow Fish. \n\nIn the end, despite having only one shiny scale left (as he had shared them all), he becomes very happy.\n\n==Theme==\nA ''Publishers Weekly'' reviewer called the book a \"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Children's Book Review: The Rainbow Fish |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55858-009-1|publisher=Publishers Weekly}}</ref>\n\n==Book series==\n* ''Rainbow Fish to the Rescue'': About the acceptance and integration of foreigners.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale'': About arguments and how to settle them.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Sea Monster's Cave'': About irrational and rational fears.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Finds his Way'': With the help of his new friends, Rainbow Fish finds his way back home.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea'': About modesty and happiness.\n\n==Short film==\nOn March 25 1997, an animated adaptation of the book was released on VHS and DVD. The home video releases also contain the film ''Dazzle the Dinosaur'' which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \"Giving Makes You Special\".\n\n==Television series==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Rainbow Fish\n| image                = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = \n| creator              = [[Marcus Pfister]]\n| based_on             = \n| writer               = {{Plainlist|\n* Dean Stefan\n* [[Rowby Goren]]\n* Richard Stanley\n* Alan Swayze\n* [[Ian James Corlett]]\n* Brooks Wachtel\n* Shelley Zellman\n* Patti Carr\n* Lara Runnels\n* Francis Moss\n* S.

Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \"The School of Fish\". There is a [[shipwreck]] called \"Shipwreck Park\" in the series that resembles the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic]]. It was produced by [[Decode Entertainment]] and [[EM.TV]] for [[Sony Wonder]].\n\n===Characters===\n<!-- This is an American television program and therefore should be in American English, not British English. -->\n{{fanpov|section|date=July 2014}}\n\n'''Rainbow Fish''': The proud, vibrant fish that lives with his parents and sister.

Alison James.  The book is best known for its message about selfishness and sharing and for the distinctive shiny foil [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s of the Rainbow Fish. [[DHX Media|Decode Entertainment]] turned the story into an [[animated television series]] of the same name, which had aired on the [[HBO#List of channels|HBO Family]] [[television channel]] in the United States and [[Teletoon]] in Canada from 1999 until 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is about a fish with shiny, multi-colored scales named the Rainbow Fish. He has blue, green, and purple scales, and among them, he has shiny silver scales he is always fond of. One day a small fish asks him if he could have one. The Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The other fish (including the little blue fish) are very upset about his behavior and do not want to play with him anymore.\n\nFeeling upset, his only remaining friend, the starfish, tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. The Rainbow Fish finds the octopus and asks what he should do. When he goes to the cave, he sees the octopus. And when he meets the octopus, she says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she gives the Rainbow Fish her advice. Her advice is that he must share his scales with the other fish. Then he might be no longer the most beautiful fish after that, but will discover how to be happy. However, he says he can't share his scales. But the octopus disappeared as a cloud of ink. \n\nWhen he encounters the little blue fish a second time, the Rainbow Fish gives him one of his precious scales and sees the joy of the little fish. With that one shiny scale gone, he immediately feels much better. Very soon the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by other fish requesting scales and he (as the octopus asked of him) shares each of his shiny scales with the others. Soon, all of the fish have a shiny silver scale just like Rainbow Fish. \n\nIn the end, despite having only one shiny scale left (as he had shared them all), he becomes very happy.\n\n==Theme==\nA ''Publishers Weekly'' reviewer called the book a \"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Children's Book Review: The Rainbow Fish |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55858-009-1|publisher=Publishers Weekly}}</ref>\n\n==Book series==\n* ''Rainbow Fish to the Rescue'': About the acceptance and integration of foreigners.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale'': About arguments and how to settle them.\n* ''Rainbow Fish and the Sea Monster's Cave'': About irrational and rational fears.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Finds his Way'': With the help of his new friends, Rainbow Fish finds his way back home.\n* ''Rainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea'': About modesty and happiness.\n\n==Short film==\nOn March 25 1997, an animated adaptation of the book was released on VHS and DVD. The home video releases also contain the film ''Dazzle the Dinosaur'' which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \"Giving Makes You Special\".\n\n==Television series==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Rainbow Fish\n| image                = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = \n| creator              = [[Marcus Pfister]]\n| based_on             = \n| writer               = {{Plainlist|\n* Dean Stefan\n* [[Rowby Goren]]\n* Richard Stanley\n* Alan Swayze\n* [[Ian James Corlett]]\n* Brooks Wachtel\n* Shelley Zellman\n* Patti Carr\n* Lara Runnels\n* Francis Moss\n* S.

Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \"The School of Fish\". There is a [[shipwreck]] called \"Shipwreck Park\" in the series that resembles the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic]]. It was produced by [[Decode Entertainment]] and [[EM.TV]] for [[Sony Wonder]].\n\n===Characters===\n<!-- This is an American television program and therefore should be in American English, not British English. -->\n{{fanpov|section|date=July 2014}}\n\n'''Rainbow Fish''': The proud, vibrant fish that lives with his parents and sister.

In ''Dog City: The Movie'', Ace Yu inherits a bar-restaurant called the Dog House following the death of his Uncle Harry and is harassed for [[Protection racket|protection money]] by crime syndicate boss Bugsy Them (who was responsible for the death of Uncle Harry, who, as it turns out, was actually Ace's father). Refusing to pay or fight him, Bugsy kidnaps Ace's love interest, Colleen. There are car chases and shoot-em-ups and rubber duckies involved in the action. In the end, Ace defeats Bugsy and gets the girl.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jim Henson's Dog City: The Movie  |work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/42887/jim-hensons-dog-city-the-movie/|accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Characters===\n* '''Ace Yu''' (performed by [[Kevin Clash]]) - A [[German Shepherd]] adopted by Chinese [[Pekingese]] parents.

His puppet is later used to play Bruno in the TV series.\n** '''Miss Belle''' (performed by [[Camille Bonora]]) - A [[poodle]] that is the key associate and the wife of Bugsy Them.\n** '''Mad Dog''' (performed by [[Steve Whitmire]]) - Bugsy Them's dimwitted [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] henchman.

The [[Muppet]] portions of the show focused on the interactions between Ace Hart and his [[animator]] Eliot Shag (who, like Ace, is a [[German Shepherd]]). Eliot would illustrate the stories while Ace would go traverse through it, occasionally breaking the fourth wall to speak with Eliot about the various troubles with the story. In one episode, Eliot even enters Dog City himself to join Ace in solving a mystery.\n\nA recurring gag was that many of the characters in the cartoon were seemingly based on the residents of Eliot's apartment building. The [[bulldog]] crime-boss Bugsy Vile was inspired by the building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno. Ace's love interest Rosie was based on Eliot's deep feelings for his neighbor Colleen, and so on. The Muppet characters were unaware of this. In the first episode, Bruno asks Eliot how a loser like him could have created a great character like Bugsy. Eliot replies, \"Sometimes it just stares me right in the face.\"\n\nLater series included segments from other shows Eliot worked on, including skits featuring the main ''Dog City'' characters and a [[superhero]] series starring the [[Batman]] parody ''Watchdog''.\n\n==Characters==\n===Animated===\n* '''Ace Hart''' (voiced by [[Ron White (actor)|Ron White]]) - A [[German Shepherd]] who is a private-eye [[detective]].\n* '''Rosie O'Gravy''' (voiced by [[Elizabeth Hanna]]) - A beautiful [[Rough Collie]] who is the chief of detectives and Ace's love interest.\n* '''Eddie''' (voiced by [[Stuart Stone]]) - An [[English Springer Spaniel]] news-pup who often tags along on Ace Hart's cases.\n* '''Bugsy Vile''' (voiced by [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]]) - A [[bulldog]] who is a [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]].

The [[Muppet]] portions of the show focused on the interactions between Ace Hart and his [[animator]] Eliot Shag (who, like Ace, is a [[German Shepherd]]). Eliot would illustrate the stories while Ace would go traverse through it, occasionally breaking the fourth wall to speak with Eliot about the various troubles with the story. In one episode, Eliot even enters Dog City himself to join Ace in solving a mystery.\n\nA recurring gag was that many of the characters in the cartoon were seemingly based on the residents of Eliot's apartment building. The [[bulldog]] crime-boss Bugsy Vile was inspired by the building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno. Ace's love interest Rosie was based on Eliot's deep feelings for his neighbor Colleen, and so on. The Muppet characters were unaware of this. In the first episode, Bruno asks Eliot how a loser like him could have created a great character like Bugsy. Eliot replies, \"Sometimes it just stares me right in the face.\"\n\nLater series included segments from other shows Eliot worked on, including skits featuring the main ''Dog City'' characters and a [[superhero]] series starring the [[Batman]] parody ''Watchdog''.\n\n==Characters==\n===Animated===\n* '''Ace Hart''' (voiced by [[Ron White (actor)|Ron White]]) - A [[German Shepherd]] who is a private-eye [[detective]].\n* '''Rosie O'Gravy''' (voiced by [[Elizabeth Hanna]]) - A beautiful [[Rough Collie]] who is the chief of detectives and Ace's love interest.\n* '''Eddie''' (voiced by [[Stuart Stone]]) - An [[English Springer Spaniel]] news-pup who often tags along on Ace Hart's cases.\n* '''Bugsy Vile''' (voiced by [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]]) - A [[bulldog]] who is a [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]].
