Early 20th century writers often engaged in [[yellow journalism]] focused on [[Sensationalism|sensationalistic]] aspects of the region's culture, such as [[moonshining]] and [[Appalachia#Feuds|clan feuding]], and often portrayed the region's inhabitants as uneducated and prone to impulsive acts of violence.

Introduction to ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. xix\u2013xxv.</ref>\n\nWhile endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with [[poverty]]. In the early 20th century, large-scale [[logging]] and [[coal mining]] firms brought wage-paying jobs and modern amenities to Appalachia, but by the 1960s the region had failed to capitalize on any long-term benefits<ref>{{cite web |last=Sokol |first=Anna |title=Economic Redevelopment in Appalachia: The Appalachian Regional Commission |url=http://www.umich.edu/~econdev/arc/ |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> from these two industries. Beginning in the 1930s, the federal government sought to alleviate poverty in the Appalachian region with a series of [[New Deal]] initiatives, such as the construction of [[dam]]s to provide cheap electricity and the implementation of better farming practices. On March 9, 1965, the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/newsevents/workshops/2011/participants/papers/12-Ziliak.pdf |title=The Appalachian Regional Development Act and Economic Change |last=Ziliak |first=James P. |date=September 16, 2010 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> was created to further alleviate poverty in the region, mainly by diversifying the region's economy and helping to provide better health care and educational opportunities to the region's inhabitants. By 1990, Appalachia had largely joined the economic mainstream, but still lagged behind the rest of the nation in most economic indicators.<ref name=abramson1/>\n\n==Defining the Appalachian region==\n{{See also|Social and economic stratification in Appalachia|List of Appalachian Regional Commission counties}}\n[[File:William-goodell-frost-1914.jpg|thumb|200px|left|William G.

The most commonly used modern definition of Appalachia is the one initially defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965 and expanded over subsequent decades.<ref name=abramson1 /> The region defined by the Commission currently includes 420 counties and eight [[Independent city (Virginia)|independent cities]] in 13 states, including all of [[West Virginia]], 14 counties in [[New York (state)|New York]], 52 in [[Pennsylvania]], 32 in [[Ohio]], 3 in [[Maryland]], 54 in [[Kentucky]], 25 counties and 8 [[Administrative divisions of Virginia#Independent cities|cities]] in [[Virginia]],<ref>In Virginia, all municipalities incorporated as \"cities\" are legally separate from counties.</ref> 29 in [[North Carolina]], 52 in [[Tennessee]], 6 in [[South Carolina]], 37 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 37 in [[Alabama]], and 24 in [[Mississippi]].<ref name=arc1 /> When the Commission was established, counties were added based on economic need, however, rather than any cultural parameters.<ref name=abramson1 />\n\nThe first major attempt to map Appalachia as a distinctive cultural region came in the 1890s with the efforts of [[Berea College]] president William Goodell Frost, whose \"Appalachian America\" included 194 counties in 8 states.<ref name=williams>John Alexander Williams, ''Appalachia: A History'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002)</ref>{{rp|11\u201314}} In 1921, John C. Campbell published ''The Southern Highlander and His Homeland'' in which he modified Frost's map to include 254 counties in 9 states. A landmark survey of the region in the following decade by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] defined the region as consisting of 206 counties in 6 states. In 1984, Karl Raitz and Richard Ulack expanded the ARC's definition to include 445 counties in 13 states, although they removed all counties in Mississippi and added two in [[New Jersey]]. Historian John Alexander Williams, in his 2002 book ''Appalachia: A History'', distinguished between a \"core\" Appalachian region consisting of 164 counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, and a greater region defined by the ARC.<ref name=abramson1 /> In the ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (2006), [[Appalachian State University]] historian [[Howard Dorgan]] suggested the term \"Old Appalachia\" for the region's cultural boundaries, noting an academic tendency to ignore the southwestern and northeastern extremes of the ARC's pragmatic definition.<ref>Abramson, Rudy, and Jean Haskell, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1287\u201388.</ref> [[Sean Trende]], senior elections analyst at ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', defines \"Greater Appalachia\" in his 2012 book ''The Lost Majority'' as including both the [[Appalachian Mountains]] region ([[Western Virginia|western Virginia]] and [[Western North Carolina|North Carolina]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region in western South Carolina, West Virginia, [[Appalachian Ohio|southern Ohio]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], [[East Tennessee]], [[North Georgia|northern Georgia]], [[North Alabama|Alabama]], and [[North Mississippi|Mississippi]]) and the [[Upland South]] ([[Southern Indiana|southern Indiana]] and [[Southern Illinois|Illinois]], the [[Bluegrass region|Bluegrass]], [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Plateau]], [[Western Coal Field]], and [[Jackson Purchase]] regions in central and western Kentucky, [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[West Tennessee]], [[Missouri]], the [[Ozarks]] in Arkansas, [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]] and [[Southwestern Oklahoma]], [[North Texas|North]] and [[East Texas]], and the [[Texas Hill Country]]) following [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Protestant]] migrations to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trende|first=Sean|author-link=Sean Trende|title=The Lost Majority: Why the Future of Government Is Up for Grabs\u2013and Who Will Take It|year=2012|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=978-0230116467|pages=xxii\u2013xxviii|url=https://archive.org/details/lostmajoritywhyf0000tren}}</ref>\n\n===Toponymy and pronunciation===\n[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail of Gutierrez' 1562 map showing the first known cartographic appearance of a variant of the name \"Appalachia\"]]\n\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of [[Florida]] in 1528, the members of the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], including [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]], whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachin'' ({{IPA-all|apa\u02c8lat\u0283en}}). The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name.

The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (cartographer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]]'s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.<ref>Walls, David (1977), \"On the Naming of Appalachia\", in ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56\u201376.</ref> Le Moyne was also the first European to apply \"Apalachin\" specifically to a mountain range as opposed to a village, native tribe, or a southeastern region of North America.<ref>Blaustein, Richard (2003), ''The Thistle and the Brier: Historical Links and Cultural Parallels Between Scotland and Appalachia'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the \"[[Allegheny Mountains]]\", \"Alleghenies\", and even \"Alleghania\". In the early 19th century, [[Washington Irving]] proposed renaming the United States either \"Appalachia\" or \"Alleghania\".<ref>[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967).

The earliest discovered site is the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], which some scientists claim is pre-[[Clovis culture]]. Several other [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (8000\u20131000 BC) archaeological sites have been identified in the region, such as the [[St. Albans, West Virginia|St. Albans]] site in West Virginia and the [[Icehouse Bottom]] site in Tennessee. In the 16th century, the de Soto and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expeditions explored the mountains of South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and encountered complex agrarian societies consisting of [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking]] inhabitants. De Soto indicated that much of the region west of the mountains was part of the domain of [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], a [[paramount chief]]dom centered around a village complex in northern Georgia.<ref>Hudson, Charles. ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566\u20131568'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 17.</ref> By the time English explorers arrived in Appalachia in the late 17th century, the central part of the region was controlled by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes (namely the [[Shawnee]]) and the southern part of the region was controlled by the [[Cherokee]]. The [[New France|French]] based in modern-day [[Quebec]] also made inroads into the northern areas of the region in modern-day New York state and Pennsylvania. By the mid 18th century the French had outposts such as [[Fort Duquesne]] and [[Fort Le Boeuf]] controlling the access points of the [[Allegheny River]] valley and upper [[Ohio valley]] after exploration by [[Celeron de Bienville]].\n\n[[File: George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|'' Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the [[Cumberland Gap]]'' ([[George Caleb Bingham]], oil on canvas, 1851\u201352)]]\n\nEuropean migration into Appalachia began in the 18th century. As lands in eastern Pennsylvania, the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] and [[the Carolinas]] filled up, immigrants began pushing further and further westward into the Appalachian Mountains. A relatively large proportion of the early [[backcountry]] immigrants were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]\u2014later known as \"[[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]]\"\u2014 who were seeking cheaper land and freedom from [[Quakers|Quaker]] leaders, many of whom considered the Scotch-Irish \"savages\". Others included [[Germans]] from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region and English settlers from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] country. Between 1730 and 1763, immigrants trickled into [[western Pennsylvania]], the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area of Virginia, and [[western Maryland]]. [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker's]] discovery of [[Cumberland Gap]] in 1750 and the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 lured settlers deeper into the mountains, namely to upper [[east Tennessee]], northwestern North Carolina, [[upstate South Carolina]], and central Kentucky. Between 1790 and 1840, a series of treaties with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes opened up lands in [[north Georgia (U.S. state)|north Georgia]], [[North Alabama]], the [[Tennessee Valley]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] regions, and the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] along what is now the Tennessee-North Carolina border.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|30\u201344}} The last of these treaties culminated in the removal of the bulk of the Cherokee population (as well as [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]] and others) from the region via the [[Trail of Tears]] from 1831 until 1838.\n\n===The Appalachian frontier===\n[[File:Earnest-fort-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Earnest Fort-house in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. Built around 1782 during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]], it is located just south of [[Chuckey, Tennessee|Chuckey]] on the banks of the [[Nolichucky River]].]]\n\nAppalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a [[coonskin cap]] and [[buckskins|buckskin clothing]] and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped [[powder horn]]. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than [[Daniel Boone]] (1734\u20131820), a [[long hunter]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from \"civilization\" by high mountain ridges and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century.<ref name=Caudill>Caudill, Harry. ''Night Comes to the Cumberlands''</ref>{{rp|7\u201313, 19}}\n\nAs early as the 18th century, Appalachia (then known simply as the \"backcountry\") began to distinguish itself from its wealthier lowland and coastal neighbors to the east. Frontiersmen often bickered with lowland and [[tidewater region|tidewater]] \"elites\" over taxes, sometimes to the point of armed revolts such as the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] (1767\u20131771) in North Carolina.<ref name=drake>Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)</ref>{{rp|59\u201369}} In 1778, at the height of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], backwoodsmen from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and what is now Kentucky took part in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s [[Illinois campaign]]. Two years later, a group of Appalachian frontiersmen known as the [[Overmountain Men]] routed British forces at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] after rejecting a call by the British to disarm.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|64\u201368}} After the war, residents throughout the Appalachian backcountry\u2014especially the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] region in western Pennsylvania, and [[antebellum South|antebellum]] northwestern Virginia (now the north-central part of West Virginia) \u2014 refused to pay a tax placed on whiskey by the new American government, leading to what became known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref name=williams/>{{rp|118\u201319}} The resulting tighter Federal controls in the Monongahela valley resulted in many whiskey/bourbon makers migrating via the Ohio River to Kentucky and Tennessee where the industry could flourish.\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn the early 19th century, the rift between the [[yeoman]] farmers of Appalachia and their wealthier lowland counterparts continued to grow, especially as the latter dominated most state legislatures. People in Appalachia began to feel slighted over what they considered unfair taxation methods and lack of state funding for improvements (especially for roads). In the northern half of the region, the lowland \"elites\" consisted largely of industrial and business interests, whereas in the parts of the region south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], the lowland elites consisted of large-scale land-owning [[plantations in the American South|planters]].<ref name=drake/>{{rp|59\u201369}} The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], formed in the 1830s, drew widespread support from the disaffected Appalachians.\n\nTensions between the mountain counties and state governments sometimes reached the point of mountain counties threatening to break off and form separate states. In 1832, bickering between western Virginia and eastern Virginia over the state's constitution led to calls on both sides for the state's separation into two states.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|141}} In 1841, Tennessee state senator (and later U.S. president) [[Andrew Johnson]] introduced legislation in the [[Tennessee Senate]] calling for the creation of a separate state in East Tennessee. The proposed state would have been known as \"Frankland\" and would have invited like-minded mountain counties in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama to join it.<ref>Lacy, Eric.

In southern Appalachia, abolitionists still constituted a radical minority, although several smaller opposition parties (most of which were both pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and pro-slavery) were formed to oppose the planter-dominated [[Southern Democrats]].

After Virginia voted to secede, several mountain counties in northwestern Virginia rejected the ordinance and with the help of the [[Union Army]] established a separate state, admitted to the Union as West Virginia in 1863. However, half the counties included in the new state, comprising two-thirds of its territory, were secessionist and pro-Confederate.<ref>Curry, Richard O.

While there were two major theaters of operation in the region\u2014namely the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia (and present-day West Virginia) and the [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] area along the Tennessee-Georgia border\u2014much of the violence was caused by [[bushwhacker]]s and [[guerrilla war]]. The northernmost battles of the entire war were fought in Appalachia with the [[Battle of Buffington Island]] and the [[Battle of Salineville]] resulting from [[Morgan's Raid]]. Large numbers of livestock were killed (grazing was an important part of Appalachia's economy), and numerous farms were destroyed, pillaged, or neglected.<ref name=mckinney1 /> The actions of both Union and Confederate armies left many inhabitants in the region resentful of government authority and suspicious of outsiders for decades after the war.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=Caudill/>{{rp|39\u201345}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\n\n====Economic boom====\n[[File:West-virginia-mine-entrance1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Entrance to mine shaft in West Virginia, photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] in 1908]]\n\nAfter the war, northern parts of Appalachia experienced an economic boom, while economies in the southern parts of the region stagnated, especially as Southern Democrats regained control of their respective state legislatures at the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=mckinney1 /> [[Pittsburgh]] as well as [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] grew into major industrial centers, especially regarding iron and steel production. By 1900, the Chattanooga area and north Georgia and northern Alabama had experienced similar changes due to manufacturing booms in [[Atlanta]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] at the edge of the Appalachian region. Railroad construction between the 1880s and early 20th century gave the greater nation access to the vast coalfields in central Appalachia, making the [[Appalachian Land Ownership Survey|economy]] in that part of the region practically synonymous with coal mining. As the nationwide demand for lumber skyrocketed, lumber firms turned to the virgin forests of southern Appalachia, using sawmill and logging railroad innovations to reach remote timber stands. The [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] area of Tennessee and Virginia and the [[Kanawha Valley]] of West Virginia became major [[petrochemical]] production centers.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|131\u2013141}}\n\n====Stereotypes====\n{{main|Appalachian stereotypes}}\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the development of various regional stereotypes. Attempts by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to enforce the whiskey tax in the late 1870s led to an explosion in violence between Appalachian \"[[moonshine]]rs\" and federal \"revenuers\" that lasted through the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] period in the 1920s.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u2013193}} The breakdown of authority and law enforcement during the Civil War may have contributed to an increase in clan feuding, which by the 1880s was reported to be a problem across most of Kentucky's Cumberland region as well as [[Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County]] in Tennessee, [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]] in Virginia, and [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo]] and [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan]] counties in West Virginia.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u201393}} Regional writers from this period such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]] and [[Horace Kephart]] liked to focus on such sensational aspects of mountain culture, leading readers outside the region to believe they were more widespread than in reality. In an 1899 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Berea College]] president William G. Frost attempted to redefine the inhabitants of Appalachia as \"noble mountaineers\"\u2014relics of the nation's pioneer period whose isolation had left them unaffected by modern times.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}}\n\nToday, residents of Appalachia are viewed by many Americans as uneducated and unrefined, resulting in culture-based stereotyping and [[discrimination]] in many areas, including employment and housing. Such discrimination has prompted some to seek redress under prevailing federal and state [[civil rights]] laws.<ref>E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. \"Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition\", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).</ref>\n\n====Feuds====\nAppalachia, and especially Kentucky, became nationally known for its violent [[feud]]s, especially in the remote mountain districts. They pitted the men in extended clans against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with [[ambush]]es, [[gunfight]]s, and pre-arranged [[shootout]]s. The infamous [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|Hatfield-McCoy Feud]] of the 19th century was the best known of these family feuds. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes.<ref>, Otterbein, Keith F. \"Five Feuds: An Analysis of Homicides in Eastern Kentucky in the Late Nineteenth Century\", ''American Anthropologist'', June 2000, Vol. 102 Issue 2, pp 231\u201343, provides a theoretical analysis.</ref> Journalists often wrote about the violence, using stereotypes that \"city folks\" had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the natural products of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps even [[inbreeding]]. In reality, the leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who were fighting for local political power.<ref>Billings, Dwight B., and [[Kathleen M. Blee]], \"' Where the Sun Set Crimson and the Moon Rose Red': Writing Appalachia and the Kentucky Mountain Feuds\", ''Southern Cultures'', Summer 1996, Vol. 2 Issue 3/4, pp 329\u2013352</ref>\n\n===Modern Appalachia===\nLogging firms' rapid devastation of the forests of the Appalachians sparked a movement among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] to preserve what remained and allow the land to \"heal\". In 1911, Congress passed the [[Weeks Act]], giving the federal government authority to create [[United States National Forest|national forests]] east of the Mississippi River and control timber harvesting. Regional writers and business interests led a movement to create national parks in the eastern United States similar to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] in the west, culminating in the creation of the [[the Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in Tennessee and North Carolina, [[Shenandoah National Park]] in Virginia, [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]] in Kentucky,  Virginia, and Tennessee, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (connecting the two) in the 1930s.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|200\u2013210}} During the same period, New England forester [[Benton MacKaye]] led the movement to build the {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Appalachian Trail]], stretching from Georgia to [[Maine]].\n\nBy the 1950s, poor farming techniques and the loss of jobs to [[mechanization]] in the mining industry had left much of central and southern Appalachia poverty-stricken. The lack of jobs also led to widespread difficulties with [[emigration|outmigration]]. Beginning in the 1930s, federal agencies such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] began investing in the Appalachian region.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|310\u201312}} [[Sociologist]]s such as James Brown and Cratis Williams and authors such as [[Harry Caudill]] and [[Michael Harrington]] brought attention to the region's plight in the 1960s, prompting Congress to create the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965.

Religion in Appalachia is characterized by a sense of independence and distrust of religious [[hierarchical organization|hierarchies]], both rooted in the [[evangelical]] tendencies of the region's pioneers, many of whom had been influenced by the \"[[New Light]]\" movement in England. Many of the denominations brought from Europe underwent modifications or functioning during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (especially the [[holiness movement]]) in the early 19th century. A number of 18th and 19th-century religious traditions are still practiced in parts of Appalachia, including natural water (or \"creek\") [[baptism]], rhythmically chanted preaching, congregational shouting, [[snake handling]], and [[foot washing]]. While most church-goers in Appalachia attend fairly well-organized churches affiliated with regional or national bodies, small unaffiliated congregations are not uncommon in rural mountain areas.<ref>Dorgan, Howard, Introduction to the \"Religion\" section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1281\u201389.</ref><ref name=grammich />\n\n[[Protestantism]] is the most dominant denomination in Appalachia, although there is a significant [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic]] presence in the northern half of the region and in urban areas, like Pittsburgh and Scranton.

The Northern Midland dialect is spoken in the northern parts of the region, while [[Pittsburgh English]] (more commonly known as \"Pittsburghese\") is strongly influenced by Appalachian dialect.<ref name=\"Johnstone PBS\">{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Barbara |title=Steel Town Speak |journal=[[Language magazine]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/pittsburghese/ |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref> The Southern Appalachian dialect is considered part of the [[Southern American English|Southern American dialect]],<ref>Labov, William, Sharon Ash & Charles Boberg, ''Atlas of North American English'', Mouton de Gruyter, 2005</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/MapsS/Map1S.html|title=South Regional Map|website=www.ling.upenn.edu}}</ref> although the two are distinguished by the [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]] nature of the Appalachian dialect. Early 20th century writers believed the Appalachian dialect to be a surviving relic of Old World Scottish or Elizabethan dialects. Recent research suggests, however, that while the dialect has a stronger Scottish influence than other American dialects, most of its distinguishing characteristics have developed in the United States.<ref>Montgomery, Montgomery, \"Language \u2013 Introduction\", ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 999\u20131004.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nFor much of the region's history, education in Appalachia has lagged behind the rest of the nation due in part to struggles with funding from respective state governments and an agrarian-oriented population that often failed to see a practical need for formal education. Early education in the region evolved from teaching Christian morality and learning to read the [[Bible]] into small, [[one-room school]]houses that convened in months when children were not needed to help with farm work. After the Civil War, mandatory education laws and state assistance helped larger communities begin to establish graded schools and high schools. During the same period, many of the region's institutions of higher education were established or greatly expanded.<ref name=deyoung>DeYoung, Alan, Introduction to Education section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1517\u201321.</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, service organizations such as [[Pi Beta Phi]] and various religious organizations established [[settlement school]]s and mission schools in the region's more rural areas.<ref>Alvic, Philis, \"Settlement, Mission, and Sponsored Schools\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1551.</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, national trends began to have more of an effect on education in Appalachia, sometimes clashing with the region's traditional values. The [[Scopes Trial]]\u2014the nation's most publicized debate over the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]]\u2014took place in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], in southern Appalachia in 1925. In spite of consolidation and centralization, schools in Appalachia struggled to keep up with federal and state demands into the 21st century. Since 2001, a number of the region's public schools were threatened with loss of funding due to difficulties fulfilling the demands of [[No Child Left Behind]].<ref name=deyoung />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main article|Appalachian music}}\nAppalachian music is one of the best-known manifestations of Appalachian culture. Traditional Appalachian music is derived primarily from the English and Scottish [[ballad]] tradition and Irish and Scottish [[fiddle]] music. African-American [[blues]] musicians played a significant role in developing the instrumental aspects of Appalachian music, most notably with the introduction of the five-stringed [[banjo]]\u2014one of the region's iconic symbols\u2014in the late 18th century. Another instrument known in Appalachian culture was the [[Appalachian dulcimer]] which, in a practical way, is a guitar-shaped instrument laid on its side with a flat bottom and the strings plucked in a manner to make alternating notes.\n\nIn the years following World War I, British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] brought attention to Southern Appalachia when he noted that its inhabitants still sang hundreds of English and Scottish ballads that had been passed down to them from their ancestors. Commercial recordings of Appalachian musicians in the 1920s would have a significant impact on the development of [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[old-time music]]. Appalachian music saw a resurgence in popularity during the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s, when musicologists such as [[Mike Seeger]], [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], and [[Ralph Rinzler]] traveled to remote parts of the region in search of musicians unaffected by modern music. Today, dozens of annual music festivals held throughout the region preserve the Appalachian music tradition.<ref>Olson, Ted, \"Music \u2013 Introduction\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109\u201320.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Hazel-creek-proctor-nc1.jpg|210px|thumb|Former site of [[Proctor, North Carolina]], setting of [[Horace Kephart|Kephart's]] book, ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]]]\nEarly Appalachian literature typically centered on the observations of people from outside the region, such as [[Henry Timberlake]]'s ''Memoirs'' (1765) and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1784), although there are notable exceptions, including [[Davy Crockett]]'s ''A Narrative of the Life of Davy Crockett'' (1834). Travelers' accounts published in 19th-century magazines gave rise to Appalachian [[American literary regionalism|local color]], which reached its height with [[George Washington Harris]]'s Sut Lovingood character of the 1860s and native novelists such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]]. Works such as [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s ''Life in the Iron Mills'' (1861), [[Emma Bell Miles]]' ''The Spirit of the Mountains'' (1905), Catherine Marshall's ''[[Christy (novel)|Christy]]'' (1912), [[Horace Kephart]]'s ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]'' (1913) marked a shift in the region's literature from local color to realism. The transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society and its effects on Appalachia are captured in works such as [[Olive Tilford Dargan]]'s ''Call Home to the Heart'' (1932), [[Agnes Sligh Turnbull]]'s ''[[The Rolling Years]]'' (1936), [[James Still]]'s ''The River of Earth'' (1940), [[Harriette Simpson Arnow]]'s ''The Dollmaker'' (1954), and [[Harry Caudill]]'s ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'' (1962). In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of authors like [[Breece D'J Pancake]], [[Dorothy Allison]], and [[Lisa Alther]] brought greater literary diversity to the region.<ref name=toney>Edwards, Grace Toney, \"Literature \u2013 Introduction\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1035\u201339.</ref>\n\nAlong with the above-mentioned, some of Appalachia's best known writers include [[James Agee]] (''[[A Death in the Family]]''), [[Anne W. Armstrong]] (''This Day and Time''), [[Wendell Berry]] (''Hannah Coulter'', ''The Unforeseen Wilderness: An Essay on Kentucky's Red River Gorge'', ''Selected Poems of Wendell Berry''), [[Jesse Stuart]] (''Taps for Private Tussie'', ''The Thread That Runs So True''), [[Denise Giardina]] (''The Unquiet Earth'', ''Storming Heaven''), [[Lee Smith (fiction author)|Lee Smith]] (''Fair and Tender Ladies'', ''On Agate Hill''), [[Silas House]] (''Clay's Quilt'', ''A Parchment of Leaves''), [[Wilma Dykeman]] (''The Far Family'', ''The Tall Woman''), [[Keith Maillard]] (''Alex Driving South'', ''Light in the Company of Women'', ''Hazard Zones'', ''Gloria'', ''Running'', ''Morgantown'', ''Lyndon Johnson and the Majorettes'', ''Looking Good'')  [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]] (''Bucolics'', ''A Companion for Owls''), Anne Shelby (''Appalachian Studies'', ''We Keep a Store''), [[George Ella Lyon]] (''Borrowed Children'', ''Don't You Remember?''), [[Pamela Duncan (novelist)|Pamela Duncan]] (''Moon Women'', ''The Big Beautiful''), [[David Joy (author)|David Joy]] (\"Where All Light Tends to Go\", \"The Weight of This World\"), [[Chris Offutt]] (''No Heroes'', ''The Good Brother''), [[Charles Frazier]] (''[[Cold Mountain (novel)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''Thirteen Moons''), [[Sharyn McCrumb]] (''The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter''), [[Robert Morgan (poet)|Robert Morgan]] (''Gap Creek''), [[Jim Wayne Miller]] (''The Brier Poems''), [[Gurney Norman]] (''Divine Right's Trip'', ''Kinfolks''), [[Ron Rash]] (''Serena''), [[Elizabeth Madox Roberts]] (\"The Great Meadow, \"The Time of Man\"), [[Thomas Wolfe]] (''Look Homeward Angel'', ''You Can't Go Home Again''), [[Rachel Carson]] (''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', ''[[Silent Spring]]''; [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]), and [[Jeannette Walls]] (''[[The Glass Castle]]'').\n\nAppalachian literature crosses with the larger genre of [[Southern literature]]. Internationally renowned writers such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Cormac McCarthy]] have made notable contributions to the American canon with tales set within Appalachia. McCarthy's ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979) is an intense vision of the squalidness and brutality of life along the [[Tennessee River]], in the heart of Appalachia. Other McCarthy novels set in Appalachia include ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'' (1968) and ''[[Child of God]]'' (1973). Appalachia also serves as the origin point for the kid, the protagonist of McCarthy's Western masterpiece ''[[Blood Meridian]]''. Faulkner's hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is on the borderlands of what is considered Appalachia, but his fictional [[Yoknapatawpha]] should be considered part of the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Almost all of the fiction which earned him the Nobel Prize is set there, including ''[[Light in August]]'' and ''[[Absalom, Absalom]]''.\n\n===Folklore===\n[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Statue of legendary railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] in [[Talcott, West Virginia]]]]\n\nAppalachian folklore has a strong mixture of European, Native American (especially [[Cherokee]]), and Biblical influences. The Cherokee taught the region's early European pioneers how to plant and cultivate crops such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] and how to find edible plants such as [[Allium tricoccum|ramps]].<ref name=handbook /> The Cherokee also passed along their knowledge of the medicinal properties of hundreds of native herbs and roots, and how to prepare tonics from such plants.<ref name=handbook /> Before the introduction of modern agricultural techniques in the region in the 1930s and 1940s, many Appalachian farmers followed the Biblical tradition of planting by \"the signs\", such as the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]], or when certain weather conditions occurred.<ref name=handbook />\n\nCherokee folklore continues to influence storytelling in the Appalachians, including depictions and characteristics of regional animals. As told by [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] and [[western North Carolina]] storyteller Jerry Wolfe, these creatures include the [[chipmunk]], also known as \"seven stripes\" from an angry [[bear]] scratching him down the back\u2014four claw marks and the spaces in between making seven\u2014and the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] who sneaks and thieves his way into becoming venomous.<ref>Kelley, Saundra Gerrell (2011). ''Southern Appalachian Storytellers: Interviews with Sixteen Keepers of the Oral Tradition''. Jefferson: McFarland Publishing. p. 205\u201307.</ref>\n\nAppalachian folk tales are rooted in English, Scottish, and Irish fairy tales, as well as regional heroic figures and events. [[Jack tales]], which tend to revolve around the exploits of a simple-but-dedicated figure named \"[[Jack (hero)|Jack]]\", are popular at story-telling festivals. Other stories involve wild animals, such as hunting tales. In the industrial areas of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia the composite [[Joe Magarac]] steelworker story has been handed down. Regional folk heroes such as the railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and frontiersmen [[Davy Crockett]], [[Mike Fink]] and [[Johnny Appleseed]] are examples of real-life figures that evolved into popular folk tale subjects. Murder stories, such as [[Omie Wise]] and [[John Hardy (song)|John Hardy]], are popular subjects for Appalachian ballads. Ghost stories, or \"[[:wiki:haint|haint]] tales\" in regional English,<ref>''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985</ref> are a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.<ref>Flora, Joseph M., Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, ''The Companion to Southern Literature'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], 2001, p. 304.</ref> Ghost stories native to the region include the story of the [[Greenbrier Ghost]], which is rooted in a [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia]], murder.<ref name=handbook>Deborah Thompson and Irene Moser, \"Appalachian Folklife\".

In the decades following the Great Depression and World War II, many Appalachian residents moved to industrial cities in the north and west in a migration that became known as the \"[[Hillbilly Highway]]\". Mechanization of coal mining during the 1950s and 1960s was the major source of unemployment in central Appalachia. Many migration streams covered relatively short distances, with West Virginians moving to [[Cleveland]] and other cities in eastern and central [[Ohio]], and eastern Kentuckians moving to [[Cincinnati]] and southwest Ohio in search of jobs. More distant cities like [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]] attracted migrants from many states. Enclaves of Appalachian culture can still be found in some of these communities.<ref>''Appalachian Odyssey'', ed. Phillip J. Obermiller et al. (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2000).</ref>\n\n===Communications===\nIn the 1940s through the 1960s, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], became a cultural center of the region because it had a [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station, [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]], which could be heard throughout the entirety of the eastern United States at night. Although Pittsburgh's [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] was a 50-kilowatt clear-channel station that dated back to the early 1920s (as well as spanning all the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in signal strength), WWVA prided itself on rural and farm programming that appealed to a wider audience in the rural region.  Cincinnati's [[WLW]] also was relied on by many in the central and northern areas of Appalachia.\n\nIn the southern part of the region, [[WSB-AM]] Atlanta and [[WSM-AM]] Nashville, flagship of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', were major stations for the region's population during the 20th century, and remain strong in the sub-region.\n\n===Appalachian studies===\n{{Main article|Appalachian studies}}\nAppalachia as an academic interest was the product of a critical scholarship that emerged across the disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s. With a renewed interest in issues of power, scholars could not dismiss the social inequity, class conflict, and environmental destruction encountered by [[United States|America's]] so-called \"[[Hillbilly|hillbillies]]\". Appalachia's emergence in academia is a result of the intersection between social conditions and critical academic interests, and has resulted in the development of many [[Appalachian studies]] programs in colleges and universities across the region, as well as in the [[Appalachian Studies Association]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Appalachia traditionally rested on agriculture, mining, timber, and in the cities, manufacturing. Since the late 20th century, [[tourism]] and second-home developments have assumed an increasingly major role.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Maggie-tower-view-nc1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A highland pasture near [[Maggie Valley, North Carolina]]]]\n\nWhile the climate of the Appalachian region is suitable for agriculture, the region's hilly terrain greatly limits the size of the average farm, a problem exacerbated by population growth in the latter half of the 19th century. [[Subsistence agriculture|Subsistence farming]] was the backbone of the Appalachian economy throughout much of the 19th century, and while economies in places such as western Pennsylvania, the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]] of Virginia, and the upper Tennessee Valley in east Tennessee, transitioned to a large-scale farming or manufacturing base around the time of the Civil War, subsistence farming remained an important part of the region's economy until the 1950s. In the early 20th century, Appalachian farmers were struggling to mechanize, and abusive farming practices had over the years left much of the already-limited farmland badly eroded. Various federal entities intervened in the 1930s to restore damaged areas and introduce less-harmful farming techniques. In recent decades, the concept of [[sustainable agriculture]] has been applied to the region's small farms, with some success. Nevertheless, the number of farms in the Appalachian region continues to dwindle, plunging from 354,748 farms on {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} in 1969 to 230,050 farms on {{convert|35|e6acre|km2}} in 1997.<ref name=agintro>Best, Michael, and Curtis Wood, Introduction to the Agriculture section in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Appalachia]]'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 395\u2013402.</ref>\n\nEarly Appalachian farmers grew both crops introduced from their native Europe as well as crops native to North America (such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]]). [[Tobacco]] has long been an important [[cash crop]] in Southern Appalachia, especially since the land is ill-suited for cash crops such as [[cotton]]. Apples have been grown in the region since the late 18th century, their cultivation being aided by the presence of thermal belts in the region's mountain valleys.  Hogs, which could [[free range]] in the region's abundant forests, often on [[chestnut]]s, were the most popular livestock among early Appalachian farmers. The [[American chestnut]] was also an important human food source until the [[chestnut blight]] struck in the 20th century. The early settlers also brought cattle and sheep to the region, which they would typically graze in highland meadows known as [[Appalachian balds|balds]] during the growing season when bottomlands were needed for crops. Cattle, mainly the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Angus cattle|Angus]], and [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] breeds, are now the region's chief livestock.<ref name=agintro />\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Erwin-millpond-sawmill-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sawmill and millpond in Erwin, West Virginia, photographed by [[Marion Post Wolcott]] in 1938]]\n\nThe mountains and valleys of Appalachia once contained what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of timber. The poor roads, lack of railroads, and general inaccessibility of the region, however, prevented large-scale logging in most of the region throughout much of the 19th century. While logging firms were established in the Carolinas and the [[Kentucky River]] valley before the Civil War, most major firms preferred to harvest the more accessible timber stands in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. By the 1880s, these stands had been exhausted, and a spike in the demand for lumber forced logging firms to seek out the virgin forests of Appalachia.<ref name=paulson>Paulson, Linda Daily, \"Lumber Industry\".

Arguably the most successful logging firm in Appalachia was the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company, established in 1927 and renamed [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 1948 when it expanded nationally. Although logging in Appalachia declined as the industry shifted focus to the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1950s, rising overseas demand in the 1980s brought a resurgence in Appalachian clogging. In 1987, there were 4,810 lumber firms operating in the region. In the late 1990s, the Appalachian lumber industry was a multibillion-dollar industry, employing 50,000 people in Tennessee, 26,000 in Kentucky, and 12,000 in West Virginia alone.<ref name=paulson /> By 1999, 1.4 million acres were extinguished as a result of [[deforestation]] by natural resource industries.{{Clarify|date=June 2017|Not clear how land can be \"extinguished\"}} Pollution from mining processes and disruption of the land ensued numerous environmental issues.

The region's vast coalfield covers {{convert|63000|sqmi|km2}} between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama, mostly along the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Allegheny Plateau]] regions. Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania, with smaller operations in [[western Maryland]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Pittsburgh coal seam]], which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century, has been called the world's most valuable mineral deposit. There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia, and over 80 in eastern Kentucky.

Hundreds of thousands of workers poured into the region from across the United States and from overseas, essentially overhauling the cultural makeup of [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. Mining corporations gained considerable influence in state and municipal governments, especially as they often owned the entire towns in which the miners lived. The mining industry was vulnerable to economic downturns, however, and booms and busts were frequent, with major booms occurring during World War I and II, and the worst bust occurring during the Great Depression. The Appalachian mining industry also saw some of the nation's bloodiest labor strife between the 1890s and the 1930s. Mining-related injuries and deaths were not uncommon, and ailments such as [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] afflicted miners throughout the 20th century. After World War II, innovations in mechanization (such as [[longwall mining]]) and competition from oil and natural gas led to a decline in the region's mining operations.<ref name=abramsoncoal /> Environmental restrictions, such as those placed on high-[[sulfur]] coal in the 1980s, brought further mine closures. While with annual earnings of $55,000, Appalachian miners make more than most other local workers, Appalachian coal mining employed just under 50,000 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_profile.pdf |format=PDF |title=Profile of the U.S. Coal Miner \u2013 2007 |publisher=[[National Mining Association]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_employment_state_region_method.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Coal Mine Employment by State, Region and Method of Mining \u2013 2007 |publisher=National Mining Association}}</ref>\n\nCoal mining has made a comeback in some regions in the early 21st century because of the increased prominence of [[Consol Energy]], based in [[Pittsburgh]].

Factory construction increased greatly after the Civil War, and the region experienced a manufacturing boom between 1890 and 1930. This economic shift led to a mass migration from small farms and rural areas to large urban centers, causing the populations of cities such as Birmingham, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], to swell exponentially. Manufacturing in the region suffered a setback during the Great Depression, but recovered during World War II and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. However, difficulties paying retiree benefits, environmental struggles, and the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 led to a decline in the region's manufacturing operations. Pittsburgh lost 44% of its factory jobs in the 1980s, and between 1970 and 2001, the number of [[apparel]] workers in the Appalachian region decreased from 250,000 to 83,000 and the number of textile workers decreased from 275,000 to 193,000.<ref name=hursteoa>Hurst, Jack, Introduction to Business, Technology, and Industry section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 441\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Steel]], founded in Pittsburgh in 1901, was the world's first corporation with more than a billion dollars in initial capitalization.<ref name=hursteoa /> Another Pittsburgh company, [[Alcoa]], helped establish the nation's [[aluminum]] industry in the early 20th century, and has had a significant impact on the economies of western Pennsylvania and east Tennessee.<ref>Barnett, Janice Willis, \"Aluminum Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 449\u201351.</ref> [[Union Carbide]] built the world's first [[petrochemical]] plant in [[Clendenin, West Virginia]], in 1920, and in subsequent years the [[Kanawha River|Kanawha Valley]] became known as the \"Chemical Capital of the World\".<ref>Egan, Martha Avaleen, \"Chemical Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 468\u201371.</ref> [[Eastman Chemical]], also established in 1920, is Tennessee's largest single employer.

The study covered 80 counties in six states approximating the area designated \"Southern Appalachia\" as defined by Thomas R. Ford's 1962 work. The states selected were Alabama (15 counties), Kentucky (12 counties), North Carolina (12 counties), Tennessee (14 counties), Virginia (12 counties), and West Virginia (15 counties).\n[[File:Map of counties included in the 1982 report of the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force.png|thumb|Map showing the 80 counties included in the 1982 report by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force]]\n\nIn its summary the report stated that \"over 55,000 parcels of property in 80 counties were studied, representing some 20,000,000 acres of land and mineral rights...\" It found that \"41% of the 20 million acres of land and minerals...are held by only 50 private owners and 10 government agencies. The federal government is the single largest owner in Appalachia, holding over 2,000,000 acres.\" The study found that the extractive industries, i.e., timber, coal, etc., were \"greatly underassessed for property tax purposes. Over 75% of the mineral owners in this survey pay under 25 cents per acre in property taxes.\" In the major coal counties surveyed the average tax per ton of known coal reserves is only $.0002 (1/50th of a cent).\nThe government-held lands are tax exempt, but the government makes a [[payment in lieu of taxes]], which is usually less than the normal tax rates.\n\n\"Taken together, the failure to tax minerals adequately, the underassessment of surface lands, and the revenue loss from concentrated federal holdings has a marked impact on local governments in Appalachia. The effect, essentially, is to produce a situation in which a) the small owners carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden; b) counties depend upon federal and state funds to provide revenues, while the large, corporate and absentee owners of the regions's resources go relatively tax-free; and c) citizens face a poverty of needed services despite the presence in their counties of taxable property wealth, especially in the form of coal and other natural resources.\"<ref>[http://www.crmw.net/files/1981_Land_Ownership_Study.pdf ''Land Ownership Patterns and Their Impacts on Appalachian Communities.

For instance, parts of Alabama and Mississippi were included in the commission because of problems with unemployment and poverty similar to those in Appalachia proper, and the ARC region extends into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] states, which are not traditionally considered part of Appalachia culturally (though a \"northern Appalachia\" identity has emerged in recent times in parts of both NY and PA, particularly in rural areas). More recently, the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], region was declared part of Appalachia by the ARC due to the [[economy of Youngstown, Ohio|collapse of the steel industry in the region]] in the early 1980s and the continuing unemployment problems in the region since, though aside from [[Columbiana County, Ohio]], the Youngstown [[Designated market area#Television|DMA]] isn't traditionally or culturally considered part of the region.<ref>[http://metromonthly.wordpress.com/2007/09/01/youngstown-appalachia/ Youngstown, Appalachia? \u2013 Metro Monthly].

With the exception of the October 1, 1940, opening of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], the region's mountainous terrain continuously thwarted major federal intervention attempts at major road construction until the 1970s. This left large parts of the region virtually isolated and slowing economic growth. Before the Civil War, major cities in the region were connected via wagon roads to lowland areas, and [[flatboat]]s provided an important means for transporting goods out of the region. By 1900, railroads connected most of the region with the rest of the nation, although the poor roads made travel beyond railroad hubs difficult. When the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in 1965, road construction was considered its most important initiative, and in subsequent decades the commission spent more on road construction than all other projects combined.<ref name=transeoa>Burton, Mark, and Richard Hatcher, Introduction to Transportation section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 685\u201390.</ref>\n\nThe effort to connect Appalachia with the outside world has required numerous civil engineering feats. Millions of tons of rock were removed to build road segments such as [[Interstate 40]] through the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line and [[U.S. Route 23]] in [[Letcher County, Kentucky]]. Large tunnels were built through mountain slopes at [[Cumberland Gap Tunnel|Cumberland Gap]] to speed up travel along [[U.S. Route 25E]]. The [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in West Virginia, completed in 1977, was the longest and is now the [[List of longest arch bridge spans|fourth-longest single-arch bridge]] in the world.

Early 20th century writers often engaged in [[yellow journalism]] focused on [[Sensationalism|sensationalistic]] aspects of the region's culture, such as [[moonshining]] and [[Appalachia#Feuds|clan feuding]], and often portrayed the region's inhabitants as uneducated and prone to impulsive acts of violence. Sociological studies in the 1960s and 1970s helped to re-examine and dispel these [[stereotype]]s.<ref name=abramson1>Abramson, Rudy. Introduction to ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. xix\u2013xxv.</ref>\n\nWhile endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with [[poverty]]. In the early 20th century, large-scale [[logging]] and [[coal mining]] firms brought wage-paying jobs and modern amenities to Appalachia, but by the 1960s the region had failed to capitalize on any long-term benefits<ref>{{cite web |last=Sokol |first=Anna |title=Economic Redevelopment in Appalachia: The Appalachian Regional Commission |url=http://www.umich.edu/~econdev/arc/ |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> from these two industries. Beginning in the 1930s, the federal government sought to alleviate poverty in the Appalachian region with a series of [[New Deal]] initiatives, such as the construction of [[dam]]s to provide cheap electricity and the implementation of better farming practices. On March 9, 1965, the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/newsevents/workshops/2011/participants/papers/12-Ziliak.pdf |title=The Appalachian Regional Development Act and Economic Change |last=Ziliak |first=James P. |date=September 16, 2010 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> was created to further alleviate poverty in the region, mainly by diversifying the region's economy and helping to provide better health care and educational opportunities to the region's inhabitants. By 1990, Appalachia had largely joined the economic mainstream, but still lagged behind the rest of the nation in most economic indicators.<ref name=abramson1/>\n\n==Defining the Appalachian region==\n{{See also|Social and economic stratification in Appalachia|List of Appalachian Regional Commission counties}}\n[[File:William-goodell-frost-1914.jpg|thumb|200px|left|William G. Frost]]\n\nSince Appalachia lacks definite physiographical or topographical boundaries, there has been some disagreement over what exactly the region encompasses. The most commonly used modern definition of Appalachia is the one initially defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965 and expanded over subsequent decades.<ref name=abramson1 /> The region defined by the Commission currently includes 420 counties and eight [[Independent city (Virginia)|independent cities]] in 13 states, including all of [[West Virginia]], 14 counties in [[New York (state)|New York]], 52 in [[Pennsylvania]], 32 in [[Ohio]], 3 in [[Maryland]], 54 in [[Kentucky]], 25 counties and 8 [[Administrative divisions of Virginia#Independent cities|cities]] in [[Virginia]],<ref>In Virginia, all municipalities incorporated as \"cities\" are legally separate from counties.</ref> 29 in [[North Carolina]], 52 in [[Tennessee]], 6 in [[South Carolina]], 37 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 37 in [[Alabama]], and 24 in [[Mississippi]].<ref name=arc1 /> When the Commission was established, counties were added based on economic need, however, rather than any cultural parameters.<ref name=abramson1 />\n\nThe first major attempt to map Appalachia as a distinctive cultural region came in the 1890s with the efforts of [[Berea College]] president William Goodell Frost, whose \"Appalachian America\" included 194 counties in 8 states.<ref name=williams>John Alexander Williams, ''Appalachia: A History'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002)</ref>{{rp|11\u201314}} In 1921, John C. Campbell published ''The Southern Highlander and His Homeland'' in which he modified Frost's map to include 254 counties in 9 states. A landmark survey of the region in the following decade by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] defined the region as consisting of 206 counties in 6 states. In 1984, Karl Raitz and Richard Ulack expanded the ARC's definition to include 445 counties in 13 states, although they removed all counties in Mississippi and added two in [[New Jersey]]. Historian John Alexander Williams, in his 2002 book ''Appalachia: A History'', distinguished between a \"core\" Appalachian region consisting of 164 counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, and a greater region defined by the ARC.<ref name=abramson1 /> In the ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (2006), [[Appalachian State University]] historian [[Howard Dorgan]] suggested the term \"Old Appalachia\" for the region's cultural boundaries, noting an academic tendency to ignore the southwestern and northeastern extremes of the ARC's pragmatic definition.<ref>Abramson, Rudy, and Jean Haskell, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1287\u201388.</ref> [[Sean Trende]], senior elections analyst at ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', defines \"Greater Appalachia\" in his 2012 book ''The Lost Majority'' as including both the [[Appalachian Mountains]] region ([[Western Virginia|western Virginia]] and [[Western North Carolina|North Carolina]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region in western South Carolina, West Virginia, [[Appalachian Ohio|southern Ohio]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], [[East Tennessee]], [[North Georgia|northern Georgia]], [[North Alabama|Alabama]], and [[North Mississippi|Mississippi]]) and the [[Upland South]] ([[Southern Indiana|southern Indiana]] and [[Southern Illinois|Illinois]], the [[Bluegrass region|Bluegrass]], [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Plateau]], [[Western Coal Field]], and [[Jackson Purchase]] regions in central and western Kentucky, [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[West Tennessee]], [[Missouri]], the [[Ozarks]] in Arkansas, [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]] and [[Southwestern Oklahoma]], [[North Texas|North]] and [[East Texas]], and the [[Texas Hill Country]]) following [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Protestant]] migrations to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trende|first=Sean|author-link=Sean Trende|title=The Lost Majority: Why the Future of Government Is Up for Grabs\u2013and Who Will Take It|year=2012|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=978-0230116467|pages=xxii\u2013xxviii|url=https://archive.org/details/lostmajoritywhyf0000tren}}</ref>\n\n===Toponymy and pronunciation===\n[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail of Gutierrez' 1562 map showing the first known cartographic appearance of a variant of the name \"Appalachia\"]]\n\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of [[Florida]] in 1528, the members of the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], including [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]], whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' ({{IPA-all|apa\u02c8lat\u0283en}}). The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled \"Appalachian\", it is the fourth oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S.<ref>After Florida, [[Dry Tortugas]] and [[Cape Canaveral]]: {{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart |first=George |authorlink=George R.

The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (cartographer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]]'s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.<ref>Walls, David (1977), \"On the Naming of Appalachia\", in ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56\u201376.</ref> Le Moyne was also the first European to apply \"Apalachen\" specifically to a mountain range as opposed to a village, native tribe, or a southeastern region of North America.<ref>Blaustein, Richard (2003), ''The Thistle and the Brier: Historical Links and Cultural Parallels Between Scotland and Appalachia'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the \"[[Allegheny Mountains]]\", \"Alleghenies\", and even \"Alleghania\". In the early 19th century, [[Washington Irving]] proposed renaming the United States either \"Appalachia\" or \"Alleghania\".<ref>[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967). ''Names on the Land''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref>\n\nIn northern U.S. dialects, the mountains are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u00e6|p|\u0259|\u02c8|l|e\u026a|t\u0283|\u0259n|z}} or {{IPAc-en|\u00e6|p|\u0259|\u02c8|l|e\u026a|\u0283|\u0259n|z}}.

The earliest discovered site is the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], which some scientists claim is pre-[[Clovis culture]]. Several other [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (8000\u20131000 BC) archaeological sites have been identified in the region, such as the [[St. Albans, West Virginia|St. Albans]] site in West Virginia and the [[Icehouse Bottom]] site in Tennessee. In the 16th century, the de Soto and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expeditions explored the mountains of South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and encountered complex agrarian societies consisting of [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking]] inhabitants. De Soto indicated that much of the region west of the mountains was part of the domain of [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], a [[paramount chief]]dom centered around a village complex in northern Georgia.<ref>Hudson, Charles. ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566\u20131568'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 17.</ref> By the time English explorers arrived in Appalachia in the late 17th century, the central part of the region was controlled by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes (namely the [[Shawnee]]) and the southern part of the region was controlled by the [[Cherokee]]. The [[New France|French]] based in modern-day [[Quebec]] also made inroads into the northern areas of the region in modern-day New York state and Pennsylvania. By the mid 18th century the French had outposts such as [[Fort Duquesne]] and [[Fort Le Boeuf]] controlling the access points of the [[Allegheny River]] valley and upper [[Ohio valley]] after exploration by [[Celeron de Bienville]].\n\n[[File:George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|''Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the [[Cumberland Gap]]'' ([[George Caleb Bingham]], oil on canvas, 1851\u201352)]]\n\nEuropean migration into Appalachia began in the 18th century. As lands in eastern Pennsylvania, the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] and [[the Carolinas]] filled up, immigrants began pushing further and further westward into the Appalachian Mountains. A relatively large proportion of the early [[backcountry]] immigrants were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]\u2014later known as \"[[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]]\"\u2014 who were seeking cheaper land and freedom from [[Quakers|Quaker]] leaders, many of whom considered the Scotch-Irish \"savages\". Others included [[Germans]] from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region and English settlers from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] country. Between 1730 and 1763, immigrants trickled into [[western Pennsylvania]], the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area of Virginia, and [[western Maryland]]. [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker's]] discovery of [[Cumberland Gap]] in 1750 and the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 lured settlers deeper into the mountains, namely to upper [[east Tennessee]], northwestern North Carolina, [[upstate South Carolina]], and central Kentucky. Between 1790 and 1840, a series of treaties with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes opened up lands in [[north Georgia (U.S. state)|north Georgia]], [[north Alabama]], the [[Tennessee Valley]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] regions, and the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] along what is now the Tennessee-North Carolina border.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|30\u201344}} The last of these treaties culminated in the removal of the bulk of the Cherokee population (as well as [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]] and others) from the region via the [[Trail of Tears]] from 1831 until 1838.\n\n===The Appalachian frontier===\n[[File:Earnest-fort-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Earnest Fort-house in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. Built around 1782 during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]], it is located just south of [[Chuckey, Tennessee|Chuckey]] on the banks of the [[Nolichucky River]].]]\n\nAppalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a [[coonskin cap]] and [[buckskins|buckskin clothing]], and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped [[powder horn]]. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than [[Daniel Boone]] (1734\u20131820), a [[long hunter]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from \"civilization\" by high mountain ridges, and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century.<ref name=Caudill>Caudill, Harry. ''Night Comes to the Cumberlands''</ref>{{rp|7\u201313, 19}}\n\nAs early as the 18th century, Appalachia (then known simply as the \"backcountry\") began to distinguish itself from its wealthier lowland and coastal neighbors to the east. Frontiersmen often bickered with lowland and [[tidewater region|tidewater]] \"elites\" over taxes, sometimes to the point of armed revolts such as the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] (1767\u20131771) in North Carolina.<ref name=drake>Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)</ref>{{rp|59\u201369}} In 1778, at the height of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], backwoodsmen from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and what is now Kentucky took part in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s [[Illinois campaign]]. Two years later, a group of Appalachian frontiersmen known as the [[Overmountain Men]] routed British forces at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] after rejecting a call by the British to disarm.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|64\u201368}} After the war, residents throughout the Appalachian backcountry\u2014especially the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] region in western Pennsylvania, and [[antebellum South|antebellum]] northwestern Virginia (now the north-central part of West Virginia) \u2014 refused to pay a tax placed on whiskey by the new American government, leading to what became known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref name=williams/>{{rp|118\u201319}} The resulting tighter Federal controls in the Monongahela valley resulted in many whiskey/bourbon makers migrating via the Ohio River to Kentucky and Tennessee where the industry could flourish.\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn the early 19th century, the rift between the [[yeoman]] farmers of Appalachia and their wealthier lowland counterparts continued to grow, especially as the latter dominated most state legislatures. People in Appalachia began to feel slighted over what they considered unfair taxation methods and lack of state funding for improvements (especially for roads). In the northern half of the region, the lowland \"elites\" consisted largely of industrial and business interests, whereas in the parts of the region south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], the lowland elites consisted of large-scale land-owning [[plantations in the American South|planters]].<ref name=drake/>{{rp|59\u201369}} The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], formed in the 1830s, drew widespread support from disaffected Appalachians.\n\nTensions between the mountain counties and state governments sometimes reached the point of mountain counties threatening to break off and form separate states.

Sentiments in northern Appalachia had shifted to the pro-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In southern Appalachia, abolitionists still constituted a radical minority, although several smaller opposition parties (most of which were both pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and pro-slavery) were formed to oppose the planter-dominated [[Southern Democrats]]. As states in the southern United States moved toward [[secession]], a majority of Southern Appalachians still supported the Union.<ref name=mckinney1>Gordon McKinney, \"The Civil War\".

After Virginia voted to secede, several mountain counties in northwestern Virginia rejected the ordinance and with the help of the [[Union Army]] established a separate state, admitted to the Union as West Virginia in 1863. However, half the counties included in the new state, comprising two-thirds of its territory, were secessionist and pro-Confederate.<ref>Curry, Richard O.

While there were two major theaters of operation in the region\u2014namely the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia (and present-day West Virginia) and the [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] area along the Tennessee-Georgia border\u2014much of the violence was caused by [[bushwhacker]]s and [[guerrilla war]]. The northernmost battles of the entire war were fought in Appalachia with the [[Battle of Buffington Island]] and the [[Battle of Salineville]] resulting from [[Morgan's Raid]]. Large numbers of livestock were killed (grazing was an important part of Appalachia's economy), and numerous farms were destroyed, pillaged, or neglected.<ref name=mckinney1 /> The actions of both Union and Confederate armies left many inhabitants in the region resentful of government authority and suspicious of outsiders for decades after the war.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=Caudill/>{{rp|39\u201345}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\n\n====Economic boom====\n[[File:West-virginia-mine-entrance1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Entrance to mine shaft in West Virginia, photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] in 1908]]\n\nAfter the war, northern parts of Appalachia experienced an economic boom, while economies in the southern parts of the region stagnated, especially as Southern Democrats regained control of their respective state legislatures at the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=mckinney1 /> [[Pittsburgh]] as well as [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] grew into major industrial centers, especially regarding iron and steel production. By 1900, the Chattanooga area and north Georgia and northern Alabama had experienced similar changes due to manufacturing booms in [[Atlanta]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] at the edge of the Appalachian region. Railroad construction between the 1880s and early 20th century gave the greater nation access to the vast coalfields in central Appalachia, making the [[Appalachian Land Ownership Survey|economy]] in that part of the region practically synonymous with coal mining. As the nationwide demand for lumber skyrocketed, lumber firms turned to the virgin forests of southern Appalachia, using sawmill and logging railroad innovations to reach remote timber stands. The [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] area of Tennessee and Virginia and the [[Kanawha Valley]] of West Virginia became major [[petrochemical]] production centers.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|131\u2013141}}\n\n====Stereotypes====\n{{main|Appalachian stereotypes}}\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the development of various regional stereotypes. Attempts by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to enforce the whiskey tax in the late 1870s led to an explosion in violence between Appalachian \"[[moonshine]]rs\" and federal \"revenuers\" that lasted through the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] period in the 1920s.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u2013193}} The breakdown of authority and law enforcement during the Civil War may have contributed to an increase in clan feuding, which by the 1880s was reported to be a problem across most of Kentucky's Cumberland region as well as [[Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County]] in Tennessee, [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]] in Virginia, and [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo]] and [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan]] counties in West Virginia.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u201393}} Regional writers from this period such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]] and [[Horace Kephart]] liked to focus on such sensational aspects of mountain culture, leading readers outside the region to believe they were more widespread than in reality. In an 1899 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Berea College]] president William G. Frost attempted to redefine the inhabitants of Appalachia as \"noble mountaineers\"\u2014relics of the nation's pioneer period whose isolation had left them unaffected by modern times.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}}\n\nToday, residents of Appalachia are viewed by many Americans as uneducated and unrefined, resulting in culture-based stereotyping and [[discrimination]] in many areas, including employment and housing. Such discrimination has prompted some to seek redress under prevailing federal and state [[civil rights]] laws.<ref>E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. \"Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition\", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).</ref>\n\n====Feuds====\nAppalachia, and especially Kentucky, became nationally known for its violent [[feud]]s, especially in the remote mountain districts. They pitted the men in extended clans against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with [[ambush]]es, [[gunfight]]s, and pre-arranged [[shootout]]s. The infamous [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|Hatfield-McCoy Feud]] of the 19th century was the best known of these family feuds. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes.<ref>Otterbein, Keith F. \"Five Feuds: An Analysis of Homicides in Eastern Kentucky in the Late Nineteenth Century\", ''American Anthropologist'', June 2000, Vol. 102 Issue 2, pp 231\u201343, provides a theoretical analysis.</ref> Journalists often wrote about the violence, using stereotypes that \"city folks\" had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the natural products of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps even [[inbreeding]]. In reality, the leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who were fighting for local political power.<ref>Billings, Dwight B., and [[Kathleen M. Blee]], \"'Where the Sun Set Crimson and the Moon Rose Red': Writing Appalachia and the Kentucky Mountain Feuds\", ''Southern Cultures'', Summer 1996, Vol. 2 Issue 3/4, pp 329\u2013352</ref>\n\n===Modern Appalachia===\nLogging firms' rapid devastation of the forests of the Appalachians sparked a movement among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] to preserve what remained and allow the land to \"heal\". In 1911, Congress passed the [[Weeks Act]], giving the federal government authority to create [[United States National Forest|national forests]] east of the Mississippi River and control timber harvesting. Regional writers and business interests led a movement to create national parks in the eastern United States similar to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] in the west, culminating in the creation of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in Tennessee and North Carolina, [[Shenandoah National Park]] in Virginia, [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]] in Kentucky,  Virginia and Tennessee, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (connecting the two) in the 1930s.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|200\u2013210}} During the same period, New England forester [[Benton MacKaye]] led the movement to build the {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Appalachian Trail]], stretching from Georgia to [[Maine]].\n\nBy the 1950s, poor farming techniques and the loss of jobs to [[mechanization]] in the mining industry had left much of central and southern Appalachia poverty-stricken. The lack of jobs also led to widespread difficulties with [[emigration|outmigration]]. Beginning in the 1930s, federal agencies such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] began investing in the Appalachian region.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|310\u201312}} [[Sociologist]]s such as James Brown and Cratis Williams and authors such as [[Harry Caudill]] and [[Michael Harrington]] brought attention to the region's plight in the 1960s, prompting Congress to create the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965.

Religion in Appalachia is characterized by a sense of independence and a distrust of religious [[hierarchical organization|hierarchies]], both rooted in the [[evangelical]] tendencies of the region's pioneers, many of whom had been influenced by the \"[[New Light]]\" movement in England. Many of the denominations brought from Europe underwent modifications or factioning during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (especially the [[holiness movement]]) in the early 19th century. A number of 18th and 19th-century religious traditions are still practiced in parts of Appalachia, including natural water (or \"creek\") [[baptism]], rhythmically chanted preaching, congregational shouting, [[snake handling]], and [[foot washing]]. While most church-goers in Appalachia attend fairly well organized churches affiliated with regional or national bodies, small unaffiliated congregations are not uncommon in rural mountain areas.<ref>Dorgan, Howard, Introduction to the \"Religion\" section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1281\u201389.</ref><ref name=grammich />\n\n[[Protestantism]] is the most dominant denomination in Appalachia, although there is a significant [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic]] presence in the northern half of the region and in urban areas, like Pittsburgh and Scranton.

The Northern Midland dialect is spoken in the northern parts of the region, while [[Pittsburgh English]] (more commonly known as \"Pittsburghese\") is strongly influenced by Appalachian dialect.<ref name=\"Johnstone PBS\">{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Barbara |title=Steel Town Speak |journal=[[Language magazine]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/pittsburghese/ |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref> The Southern Appalachian dialect is considered part of the [[Southern American English|Southern American dialect]],<ref>Labov, William, Sharon Ash & Charles Boberg, ''Atlas of North American English'', Mouton de Gruyter, 2005</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/MapsS/Map1S.html|title=South Regional Map|website=www.ling.upenn.edu}}</ref> although the two are distinguished by the [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]] nature of the Appalachian dialect. Early 20th century writers believed the Appalachian dialect to be a surviving relic of Old World Scottish or Elizabethan dialects. Recent research suggests, however, that while the dialect has a stronger Scottish influence than other American dialects, most of its distinguishing characteristics have developed in the United States.<ref>Montgomery, Montgomery, \"Language \u2013 Introduction\", ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 999\u20131004.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nFor much of the region's history, education in Appalachia has lagged behind the rest of the nation due in part to struggles with funding from respective state governments and an agrarian-oriented population that often failed to see a practical need for formal education. Early education in the region evolved from teaching Christian morality and learning to read the [[Bible]] into small, [[one-room school]]houses that convened in months when children were not needed to help with farm work. After the Civil War, mandatory education laws and state assistance helped larger communities begin to establish graded schools and high schools. During the same period, many of the region's institutions of higher education were established or greatly expanded.<ref name=deyoung>DeYoung, Alan, Introduction to Education section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1517\u201321.</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, service organizations such as [[Pi Beta Phi]] and various religious organizations established [[settlement school]]s and mission schools in the region's more rural areas.<ref>Alvic, Philis, \"Settlement, Mission, and Sponsored Schools\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1551.</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, national trends began to have more of an effect on education in Appalachia, sometimes clashing with the region's traditional values. The [[Scopes Trial]]\u2014the nation's most publicized debate over the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]]\u2014took place in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], in southern Appalachia in 1925. In spite of consolidation and centralization, schools in Appalachia struggled to keep up with federal and state demands into the 21st century. Since 2001, a number of the region's public schools were threatened with loss of funding due to difficulties fulfilling the demands of [[No Child Left Behind]].<ref name=deyoung />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main article|Appalachian music}}\nAppalachian music is one of the best-known manifestations of Appalachian culture. Traditional Appalachian music is derived primarily from the English and Scottish [[ballad]] tradition and Irish and Scottish [[fiddle]] music. African-American [[blues]] musicians played a significant role in developing the instrumental aspects of Appalachian music, most notably with the introduction of the five-stringed [[banjo]]\u2014one of the region's iconic symbols\u2014in the late 18th century. Another instrument known in Appalachian culture was the [[Appalachian dulcimer]] which, in a practical way, is a guitar-shaped instrument laid on its side with a flat bottom and the strings plucked in a manner to make alternating notes.\n\nIn the years following World War I, British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] brought attention to Southern Appalachia when he noted that its inhabitants still sang hundreds of English and Scottish ballads that had been passed down to them from their ancestors. Commercial recordings of Appalachian musicians in the 1920s would have a significant impact on the development of [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[old-time music]]. Appalachian music saw a resurgence in popularity during the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s, when musicologists such as [[Mike Seeger]], [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], and [[Ralph Rinzler]] traveled to remote parts of the region in search of musicians unaffected by modern music. Today, dozens of annual music festivals held throughout the region preserve the Appalachian music tradition.<ref>Olson, Ted, \"Music \u2013 Introduction\".

Travellers' accounts published in 19th-century magazines gave rise to Appalachian [[American literary regionalism|local color]], which reached its height with [[George Washington Harris]]'s Sut Lovingood character of the 1860s and native novelists such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]]. Works such as [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s ''Life in the Iron Mills'' (1861), [[Emma Bell Miles]]' ''The Spirit of the Mountains'' (1905), Catherine Marshall's ''[[Christy (novel)|Christy]]'' (1912), [[Horace Kephart]]'s ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]'' (1913) marked a shift in the region's literature from local color to realism. The transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society and its effects on Appalachia are captured in works such as [[Olive Tilford Dargan]]'s ''Call Home to the Heart'' (1932), [[Agnes Sligh Turnbull]]'s ''[[The Rolling Years]]'' (1936), [[James Still]]'s ''The River of Earth'' (1940), [[Harriette Simpson Arnow]]'s ''The Dollmaker'' (1954), and [[Harry Caudill]]'s ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'' (1962). In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of authors like [[Breece D'J Pancake]], [[Dorothy Allison]], and [[Lisa Alther]] brought greater literary diversity to the region.<ref name=toney>Edwards, Grace Toney, \"Literature \u2013 Introduction\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1035\u201339.</ref>\n\nAlong with the above-mentioned, some of Appalachia's best known writers include [[James Agee]] (''[[A Death in the Family]]''), [[Anne W.

Internationally renowned writers such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Cormac McCarthy]] have made notable contributions to the American canon with tales set within Appalachia. McCarthy's ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979) is an intense vision of the squalidness and brutality of life along the [[Tennessee River]], in the heart of Appalachia. Other McCarthy novels set in Appalachia include ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'' (1968) and ''[[Child of God]]'' (1973). Appalachia also serves as the origin point for the kid, the protagonist of McCarthy's Western masterpiece ''[[Blood Meridian]]''. Faulkner's hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is on the borderlands of what is considered Appalachia, but his fictional [[Yoknapatawpha]] should be considered part of the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Almost all of the fiction which earned him the Nobel Prize is set there, including ''[[Light in August]]'' and ''[[Absalom, Absalom]]''.\n\n===Folklore===\n[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Statue of legendary railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] in [[Talcott, West Virginia]]]]\n\nAppalachian folklore has a strong mixture of European, Native American (especially [[Cherokee]]), and Biblical influences. The Cherokee taught the region's early European pioneers how to plant and cultivate crops such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] and how to find edible plants such as [[Allium tricoccum|ramps]].<ref name=handbook /> The Cherokee also passed along their knowledge of the medicinal properties of hundreds of native herbs and roots, and how to prepare tonics from such plants.<ref name=handbook /> Before the introduction of modern agricultural techniques in the region in the 1930s and 1940s, many Appalachian farmers followed the Biblical tradition of planting by \"the signs\", such as the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]], or when certain weather conditions occurred.<ref name=handbook />\n\nCherokee folklore continues to influence storytelling in the Appalachians, including depictions and characteristics of regional animals. As told by [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] and [[western North Carolina]] storyteller Jerry Wolfe, these creatures include the [[chipmunk]], also known as \"seven stripes\" from an angry [[bear]] scratching him down the back\u2014four claw marks and the spaces in between making seven\u2014and the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] who sneaks and thieves his way into becoming venomous.<ref>Kelley, Saundra Gerrell (2011). ''Southern Appalachian Storytellers: Interviews with Sixteen Keepers of the Oral Tradition''. Jefferson: McFarland Publishing. p. 205\u201307.</ref>\n\nAppalachian folk tales are rooted in English, Scottish, and Irish fairy tales, as well as regional heroic figures and events. [[Jack tales]], which tend to revolve around the exploits of a simple-but-dedicated figure named \"[[Jack (hero)|Jack]]\", are popular at story-telling festivals. Other stories involve wild animals, such as hunting tales. In the industrial areas of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia the composite [[Joe Magarac]] steelworker story has been handed down. Regional folk heroes such as the railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and frontiersmen [[Davy Crockett]], [[Mike Fink]] and [[Johnny Appleseed]] are examples of real-life figures that evolved into popular folk tale subjects. Murder stories, such as [[Omie Wise]] and [[John Hardy (song)|John Hardy]], are popular subjects for Appalachian ballads. Ghost stories, or \"[[:wikt:haint|haint]] tales\" in regional English,<ref>''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985</ref> are a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.<ref>Flora, Joseph M., Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W.

In the decades following the Great Depression and World War II, many Appalachian residents moved to industrial cities in the north and west in a migration that became known as the \"[[Hillbilly Highway]]\". Mechanization of coal mining during the 1950s and 1960s was the major source of unemployment in central Appalachia. Many migration streams covered relatively short distances, with West Virginians moving to [[Cleveland]] and other cities in eastern and central [[Ohio]], and eastern Kentuckians moving to [[Cincinnati]] and southwest Ohio in search of jobs. More distant cities like [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]] attracted migrants from many states. Enclaves of Appalachian culture can still be found in some of these communities.<ref>''Appalachian Odyssey'', ed. Phillip J. Obermiller et al. (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2000).</ref>\n\n===Communications===\nIn the 1940s through the 1960s, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], became a cultural center of the region because it had a [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station, [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]], which could be heard throughout the entirety of the eastern United States at night. Although Pittsburgh's [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] was a 50 kilowatt clear channel station that dated back to the early 1920s (as well as spanning all the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in signal strength), WWVA prided itself on rural and farm programming that appealed to a wider audience in the rural region.  Cincinnati's [[WLW]] also was relied on by many in the central and northern areas of Appalachia.\n\nIn the southern part of the region, [[WSB-AM]] Atlanta and [[WSM-AM]] Nashville, flagship of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', were major stations for the region's population during the 20th century, and remain strong in the sub-region.\n\n===Appalachian studies===\n{{Main article|Appalachian studies}}\nAppalachia as an academic interest was the product of a critical scholarship that emerged across the disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s. With a renewed interest in issues of power, scholars could not dismiss the social inequity, class conflict, and environmental destruction encountered by [[United States|America's]] so-called \"[[Hillbilly|hillbillies]]\". Appalachia's emergence in academia is a result of the intersection between social conditions and critical academic interests, and has resulted in the development of many [[Appalachian studies]] programs in colleges and universities across the region, as well as in the [[Appalachian Studies Association]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Appalachia traditionally rested on agriculture, mining, timber, and in the cities, manufacturing. Since the late 20th century, [[tourism]] and second-home developments have assumed an increasingly major role.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Maggie-tower-view-nc1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A highland pasture near [[Maggie Valley, North Carolina]]]]\n\nWhile the climate of the Appalachian region is suitable for agriculture, the region's hilly terrain greatly limits the size of the average farm, a problem exacerbated by population growth in the latter half of the 19th century. [[Subsistence agriculture|Subsistence farming]] was the backbone of the Appalachian economy throughout much of the 19th century, and while economies in places such as western Pennsylvania, the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]] of Virginia, and the upper Tennessee Valley in east Tennessee, transitioned to a large-scale farming or manufacturing base around the time of the Civil War, subsistence farming remained an important part of the region's economy until the 1950s. In the early 20th century, Appalachian farmers were struggling to mechanize, and abusive farming practices had over the years left much of the already-limited farmland badly eroded. Various federal entities intervened in the 1930s to restore damaged areas and introduce less-harmful farming techniques. In recent decades, the concept of [[sustainable agriculture]] has been applied to the region's small farms, with some success. Nevertheless, the number of farms in the Appalachian region continues to dwindle, plunging from 354,748 farms on {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} in 1969 to 230,050 farms on {{convert|35|e6acre|km2}} in 1997.<ref name=agintro>Best, Michael, and Curtis Wood, Introduction to the Agriculture section in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Appalachia]]'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 395\u2013402.</ref>\n\nEarly Appalachian farmers grew both crops introduced from their native Europe as well as crops native to North America (such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]]). [[Tobacco]] has long been an important [[cash crop]] in Southern Appalachia, especially since the land is ill-suited for cash crops such as [[cotton]]. Apples have been grown in the region since the late 18th century, their cultivation being aided by the presence of thermal belts in the region's mountain valleys.  Hogs, which could [[free range]] in the region's abundant forests, often on [[chestnut]]s, were the most popular livestock among early Appalachian farmers. The [[American chestnut]] was also an important human food source until the [[chestnut blight]] struck in the 20th century. The early settlers also brought cattle and sheep to the region, which they would typically graze in highland meadows known as [[Appalachian balds|balds]] during the growing season when bottomlands were needed for crops. Cattle, mainly the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Angus cattle|Angus]], and [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] breeds, are now the region's chief livestock.<ref name=agintro />\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Erwin-millpond-sawmill-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sawmill and millpond in Erwin, West Virginia, photographed by [[Marion Post Wolcott]] in 1938]]\n\nThe mountains and valleys of Appalachia once contained what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of timber. The poor roads, lack of railroads, and general inaccessibility of the region, however, prevented large-scale logging in most of the region throughout much of the 19th century. While logging firms were established in the Carolinas and the [[Kentucky River]] valley before the Civil War, most major firms preferred to harvest the more accessible timber stands in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. By the 1880s, these stands had been exhausted, and a spike in the demand for lumber forced logging firms to seek out the virgin forests of Appalachia.<ref name=paulson>Paulson, Linda Daily, \"Lumber Industry\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 501\u201304.</ref> The first major logging ventures in Appalachia transported logs using mule teams or rivers, the latter method sometimes employing [[splash dam]]s.<ref>Weals, Vic. ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville, Tennessee: Olden Press, 1993), pp. 1\u20138.</ref> In the 1890s, innovations such as the [[Shay locomotive]], the steam-powered loader, and the steam-powered [[skidder]] allowed massive harvesting of the most remote forest sections.<ref name=paulson />\n\nLogging in Appalachia reached its peak in the early 20th century, when firms such as the Ritter Lumber Company cut the virgin forests on an alarming scale, leading to the creation of [[United States National Forest|national forests]] in 1911 and similar state entities to better manage the region's timber resources. Arguably the most successful logging firm in Appalachia was the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company, established in 1927 and renamed [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 1948 when it expanded nationally. Although logging in Appalachia declined as the industry shifted focus to the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1950s, rising overseas demand in the 1980s brought a resurgence in Appalachian logging. In 1987, there were 4,810 lumber firms operating in the region. In the late 1990s, the Appalachian lumber industry was a multibillion-dollar industry, employing 50,000 people in Tennessee, 26,000 in Kentucky, and 12,000 in West Virginia alone.<ref name=paulson /> By 1999, 1.4 million acres were extinguished as a result of [[deforestation]] by natural resource industries.{{Clarify|date=June 2017|Not clear how land can be \"extinguished\"}} Pollution from mining processes and disruption of the land ensued numerous environmental issues.

At present, however, the mining industry employs just 2% of the Appalachian workforce. The region's vast coalfield covers {{convert|63000|sqmi|km2}} between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama, mostly along the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Allegheny Plateau]] regions. Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania, with smaller operations in [[western Maryland]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Pittsburgh coal seam]], which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century, has been called the world's most valuable mineral deposit. There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia, and over 80 in eastern Kentucky. Most of the coal mined is [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], although significant [[anthracite]] deposits exist on the fringe of the region in central Pennsylvania.<ref name=abramsoncoal>Abramson, Rudy, \"Bituminous Coal Industry\".

Hundreds of thousands of workers poured into the region from across the United States and from overseas, essentially overhauling the cultural makeup of [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. Mining corporations gained considerable influence in state and municipal governments, especially as they often owned the entire towns in which the miners lived. The mining industry was vulnerable to economic downturns, however, and booms and busts were frequent, with major booms occurring during World War I and II, and the worst bust occurring during the Great Depression. The Appalachian mining industry also saw some of the nation's bloodiest labor strife between the 1890s and the 1930s. Mining-related injuries and deaths were not uncommon, and ailments such as [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] afflicted miners throughout the 20th century. After World War II, innovations in mechanization (such as [[longwall mining]]) and competition from oil and natural gas led to a decline in the region's mining operations.<ref name=abramsoncoal /> Environmental restrictions, such as those placed on high-[[sulfur]] coal in the 1980s, brought further mine closures. While with annual earnings of $55,000, Appalachian miners make more than most other local workers, Appalachian coal mining employed just under 50,000 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_profile.pdf |format=PDF |title=Profile of the U.S. Coal Miner \u2013 2007 |publisher=[[National Mining Association]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_employment_state_region_method.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Coal Mine Employment by State, Region and Method of Mining \u2013 2007 |publisher=National Mining Association}}</ref>\n\nCoal mining has made a comeback in some regions in the early 21st century because of the increased prominence of [[Consol Energy]], based in [[Pittsburgh]]. The [[Quecreek Mine rescue]] in 2002 and continuing [[mine subsidence]] problems in abandoned coal mines in [[western Pennsylvania]] as well as the [[Sago Mine disaster]] and [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in West Virginia and other regions have also been highlighted in recent times.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Manufacturing===\n[[File:Institute-plant-tanks-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Storage tanks at the [[Institute, West Virginia|Institute]] plant along the [[Kanawha River]] in West Virginia, photographed late 1930s/early 1940s]]\n\nThe manufacturing industry in Appalachia is rooted primarily in the ironworks and steelworks of early [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and in the textile mills that sprang up in North Carolina's [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region in the mid-19th century. Factory construction increased greatly after the Civil War, and the region experienced a manufacturing boom between 1890 and 1930. This economic shift led to a mass migration from small farms and rural areas to large urban centers, causing the populations of cities such as Birmingham, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], to swell exponentially. Manufacturing in the region suffered a setback during the Great Depression, but recovered during World War II and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. However, difficulties paying retiree benefits, environmental struggles, and the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 led to a decline in the region's manufacturing operations. Pittsburgh lost 44% of its factory jobs in the 1980s, and between 1970 and 2001, the number of [[apparel]] workers in the Appalachian region decreased from 250,000 to 83,000 and the number of textile workers decreased from 275,000 to 193,000.<ref name=hursteoa>Hurst, Jack, Introduction to Business, Technology, and Industry section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 441\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Steel]], founded in Pittsburgh in 1901, was the world's first corporation with more than a billion dollars in initial capitalization.<ref name=hursteoa /> Another Pittsburgh company, [[Alcoa]], helped establish the nation's [[aluminum]] industry in the early 20th century, and has had a significant impact on the economies of western Pennsylvania and east Tennessee.<ref>Barnett, Janice Willis, \"Aluminum Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 449\u201351.</ref> [[Union Carbide]] built the world's first [[petrochemical]] plant in [[Clendenin, West Virginia]], in 1920, and in subsequent years the [[Kanawha River|Kanawha Valley]] became known as the \"Chemical Capital of the World\".<ref>Egan, Martha Avaleen, \"Chemical Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 468\u201371.</ref> [[Eastman Chemical]], also established in 1920, is Tennessee's largest single employer.

The end of World War I (which opened up travel opportunities to Europe) and the arrival of the automobile (which changed the nation's vacation habits) led to the demise of all but a few of the region's spa resorts. The establishment of national parks in the 1930s brought an explosion of tourist traffic to the region, but created problems with [[urban sprawl]] in the various host communities.

The states selected were Alabama (15 counties), Kentucky (12 counties), North Carolina (12 counties), Tennessee (14 counties), Virginia (12 counties), and West Virginia (15 counties).\n[[File:Map of counties included in the 1982 report of the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force.png|thumb|Map showing the 80 counties included in the 1982 report by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force]]\n\nIn its summary the report stated that \"over 55,000 parcels of property in 80 counties were studied, representing some 20,000,000 acres of land and mineral rights...\" It found that \"41% of the 20 million acres of land and minerals...are held by only 50 private owners and 10 government agencies. The federal government is the single largest owner in Appalachia, holding over 2,000,000 acres.\" The study found that the extractive industries, i.e., timber, coal, etc., were \"greatly underassessed for property tax purposes. Over 75% of the mineral owners in this survey pay under 25 cents per acre in property taxes.\" In the major coal counties surveyed the average tax per ton of known coal reserves is only $.0002 (1/50th of a cent).\nThe government-held lands are tax exempt, but the government makes a [[payment in lieu of taxes]], which is usually less than the normal tax rates.\n\n\"Taken together, the failure to tax minerals adequately, the underassessment of surface lands, and the revenue loss from concentrated federal holdings has a marked impact on local governments in Appalachia. The effect, essentially, is to produce a situation in which a) the small owners carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden; b) counties depend upon federal and state funds to provide revenues, while the large, corporate and absentee owners of the regions's resources go relatively tax-free; and c) citizens face a poverty of needed services despite the presence in their counties of taxable property wealth, especially in the form of coal and other natural resources.\"<ref>[http://www.crmw.net/files/1981_Land_Ownership_Study.pdf ''Land Ownership Patterns and Their Impacts on Appalachian Communities. A Survey of 80 Counties''], pgs. 27\u201329</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a similar study that concentrated solely on West Virginia found that 25 private owners hold 17.6% of the state's private land of 13 million acres. The federal government owns 1,133,587 acres in West Virginia, 7.4% of the total state acreage of 15,410,560 acres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42346.pdf|title=Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data}}</ref> In 11 counties the top ten absentee landowners own 41% to almost 72% of the private land in each county.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wvpolicy.org/who-owns-west-virginia-in-the-21st-century-2/|title=Who Owns West Virginia in the 21st Century?|date=November 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Appalachian Regional Commission===\n{{main article|Appalachian Regional Commission}}\nThe [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] (ARC) was created by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1965 to bring poor areas of the 13 U.S. states of the main (southern) range of the Appalachians into the mainstream of the American economy. The commission is a partnership of federal, state, and local governments, and was created to promote economic growth and improve the quality of life in the region.

The ARC is a planning, research, advocacy and funding organization; it does not have any governing powers.\n\nThe ARC's geographic range of coverage was defined broadly so as to cover as many economically underdeveloped areas as possible; it extends well beyond the area usually thought of as \"Appalachia\". For instance, parts of Alabama and Mississippi were included in the commission because of problems with unemployment and poverty similar to those in Appalachia proper, and the ARC region extends into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] states, which are not traditionally considered part of Appalachia culturally (though a \"northern Appalachia\" identity has emerged in recent times in parts of both NY and PA, particularly in rural areas). More recently, the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], region was declared part of Appalachia by the ARC due to the [[economy of Youngstown, Ohio|collapse of the steel industry in the region]] in the early 1980s and the continuing unemployment problems in the region since, though aside from [[Columbiana County, Ohio]], the Youngstown [[Designated market area#Television|DMA]] isn't traditionally or culturally considered part of the region.<ref>[http://metromonthly.wordpress.com/2007/09/01/youngstown-appalachia/ Youngstown, Appalachia? \u2013 Metro Monthly].

With the exception of the October 1, 1940, opening of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], the region's mountainous terrain continuously thwarted major federal intervention attempts at major road construction until the 1970s. This left large parts of the region virtually isolated and slowing economic growth. Before the Civil War, major cities in the region were connected via wagon roads to lowland areas, and [[flatboat]]s provided an important means for transporting goods out of the region. By 1900, railroads connected most of the region with the rest of the nation, although the poor roads made travel beyond railroad hubs difficult. When the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in 1965, road construction was considered its most important initiative, and in subsequent decades the commission spent more on road construction than all other projects combined.<ref name=transeoa>Burton, Mark, and Richard Hatcher, Introduction to Transportation section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 685\u201390.</ref>\n\nThe effort to connect Appalachia with the outside world has required numerous civil engineering feats. Millions of tons of rock were removed to build road segments such as [[Interstate 40]] through the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line and [[U.S. Route 23]] in [[Letcher County, Kentucky]]. Large tunnels were built through mountain slopes at [[Cumberland Gap Tunnel|Cumberland Gap]] to speed up travel along [[U.S. Route 25E]]. The [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in West Virginia, completed in 1977, was the longest and is now the [[List of longest arch bridge spans|fourth-longest single-arch bridge]] in the world.

Built on neighborhood pride, bravery, and sheer boredom, these community guardians were dedicated to their evening walks, using their flashlights to shatter the shadows of hooligans and criminals skittering through the dark corners of North Pershing Drive. Although they strived for safety and professionalism, this motley crew of vigilantes was not initially met with acceptance.\n\nBy mid-summer 2009 the Lyon Park Night Watch, as they self-deputized themselves, was constantly beaten down at local community meetings. \"All I can hear at night is the ice in their cups rattling,\" one disgruntled neighbor cried at the infamous July 24th meeting. As the ungrateful community members locked horns on how to officially disband the Night Watch, its founding members were out catching a band of local youths in the midst of the horrific act of hurling tissue paper atop the oldest oak in the neighborhood. \n\nAfter that night, no youth dared purchase a roll of any kind, whether it be toilet paper, jelly, or dinner. Henceforth, the Lyon Park Night Watch was official--supported not only by the mothers and fathers that wanted to keep their children safe, but also by the fear of all crooks and convicts in the 5-mile radius. \n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commonscat|Lyon Park Historic District}}\n\n{{Arlington County, Virginia}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Virginia}}\n\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Queen Anne architecture in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arlington County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Houses in Arlington County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ArlingtonCountyVA-NRHP-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Lyon Park Historic District\n  | nrhp_type = hd  | nocat = yes  \n  | designated_other1 = Virginia Landmarks Register\n  | designated_other1_date = May 19, 2003, March 10, 2008<ref name=\"VLR list\">{{cite web|title=Virginia Landmarks Register|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/register_counties_cities.htm|accessdate=2013-05-12}}</ref>\n  | designated_other1_number = 000-7820\n  | designated_other1_num_position = bottom\n  | image = Lyon Park Historic District 01.JPG\n  | caption = \n  | location= Roughly bounded by 10th St. N, Arlington Blvd., and N.

It is located in the east of the historic [[Zollfeld]] plain (''Gosposvetsko polje''), the wide valley of the [[Glan (Gurk)|Glan]] river. The municipality includes the [[Katastralgemeinden|cadastral communes]] of Kading, Karnburg, M\u00f6derndorf, Possau and St. Michael am Zollfeld.\n\n==History==\nThe Zollfeld valley has been a cultural and political centre since [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes settled in the region. When their kingdom of [[Noricum]] had become a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 15 BC, Emperor [[Claudius]] had the city of [[Virunum]] erected as the province's capital at the foot of the nearby [[Magdalensberg]], where on the hill top a splendid Celtic settlement had already existed. Virunum  became a centre of [[early Christianity]] in the early 4th century as the [[Episcopal see|see]] of a bishop under the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarch of Aquileia]].\n[[File:Valvasor MARIA SAAL 1680 Kupferstich.jpg|thumb|left|Maria Saal with [[Duke's Chair]], engraving by [[Johann Weikhard von Valvasor]], 1680]]\nWhen pagan [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic tribes]] entered the region around 590, they settled in a place called Krnski Grad (German: Karnburg), close to Virunum, which became the administrative centre of their [[Carantania]] principality. Here the ritual of installing the [[prince]]s took place on the [[Prince's Stone]], the base of an ancient Roman [[Ionic order|Ionic]] column originating from Virunum. The ceremony was continued in the local dialect of the Slovene language long into the Middle Ages. After Duke [[Odilo, Duke of Bavaria|Odilo of Bavaria]] about 743 had vassalised the Carantanian prince Borut, the ritual was supplemented by a German-language ceremony at the [[Duke's Chair]], a double throne made of stone, which can still be seen near Maria Saal.\n\nThe second [[Christianization]] of the area began at about 767 under Bishop [[Vergilius of Salzburg]]. His missionary [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]] had the first church of the [[Assumption of Mary]] built at Maria Saal/Gospa Sveta, across the plain from Krnski Grad/Karnburg, as the centre of his missionary activities. ''S. Maria ad Carantanum'' was first mentioned in an 860 deed, probably a smallish wooden church that has vanished long since. From this bishop's church - by no means a cathedral in the modern sense of the word - [[Christianity]] was spread all over Carantania.\n\nAfter [[Charlemagne]] had finally deposed the Bavarian duke [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|Tassilo III]] in 787, Karnburg remained the political capital when Carantania became a [[march (territory)|march]] of the [[Francia|Frankish realm]]. The [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] (\u2020 899), probably born in nearby [[Moosburg, Austria|Moosburg]], built a ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' here. In 893 he appointed the Bavarian count [[Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria|Luitpold]] Margrave in the [[March of Carinthia]], his [[Luitpoldings|Luitpolding]] descendants also ruled as [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Bavarian dukes]].\n\nWhen Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] deposed Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry II the Quarrelsome]] and finally separated Carinthia from [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in 976, Karnburg also was the political centre of the [[Duchy of Carinthia|duchy]], a function that later was taken over by the ducal town of [[Sankt Veit an der Glan]], a few miles to the north, and finally in the 16th century by the City of [[Klagenfurt]] to the south.\n[[File:Maria Saal Kapuzinerstoeckl Dom und Dechantei W-Ansicht 03072017 0083.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Church]]\n\n==Church==\nMaria Saal is famous for its large [[pilgrimage]] church in seemingly transitional style from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. Not much remains from the Romanesque church that had replaced the bishop's church of Modestus and his successors. The present fortified church building goes back to the mid-15th century and is in high Gothic style, actually  reconstructed within 20 years  after the big fire of 1669.\n\nIn view of the church's predecessor, which, as the church of Bishop Modestus, was the religious center of Carinthia in the 8th century and practically an [[episcopal see]] until 945, the present church is popularly still called a \"Dom\", i.e. \"[[cathedral]]\", which it, of course, has never been. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sarcophagus  beneath the church is said to contain the remains of Modestus.

It is located in the east of the historic [[Zollfeld]] plain (''Gosposvetsko polje''), the wide valley of the [[Glan (Gurk)|Glan]] river. The municipality includes the [[Katastralgemeinden|cadastral communes]] of Kading, Karnburg, M\u00f6derndorf, Possau and St. Michael am Zollfeld.\n\n==History==\nThe Zollfeld valley has been a cultural and political centre since [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes settled in the region. When their kingdom of [[Noricum]] had become a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 15 BC, Emperor [[Claudius]] had the city of [[Virunum]] erected as the province's capital at the foot of the nearby [[Magdalensberg]], where on the hill top a splendid Celtic settlement had already existed. Virunum  became a centre of [[Early Christianity]] in the early 4th century as the [[Episcopal see|see]] of a bishop under the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarch of Aquileia]].\n[[File:Valvasor MARIA SAAL 1680 Kupferstich.jpg|thumb|left|Maria Saal with [[Duke's Chair]], engraving by [[Johann Weikhard von Valvasor]], 1680]]\nWhen pagan [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic tribes]] entered the region around 590, they settled in a place called Krnski Grad (German: Karnburg), close to Virunum, which became the administrative centre of their [[Carantania]] principality. Here the ritual of installing the [[prince]]s took place on the [[Prince's Stone]], the base of an ancient Roman [[Ionic order|Ionic]] column originating from Virunum. The ceremony was continued in the local dialect of the Slovene language long into the Middle Ages. After Duke [[Odilo, Duke of Bavaria|Odilo of Bavaria]] about 743 had vassalised the Carantanian prince Borut, the ritual was supplemented by a German-language ceremony at the [[Duke's Chair]], a double throne made of stone, which can still be seen near Maria Saal.\n\nThe second [[Christianization]] of the area began at about 767 under Bishop [[Vergilius of Salzburg]]. His missionary [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]] had the first church of the [[Assumption of Mary]] built at Maria Saal/Gospa Sveta, across the plain from Krnski Grad/Karnburg, as the centre of his missionary activities. ''S. Maria ad Carantanum'' was first mentioned in an 860 deed, probably a smallish wooden church that has vanished long since. From this bishop's church - by no means a cathedral in the modern sense of the word - [[Christianity]] was spread all over Carantania.\n\nAfter [[Charlemagne]] had finally deposed the Bavarian duke [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|Tassilo III]] in 787, Karnburg remained the political capital when Carantania became a [[march (territory)|march]] of the [[Francia|Frankish realm]]. The [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] (\u2020 899), probably born in nearby [[Moosburg, Austria|Moosburg]], built a ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' here. In 893 he appointed the Bavarian count [[Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria|Luitpold]] Margrave in the [[March of Carinthia]], his [[Luitpoldings|Luitpolding]] descendants also ruled as [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Bavarian dukes]].\n\nWhen Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] deposed Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry II the Quarrelsome]] and finally separated Carinthia from [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in 976, Karnburg also was the political centre of the [[Duchy of Carinthia|duchy]], a function that later was taken over by the ducal town of [[Sankt Veit an der Glan]], a few miles to the north, and finally in the 16th century by the City of [[Klagenfurt]] to the south.\n[[File:Maria Saal Kapuzinerstoeckl Dom und Dechantei W-Ansicht 03072017 0083.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Church]]\n\n==Church==\nMaria Saal is famous for its large [[pilgrimage]] church in seemingly transitional style from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. Not much remains from the Romanesque church that had replaced the bishop's church of Modestus and his successors. The present fortified church building goes back to the mid-15th century and is in high Gothic style, actually  reconstructed within 20 years  after the big fire of 1669.\n\nIn view of the church's predecessor, which, as the church of Bishop Modestus, was the religious center of Carinthia in the 8th century and practically an [[episcopal see]] until 945, the present church is popularly still called a \"Dom\", i.e. \"[[cathedral]]\", which it, of course, has never been. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sarcophagus  beneath the church is said to contain the remains of Modestus. Still today, however, it is a major [[pilgrimage]] site for both German- and Slovene-speaking Carinthians and even for Slovene nationals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Church Bells===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # !!

Marianne often waxes poetic about cosmology, quantum mechanics, string theory and the belief that there are multiple universes that pull people's lives in various directions. This is reflected in the play's structure as brief scenes are repeated, often with different outcomes. \n\nRoland and Marianne meet at a barbecue and become romantically involved. After they've moved in together, a confession of infidelity causes them to break up. After some time, they run in to each other at a ballroom dancing class, resume their relationship, and eventually marry. Marianne begins to forget words and has trouble typing. She is told by her doctor that she has a tumor in her frontal lobe and has less than a year to live. She eventually seeks [[assisted suicide]] abroad with Roland's support. The play ends with a flashback to the scene where Roland and Marianne rekindle their relationship in the dance class.\n\n==Publication==\nSeveral versions of the play have been published in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=Constellations.

Because of the show's success, the actress Wang Xiaohuan is noted by ''[[The Beijing News]]'' as The Young Theater Artist of the Year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/beijing/2015-11/06/content_22390752.htm|title=Play of scenarios in love seeks to bemuse Beijing[1]|last=\u80e1\u54f2|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\nin 2018 the work premiered in Lima Peru, from January to March, under the direction of Rodrigo Falla, and with the performances of Jesus Neyra and Gisela Ponce De Le\u00f3n.\nThe work was a resounding success in Lima, having good reviews, was so successful then it was presented in the province of Tacna and in the plazuelas de las artes of the municipality of Lima (Place where the best works of Peru are presented free of charge financed by the municipality).\n\n==Plot Summary==\nThe play follows Roland, a beekeeper, and Marianne, a cosmologist through their romantic relationship. Marianne often waxes poetic about cosmology, quantum mechanics, string theory and the belief that there are multiple universes that pull people's lives in various directions. This is reflected in the play's structure as brief scenes are repeated, often with different outcomes. \n\nRoland and Marianne meet at a barbecue and become romantically involved. After they've moved in together, a confession of infidelity causes them to break up. After some time, they run in to each other at a ballroom dancing class, resume their relationship, and eventually marry. Marianne begins to forget words and has trouble typing. She is told by her doctor that she has a tumor in her frontal lobe and has less than a year to live. She eventually seeks [[assisted suicide]] abroad with Roland's support. The play ends with a flashback to the scene where Roland and Marianne rekindle their relationship in the dance class.\n\n==Publication==\nSeveral versions of the play have been published in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=Constellations.
