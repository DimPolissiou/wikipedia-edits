The '''Digital Phone Group''' (\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30db\u30f3, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and '''J-PHONE Co., Ltd.''' (J-\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3) was formed in 1999 by the merging of DGP with Digital TU-KA Group (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused with [[KDDI|TU-KA]]). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%.\n\nJ-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by continuously introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker for [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], SkyMelody ringtone download, the famous [[Sha-Mail]] picture mail introduced on the basis of [[camera phones]] developed by [[Sharp Corporation|SHARP]], the mobile multimedia data service [[J-Sky]] modeled after [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]], and advanced [[Java platform|Java]] services based on [[JSCL]], modeled after NTT DoCoMo's [[DoJa]] based i-appli.\n\n===Vodafone===\nIn October 2001, the British mobile phone group [[Vodafone]] increased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On 1 October 2003, the name of the company and the service brand was officially changed to Vodafone, with the division called '''Vodafone [[Kabushiki gaisha|K.K.]]''' or '''Vodafone Japan'''. The growth and success of the company during this period is due in large part to then-president [[Bill Morrow (executive)|Bill Morrow]].<ref name=\"Bill Morrow Article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/18440.php |title=Bill Morrow, Vodafone's turnaround guru, Walks Away|publisher=Cellular-news.com|date=24 June 2006|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, [[au by KDDI]] gained 163,700, and [[Willcom]] gained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo's [[FOMA]] 3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone cut back investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers, and by end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen by 103,100 to 14.996 million, while during the same period NTT DoCoMo had gained 1.65 million customers and KDDI/AU had gained 1.82 million customers. At the end of October 2005, NTT DoCoMo had 17.6 million 3G customers, KDDI/AU had 19.8 million 3G customers, and Vodafone-Japan had 1.9 million 3G customers, i.e. Vodafone-Japan gained about 4.8% of Japan's 3G market.\n\nVodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky to [[Vodafone live!]], and used J-Sky's principles and technologies and business models to introduce the [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. Thus Vodafone live! has its origin in J-Phone's J-Sky. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000 to 12,769,600.\n\nIn March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers, as Japanese users tend to have preferences not seen in other markets. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and did not have as many features as competing companies. This led to the loss of more customers and Vodafone's decision that the market was no longer profitable.\n\n===SoftBank Mobile===\n[[File:(Real) TV on Mobile (397712891).jpg|thumb|Television broadcast on a 2007 [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] phone on SoftBank]]\n\nOn 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell its holding of Vodafone Japan (Vodafone K.K.) to SoftBank for about 1.75 trillion Japanese yen (about US$15.1 billion).

The '''Digital Phone Group''' (\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30db\u30f3, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and '''J-PHONE Co., Ltd.''' (J-\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3) was formed in 1999 by the merging of DGP with Digital TU-KA Group (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused with [[KDDI|TU-KA]]). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%.\n\nJ-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by continuously introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker for [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], SkyMelody ringtone download, the famous [[Sha-Mail]] picture mail introduced on the basis of [[camera phones]] developed by [[Sharp Corporation|SHARP]], the mobile multimedia data service [[J-Sky]] modeled after [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]], and advanced [[Java platform|Java]] services based on [[JSCL]], modeled after NTT DoCoMo's [[DoJa]] based i-appli.\n\n===Vodafone===\nIn October 2001, the British mobile phone group [[Vodafone]] increased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On 1 October 2003, the name of the company and the service brand was officially changed to Vodafone, with the division called '''Vodafone [[Kabushiki gaisha|K.K.]]''' or '''Vodafone Japan'''. The growth and success of the company during this period is due in large part to then-president [[Bill Morrow (executive)|Bill Morrow]].<ref name=\"Bill Morrow Article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/18440.php |title=Bill Morrow, Vodafone's turnaround guru, Walks Away|publisher=Cellular-news.com|date=24 June 2006|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, [[au by KDDI]] gained 163,700, and [[Willcom]] gained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo's [[FOMA]] 3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone cut back investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers, and by end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen by 103,100 to 14.996 million, while during the same period NTT DoCoMo had gained 1.65 million customers and KDDI/AU had gained 1.82 million customers. At the end of October 2005, NTT DoCoMo had 17.6 million 3G customers, KDDI/AU had 19.8 million 3G customers, and Vodafone-Japan had 1.9 million 3G customers, i.e. Vodafone-Japan gained about 4.8% of Japan's 3G market.\n\nVodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky to [[Vodafone live!]], and used J-Sky's principles and technologies and business models to introduce the [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. Thus Vodafone live! has its origin in J-Phone's J-Sky. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000 to 12,769,600.\n\nIn March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers, as Japanese users tend to have preferences not seen in other markets. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and did not have as many features as competing companies. This led to the loss of more customers and Vodafone's decision that the market was no longer profitable.\n\n===SoftBank Mobile===\n[[File:(Real) TV on Mobile (397712891).jpg|thumb|Television broadcast on a 2007 [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] phone on SoftBank]]\n\nOn 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell its holding of Vodafone Japan (Vodafone K.K.) to SoftBank for about 1.75 trillion Japanese yen (about US$15.1 billion).
