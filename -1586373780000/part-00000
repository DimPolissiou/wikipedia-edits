At the time of his son's birth Sir Anthony was Attorney General of the [[Cape Colony]], but he was soon appointed [[Chief Justice]] in [[Ceylon]]. Laurence spent his early childhood in [[Colombo]], where his father purchased a home called Alcove in Captains Gardens, subsequently known as [[Maha Nuge Gardens]]. Sir Anthony and his son have been credited with bringing [[tea]] to Ceylon and growing 30 tea plants brought over from [[China]] on the Oliphant Estate in [[Nuwara Eliya]].<ref name=\"tea\">{{cite web |title=Reference to Sir Anthony Oliphant and the introduction of Tea to Ceylon|url=http://artandtea.wordpress.com/|accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref> In 1848 and 1849, he and his parents toured Europe. In 1851, he accompanied [[Jung Bahadur]] from [[Colombo]] to [[Nepal]], which provided the material for his first book, ''A Journey to Katmandu'' (1852).\nOliphant returned to Ceylon and from there went to England to study law. Oliphant left his legal studies to travel in [[Russia]]. The outcome of that tour was his book ''The Russian Shores of the Black Sea'' (1853).\n\nOliphant's parents were [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]].<ref name=\"peslo\"/>\n\n==Diplomatic and utopian pursuits==\nBetween 1853 and 1861 Oliphant was secretary to [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] during the negotiation of the Canada Reciprocity Treaty in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and companion to the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] on a visit to the [[Circassia]]n coast during the [[Crimean War]].\n\n[[File:BritishLegationAttack1861.jpg|thumb|right|Attack of the British legation in [[T\u014dzen-ji]], [[Edo]], in 1861]]\n\nIn 1861, Oliphant was appointed First Secretary of the British Legation in Japan under Minister Plenipotentiary (later Sir) [[Rutherford Alcock]]. He arrived in [[Edo]] at the end of June, but on the evening of 5 July, a night-time attack was made on the legation by xenophobic [[ronin]]. His [[pistol]]s having been locked in their travelling box, Oliphant rushed out with a [[crop (implement)|hunting whip]], and was attacked by a ronin with a [[katana|heavy two-handed sword]]. A beam, invisible in the darkness, interfered with the blows, but Oliphant was severely wounded and sent on board ship to recover. He had to return to England after a visit to [[Tsushima Island]], where he discovered a Russian force occupying a secluded bay and obtained its withdrawal. The attack on the legation left him with permanent damage to one of his hands.\n\nHe was sent to Poland in 1863 as a British observer to report on the [[January Uprising]].<ref name=\"peslo\"/>\n\nOliphant returned to England, resigned from the Diplomatic Service and was elected to Parliament in 1865 for [[Stirling Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling Burghs]]. While he did not show any conspicuous parliamentary ability, he was made a great success by his novel ''Piccadilly'' (1870). He then fell under the influence of the spiritualist prophet [[Thomas Lake Harris]], who, in about 1861, had organised a small community, the Brotherhood of the New Life, which was settled in [[Brocton, New York]], on [[Lake Erie]], and he subsequently moved to [[Santa Rosa, California]].\n\nAfter having been refused permission to join Harris in 1867, he was eventually allowed to join his community, and Oliphant caused a scandal by leaving Parliament in 1868 to follow Harris to Brocton.<ref name=\"peslo\"/> He lived there for several years engaged in what Harris termed the 'Use', manual labour aimed at forwarding his utopian vision. Members of the community were allowed to return to the outside world from time to time to earn money for the community. After three years, Oliphant worked as correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' during the [[Franco-German War]], and afterwards spent several years in Paris in the service of the paper. There he met, through his mother, his future wife, Alice le Strange. They married at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 8 June 1872.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Anne Taylor (1982).

He was an early participant in the [[Home Rule]] movement, led by [[Isaac Butt]], and played a leading role in forming [[Irish Nationalist]] thinking on the over-taxation of Ireland.  He was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] in 1867, and was a magistrate and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for [[County Cork]] and a magistrate in [[County Waterford]].\n\nA Catholic,<ref>See e.g. ''Freeman\u2019s Journal'', 16 August 1906</ref> he was born in [[Dublin]], the son of Michael McKenna, and educated at [[Trinity College Dublin]].  In 1842 he married Esther Louise Howe of Dublin, and after her death married Amelia, widow of R. W. Hole.  He was called to the [[King's Inns|Irish bar]] in 1849.<ref>''Who Was Who'' has 1849. ''The Times'' has 1849 in the obituary dated 17 August 1906 but 1848 in the candidate biography of 27 November 1885.</ref>  He was an able financier, was chairman of the [[National Irish Bank|National Bank of Ireland]] and became wealthy.\n\nHe entered Parliament as member for [[Youghal (UK Parliament constituency)|Youghal]], Co. Cork, at the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1865]], defeating the incumbent [[Isaac Butt]], the later Home Rule leader, by 122 to 30 votes, the electorate being a tiny 237. Both stood as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. McKenna lost the seat to [[Christopher Weguelin]], also a Liberal, in [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868]] by 127 votes to 106, and accepted defeat although Weguelin's election was declared void on account of bribery (which was a viable tactic with such a small electorate).\n\nMcKenna joined the [[Home Government Association]] in September 1873. He attended the founding conference of the [[Home Rule League]] in Dublin on 18\u201321 November 1873 and moved one of the resolutions. In 1874 McKenna stood as a Home Rule candidate at Youghal and regained the seat.  He also defeated a renewed Conservative challenge in 1880.\n\nMcKenna worked closely with [[Isaac Butt]] and took part in parliamentary [[Obstructionism|obstruction]] with the more radical Irish members including [[Joseph Gillis Biggar|Joseph Biggar]]. But in the vital vote of 17 May 1880 in which Parnell displaced [[William Shaw (Irish politician)|William Shaw]] as chairman of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], McKenna voted for Shaw.\n\nThe [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]] was fought on new boundaries with a greatly enlarged electorate.  McKenna had insufficient support to stand in the new [[East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cork constituency]] into which Youghal was absorbed, and moved to [[South Monaghan (UK Parliament constituency)|South Monaghan]], where he defeated a Conservative by nearly five to one in 1885 and a [[Irish Unionist Party|Unionist]] by a similar margin in 1886.\n\nWhen the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell's leadership, McKenna joined the [[Parnellite]] minority which supported Parnell. He was one of only two MPs who had opposed Parnell's takeover in the vote of May 1880 who supported Parnell in the split of 1890, the other being [[Richard Power (Parnellite MP)|Richard Power]].\n\nMcKenna retired at the subsequent [[1892 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1892]], being then well over 70.\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references/>\n\n==Publications==\n* Speech of Joseph Neale McKenna Esq., M.P., to his Constituents at Youghal Court House, 21 September 1866, London, Keating & Co., 1866\n*''Sir J.

A total of 29 athletes, 17 men and 12 women, were selected to the Peruvian squad across eleven sports.<ref name=PER-athletes>{{cite news|first=Jack Dylan|last=Cole|title=Rio 2016: Peru sends most Olympic athletes in history|url=http://perureports.com/2016/08/03/peru-olympics/|publisher=Peru Reports|date=3 August 2016|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=R\u00edo 2016: los 29 peruanos que luchar\u00e1n por una medalla|trans-title=Rio 2016: 29 Peruvians will fight for the medal|language=es|url=http://elcomercio.pe/deporte-total/polideportivo/rio-2016-29-peruanos-que-lucharan-medalla-fotos-noticia-1921312|publisher=[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]]|location=[[Peru]]|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> Among the sporting events represented by the nation's athletes, Peru marked its Olympic debut in artistic gymnastics and women's freestyle wrestling, as well as its return to equestrian for more than three decades.\n\nTrap shooter and 1984 silver medalist [[Francisco Boza]] etched his name into the historic records as the first ever Peruvian to compete in eight Olympic Games. The oldest and the most experienced participant (aged 52), Boza reprised his role to lead the Peruvian team for the third time as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, the previous two doing so in [[Barcelona 1992]] and [[Athens 2004]].<ref name=flag-bearer/> Apart from Boza, seven other athletes were returning Olympians, with only two headed to their third Games, including marathoner [[In\u00e9s Melchor]] and Laser Radial sailor [[Paloma Schmidt]]. 21 Peruvian athletes made their Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro; the most notable were middle-distance runner and dual American citizen [[David Torrence (athlete)|David Torrence]] and gymnast [[Ariana Orrego]], the youngest of the roster (aged 18).<ref name=PER-athletes/><ref>{{cite news|first=Elliot|last=Almond|title=Why Cal\u2019s David Torrence chose to run for Peru at Rio Games|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/28/why-cals-david-torrence-chose-to-run-for-peru-at-rio-games/|publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=28 July 2016|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nPeru, however, failed to win a single medal in Rio de Janeiro, continuing a drought that began at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, where shooter [[Juan Giha]] took the silver in the mixed skeet. Peru's most successful outcome at these Games occurred in taekwondo, where [[Julissa Diez]] bounced back from her early elimination to finish seventh in the women's 49&nbsp;kg, losing the repechage bout to Thailand's [[Panipak Wongpattanakit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=R\u00edo 2016: Conoce c\u00f3mo les fue a los peruanos en los Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos|trans-title=Rio 2016: Outcomes of the Peruvians

It is administratively part of [[Plovdiv Province]] and has a population of about 30,340 ({{As of|2017|lc=on}}), the mayor being Dr. Emil Kabaivanov.\n\nKarlovo is famous for the worldwide-known [[rose oil]], which is grown there and used in producing perfume. In addition to this, Karlovo is the birthplace of [[Vasil Levski]], the most distinguished Bulgarian to start preparing the national liberation from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in the late 19th century. There is a museum and large monument dedicated to him. Karlovo is also a popular location for tourism in the region.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Bulgarian archaeologists made discoveries in Central Bulgaria which were summarized as 'The Valley of the [[Thracians|Thracian]] Kings'. On 19 August 2005, some archaeologists announced they had found the first Thracian capital, which was situated near Karlovo in Bulgaria. A lot of polished ceramic artifacts (pieces of roof-tiles and Greek-like vases) were discovered revealing the fortune of the town. The Bulgarian Ministry of Culture declared its support to the excavations.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kurshum-Mosque-Karlovo.jpg|thumb|[[Kursum Mosque, Karlovo|Kursum Mosque]], built at the beginning of the 15th century]]\nKarlovo is a successor of the medieval fortress of '''Kopsis''' (\u041a\u043e\u043f\u0441\u0438\u0441 in Bulgarian, K\u03c9\u03c8\u03af\u03c2 or \u039a\u03cc\u03c8\u03b7 in [[Byzantine Greek]]), a feudal possession of [[Smilets of Bulgaria]] in the 13th-14th century and the likely capital of his brother ''[[despotes|despot\u0113s]]'' Voysil's short-lived realm. The modern town originated in 1483 at the place of the village of Sushitsa (still today Sushitsa is one of Karlovo's districts), but grew in importance in the 19th century as a centre of Bulgarian culture and revolutionary activity. In 1876 [[Lady Strangford]] arrived from Britain with relief for the people of Bulgaria following the massacres that followed the [[April Uprising]]. She built a hospital at [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]] and eventually other hospitals were built at [[Radilovo]], [[Panagiurishte]], [[Perushtitsa]], [[Petrich]] and here at Karlovo.<ref name=shurb>{{cite book|last1=Shurbanov|first1=Alexander|title=Victorian England ~ Literary Perspective in Bulgaria|date=1996|location=Sofia|url=https://archive.org/stream/VictorianEnglandLiteraryPerspectiveInBulgaria/bulgaria_victorian-literature_djvu.txt}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1953 until 1962, the town was called ''Levskigrad''.\n\n==Geography==\nKarlovo lies at {{coord|42|38|N|24|48|E}}, {{convert|386|m|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

According to the will of Kirko Bouhalov\u2019s daughter, Penka Popova, the building was donated to the town in 1937. During the 1970s, the building was transformed into a students\u2019 hostel but, due to its poor condition, the town authorities closed it. For 20 years the Bouhalov Han (Inn) had been staying lifeless and slowly turning to ruins, thus taking away part of the Revival Period history of that town. The building is now a [[Handicraft]]s\u2019 Centre, since Karlovo has preserved alive even today the traditional handicrafts, such as: [[Goldsmith]]\u2019s and [[Coppersmith]]\u2019s trade, carpet industry, [[Pottery]], woolen braiding manufacturing, [[Wood carving]], cooperage, [[Engraving]], icon-painting ([[Iconography]]), [[Kalofer]] lace and many others.\n\n===Other===\n*'''The [[Vasil Levski]] Monument.'''

It is administratively part of [[Plovdiv Province]] and has a population of about 30,340 ({{As of|2017|lc=on}}), the mayor being Dr. Emil Kabaivanov.\n\nKarlovo is famous for the worldwide-known [[rose oil]], which is grown there and used in producing perfume. In addition to this, Karlovo is the birthplace of [[Vasil Levski]], the most distinguished Bulgarian to start preparing the national liberation from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in the late 19th century. There is a museum and large monument dedicated to him. Karlovo is also a popular location for tourism in the region.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Bulgarian archaeologists made discoveries in Central Bulgaria which were summarized as 'The Valley of the [[Thracians|Thracian]] Kings'. On 19 August 2005, some archaeologists announced they had found the first Thracian capital, which was situated near Karlovo in Bulgaria. A lot of polished ceramic artifacts (pieces of roof-tiles and Greek-like vases) were discovered revealing the fortune of the town.

The modern town originated in 1483 at the place of the village of Sushitsa (still today Sushitsa is one of Karlovo's districts), but grew in importance in the 19th century as a centre of Bulgarian culture and revolutionary activity. In 1876 [[Lady Strangford]] arrived from Britain with relief for the people of Bulgaria following the massacres that followed the [[April Uprising]]. She built a hospital at [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]] and eventually other hospitals were built at [[Radilovo]], [[Panagiurishte]], [[Perushtitsa]], [[Petrich]] and here at Karlovo.<ref name=shurb>{{cite book|last1=Shurbanov|first1=Alexander|title=Victorian England ~ Literary Perspective in Bulgaria|date=1996|location=Sofia|url=https://archive.org/stream/VictorianEnglandLiteraryPerspectiveInBulgaria/bulgaria_victorian-literature_djvu.txt}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1953 until 1962, the town was called ''Levskigrad''.\n\n==Geography==\nKarlovo lies at {{coord|42|38|N|24|48|E}}, {{convert|386|m|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

According to the will of Kirko Bouhalov\u2019s daughter, Penka Popova, the building was donated to the town in 1937. During the 1970s, the building was transformed into a students\u2019 hostel but, due to its poor condition, the town authorities closed it. For 20 years the Bouhalov Han (Inn) had been staying lifeless and slowly turning to ruins, thus taking away part of the Revival Period history of that town. The building is now a [[Handicraft]]s\u2019 Centre, since Karlovo has preserved alive even today the traditional handicrafts, such as: [[Goldsmith]]\u2019s and [[Coppersmith]]\u2019s trade, carpet industry, [[Pottery]], woolen braiding manufacturing, [[Wood carving]], cooperage, [[Engraving]], icon-painting ([[Iconography]]), [[Kalofer]] lace and many others.\n\n===Other===\n*'''The [[Vasil Levski]] Monument.'''

Henniker-Major, 5th Baron Henniker''' [[Volunteer Officers Decoration|VD]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]]  (7 November 1842 \u2013 27 June 1902), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Peerage|peer]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician.\n\n==Background and education==\nHenniker was the son of [[John Henniker-Major, 4th Baron Henniker]],<ref name=peerage>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p27541.htm The Peerage.com]</ref> and was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{acad|id=HNKR860JM|name=Henniker-Major, the

He held the seat until 1870, when he succeeded his father as fifth Baron Henniker and second Baron Hartismere. The latter title had been granted to his father in 1866, and gave him a seat in the [[House of Lords]] (in contrast to the barony of Henniker which was in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]). In 1877 Henniker was appointed a [[Lord-in-waiting]] (government whip in the House of Lords) in the Conservative government of [[Benjamin Disraeli]], a post he held until the government fell in 1880, and again under [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] between 1885 and 1886, between 1886 and 1892, and briefly in 1895. He was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man]] in 1895, serving as such until his death in 1902.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Isle_of_Man.htm World Statesmen]</ref>\n\nLord Henniker was for many years chairman of the [[quarter session]]s and of the county council for East Suffolk.
