It produces egg-shaped tuberous roots {{convert|2|cm|inch}} to {{convert|8|cm|inch}} long at the end of fibrous roots. The leaves are large, up to {{convert|60|cm|inch}} long and {{convert|20|cm|inch}} wide.  [[Indigenous people of the Americas]] have used the durable leaves to make traditional medicines and as baby clothing. Leren usually reproduces itself through [[rhizomes]] which produce shoots and new plants.<ref>FAO, p. 240</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\nLeren is adapted to a tropical climate with alternating rainy and dry seasons.  It sprouts with the first rains and grows rapidly, forming tubers which are harvested as the foliage begins to die back eight or nine months after the initial sprouting.  The rhizomes, harvested at the same time, are tolerant of both drying and flooding, and divided and replanted again at the onset of the rainy season.  Frequent irrigation is necessary during dry periods.  Leren is often planted in shade or partial shade but can grow in full sun with adequate moisture and nutrients.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 252-252</ref>\n\nLeren is traditionally cultivated on a small scale.  Its cultivation is declining as it has been replaced by other crops.<ref>FAO, p. 239</ref>\n\n==Food==\nLeren is usually cooked by boiling the tubers for 15 to 60 minutes,  As food, leren is often compared to water chestnut ([[Eleocharis dulcis]]) because leren, like the water chestnut, retains its crispness despite being cooked. Boiled leren has a taste similar to [[sweet corn]], hence one of its common English names. The cooked tuber is covered with a thin, edible skin which is most easily peeled after cooking. Leren is mostly eaten as an [[hors d'oeuvre]] or appetizer. Leren tubers can be stored at room temperatures for up to three months, but do not tolerate refrigeration well.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 254-256</ref>\n\nThe nutritional value of leren has not been thoroughly studied, but the tubers have a starch content of 13-15 percent and a protein content of 6.6 percent.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, p. 254</ref>\n\n==Prehistoric domestication==\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have discovered that leren was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Leren, along with arrowroot (''[[Maranta arundinacea]]''), [[squash (plant)|squash]] (''[[Cucurbita moschata]]''), and bottle gourd (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'') were being cultivated in northern South American and Panama between 8200 BCE and 5600 BCE.<ref>Piperno, Dolores R. (Oct 2011), \"The Origins of Plant Cultivation and Domestication in the New World Tropics\", ''Current Anthropology'', Vol 52, No. 54, p. S 459.

For example, the people of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas culture]] on the arid and semi-arid [[Santa Elena Peninsula]] of [[Ecuador]] grew leren by about 7000 BCE. Leren was being grown there to be eaten raw, dried, or ground into flour.<ref>Moore, Jerry D. (2014), ''A Prehistory of South America'', Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 97-99.
