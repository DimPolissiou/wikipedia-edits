He is the [[Archdeacon]] of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].\n\n==In the novel==\n[[Dom (title)|Dom]] Claude Frollo is a pious and highly knowledgeable man who was orphaned along with his younger brother Jehan when their parents died of [[black plague|the plague]]. His studies led him to become the Archdeacon of Josas, which is his position during the events of the novel. He also has a small [[fiefdom|fief]] which brings him a little money, most of which goes to fund his brother's [[alcoholism]].\n\nDuring a holiday at Notre Dame called [[Quasimodo Sunday]], he rescues a deformed [[hunchback]] child whom he finds abandoned on the cathedral's [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] bed. He adopts the boy, names him \"[[Quasimodo]]\" after the holiday, raises him like a son, and teaches him a sort of sign language when Quasimodo is deafened by the cathedral\u2019s bells. Frollo is a respected scholar and studies several languages, law, medicine, science and theology. However, he becomes infatuated with [[alchemy]], which leads townspeople to spread the rumor that he is a [[wikt:sorcerer|sorcerer]]. He also believes strongly in [[Fatalism|fate]]. All this, along with his extreme and [[Gynophobia|irrational fear of women]], contribute further to his isolation from society.\n\nFrollo also has strong passions, even though he is a [[Celibacy|celibate]] due to his station within the church. These passions erupt in him through his contact with the beautiful [[gypsy]] girl [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esm\u00e9ralda]], and eventually, they prove his undoing. He considers her to be a temptation sent by [[the Devil]] to test his faith, and curses her as a demon. He finds that he cannot resist her, however, and determines to give in to temptation. Esmeralda, however, is repulsed by his advances. Frollo orders Quasimodo to abduct her, and then abandons him when the hunchback is suddenly captured by [[Captain Phoebus|Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers]] and his guards. Frollo even ignores Quasimodo when he sees him being publicly humiliated for the crime. When Frollo discovers that Esmeralda is in love with Phoebus, he spies on the meeting between them which Esmeralda has arranged \u2013 with Phoebus' consent, as Phoebus only wants one night of passion.  As Phoebus and Esmeralda are about to make love, Frollo, in a jealous rage, stabs Phoebus, and kisses Esmeralda when she faints before fleeing.\n\nFrollo does not attempt to intercede when Esmeralda is turned over to the magistrate on charges of [[witchcraft]] and attempted murder, but he stabs himself during her torture and shows her the wound as a proof of his lust for her. She is unmoved, however, as she is still in love with Phoebus. Shortly before the day she is to be executed, Frollo leaves Paris in a feverish madness, not realizing that Quasimodo \u2013 who is in love with her \u2013 has rescued her from the gallows. When he returns to the news that Esmeralda is still alive, he becomes as jealous of Quasimodo as he was of Phoebus. Frollo later attempts to [[rape]] her at her sanctuary in the cathedral, but Quasimodo \u2013 who doesn't realize who Esmeralda's attacker is at first \u2013 comes to the girl's defense and beats him up. Angered and humiliated, Frollo decides to rid himself of Esmeralda by handing her over to the authorities.\n\nFrollo's time comes when a group of scoundrels, enraged by news that the French monarchy has ordered Esmeralda to be taken from the cathedral and hanged within three days, arms themselves to assault Notre Dame Cathedral. While Quasimodo is busy fighting off the scoundrels, [[Pierre Gringoire]], Esmeralda's husband \u2013 whom she only married to save his life \u2013 and a hooded figure sneak into the Cathedral and convince Esmeralda to sneak out with them. The man's face is hidden behind a hood, leaving Esmeralda to guess his identity. They flee to a boat on the [[River Seine]], then separate when they head to shore, with Gringoire taking her goat, Djali, and leaving Esmeralda with the unknown man. The hooded figure drags Esmeralda to a nearby gallows and identifies himself as Frollo by removing his hood.\n\nFrollo issues Esmeralda his final ultimatum: either she must submit to him, or he will hand her over to the authorities. She rejects him, so he leaves her to an [[anchorite|anchoress]] to hold her for the royal soldiers coming to hang her and goes back to Notre Dame Cathedral. He then walks up to one of the cathedral's towers to watch the girl being hanged, unaware that Quasimodo has spotted him and followed him upstairs. He watches calmly while Esmeralda is taken to the gallows.\n\nWhen Quasimodo sees him laughing at Esmeralda's hanging, he becomes enraged and pushes Frollo off the balustrade. A gargoyle stops his fall, and he cries out to Quasimodo for help, but Quasimodo remains silent. Then Frollo falls down off the cathedral, colliding with the roof of a house. He slides down the roof, hits the pavement of the town square and dies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Victor|last=Hugo|authorlink=Victor Hugo|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame.html?id=hZtfvHDFHE4C|title=The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|date=1831|edition=1993|publisher=[[Wordsworth Editions]]|location=Ware, Hertfordshire, England|isbn=978-1853260681|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n[[Victor Hugo]]'s [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|novel]] has been adapted to film on numerous occasions.

He despises Paris\u2019 Gypsy population and desires to wipe out their entire race. Like his original character in Victor Hugo's novel, Frollo lusts after Esmeralda to the point of obsession, and demands her to choose to be his or die. Frollo believes everything he does is in accordance with God's will, despite frequent disagreements with the Archdeacon of Notre Dame.<ref name=\"disneyandsin.weebly\">{{cite web | url=http://disneyandsin.weebly.com/lust.html | title=Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref> While in the novel Frollo genuinely cares for Quasimodo, in this film he is Quasimodo's reluctant guardian and took him in only out of fear of God\u2019s punishment and the hope that the hunchback will someday be useful to him. Trousdale described the film's Frollo as \"a horrible, horrible person\", while Jay compared him to [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref name=fictionmachine/>\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Frollo and his soldiers capture a group of [[Romani people|Gypsy]] peasants attempting to sneak illegally into Paris on a boat. A Gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo kills her outside [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]]. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's [[archdeacon]] intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. Fearing [[divine retribution]], Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him \"Quasimodo\", and teaching him that the world outside the cathedral is a sinful place full of people who would hate him for his deformity.\n\nTwenty years later, in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]], Frollo appoints a new [[Captain of the Guard]], Phoebus, stating his intent to eradicate the city's Gypsy population by discovering their sanctuary, the \"[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]\". While attending the annual [[Festival of Fools]], Frollo discovers a Gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, who attracts him with her beauty. He finds that Quasimodo has left the bell tower and joined the Festival. Quasimodo is humiliated by the crowd after two of Frollo's guards start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, going so far as to refuse Phoebus' request to stop it, and he is angered when Esmeralda defiantly decides to help Quasimodo. Esmeralda rebukes Frollo before claiming [[sanctuary]] inside the cathedral.\n\nFrollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and begs the [[Virgin Mary]] to save him from her \"[[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\"; he then resolves that \u201cshe will be mine, or she will burn\u201d. When Frollo learns that she has escaped Notre Dame, he instigates a citywide manhunt for her, even going as far as capturing and bribing Gypsies and [[Arson|burning]] countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's actions and openly defies him, and Frollo sentences him to death. While fleeing on Frollo's horse, Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the [[River Seine]], but Esmeralda rescues him just in time and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge.\n\nFrollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo had helped Esmeralda escape. He lies to Quasimodo, saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn with 1,000 men. Following Quasimodo and Phoebus to the Court of Miracles, Frollo and his men capture all the Gypsies present. Frollo prepares to [[Death by burning|burn Esmeralda at the stake]], but offers to spare her life if she submits to his desires. A disgusted Esmeralda refuses and spits on his face, and Frollo prepares to execute her. Quasimodo rescues her, however, and brings her to the cathedral. Frollo orders his soldiers to attack and seize the cathedral. Phoebus releases the Gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men. Quasimodo pours molten lead onto the streets to ensure that no one enters, but Frollo manages to get inside. Frollo attempts to kill Quasimodo, but Quasimodo overpowers him, and openly rejects everything that Frollo raised him to believe. Frollo pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony, where he taunts Quasimodo with the truth about his mother. Frollo knocks Quasimodo over the edge, but Quasimodo manages to hold on and ends up pulling Frollo along with him. Frollo climbs onto a gargoyle and raises his sword to strike at Esmeralda, but the gargoyle crumbles underneath him, causing him to lose his balance. In a vision, Frollo sees the gargoyle's face transform into that of [[Satan]]. Terrified, Frollo screams as the gargoyle breaks off entirely, sending him falling to his death into the molten lead below.\n\n===Later appearances===\n* Frollo appears in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] night-time show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', called on by the [[Queen (Snow White)#Disney version|Evil Queen]] to fight [[Mickey Mouse]]. He is destroyed along with the other villains in the show's conclusion. Frollo made appearances at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the daily Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade. In 2009, the parade moved to the [[Walt Disney Studios Park|Walt Disney Studios]] park at [[Disneyland Resort Paris]] and it is uncertain if Frollo will appear in this version, renamed Stars'n'Cars. Frollo makes a brief cameo appearance during the night-time show [[World of Color|Disney's ''World of Color'']] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]. \"[[Hellfire (song)|Hellfire]]\", the song that Frollo sings in the feature film, is also heard in the show. Frollo also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]].\n* Frollo makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' special ''[[Mickey's House of Villains|House of Villains]]''. He is seen sitting with the [[Mad Hatter]], who makes fun of his bulbous hat. He has no dialogue.\n* Frollo appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', along with a world based on the Disney film called '''La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches'''. He plays out the same role as in the movie, though he is one of the few Disney villains who does not serve as a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle. In the video game, he mistakes Sora for a gypsy, and Riku refers to him as \"a sad old man with a dark heart.\" During the game, while the Sora scenario has Frollo die in the same manner as the movie, the Riku scenario had him fall to his death as a consequence of an updraft called by Wargoyle (whom Frollo refers to it as not a \"demon\", but as \"righteous judgement\", a power granted to him for wiping out the entire gypsy population \"now and forever\"). In ''Dream Drop Distance'', Frollo is voiced by Shouzou Sasaki in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version and by [[Corey Burton]] in the English version.\n* Frollo leads a team of Disney villains in ''The Kingdom Keepers IV: Power Play'' in order to free their leaders, [[Maleficent]] and [[Chernabog]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n* [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda (''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'')]]\n* [[Quasimodo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120815041619/http://www.claudefrollo.com/ Illustration Gallery]\n* Frollo in the [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/frollo/frollo.html Disney Archives-Villains].\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frollo, Claude}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains]]\n[[Category:Fictional alchemists]]\n[[Category:Fictional judges]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors|Claude Frollo#Disney Version|Claude Frollo]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Claude Frollo\n| series             = [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\n| image              = Luc-Olivier Merson - Frollo.jpg\n| caption            = Claude Frollo holding infant [[Quasimodo]] on the steps of Notre Dame in 1480.

These passions erupt in him through his contact with the beautiful [[gypsy]] girl [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esm\u00e9ralda]], and eventually, they prove his undoing. He considers her to be a temptation sent by [[the Devil]] to test his faith, and curses her as a demon. He finds that he cannot resist her, however, and determines to give in to temptation. Esmeralda, however, is repulsed by his advances. Frollo orders Quasimodo to abduct her, and then abandons him when the hunchback is suddenly captured by [[Captain Phoebus|Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers]] and his guards. Frollo even ignores Quasimodo when he sees him being publicly humiliated for the crime. When Frollo discovers that Esmeralda is in love with Phoebus, he spies on the meeting between them which Esmeralda has arranged \u2013 with Phoebus' consent, as Phoebus only wants one night of passion.  As Phoebus and Esmeralda are about to make love, Frollo, in a jealous rage, stabs Phoebus, and kisses Esmeralda when she faints before fleeing.\n\nFrollo does not attempt to intercede when Esmeralda is turned over to the magistrate on charges of [[witchcraft]] and attempted murder, but he stabs himself during her torture and shows her the wound as a proof of his lust for her. She is unmoved, however, as she is still in love with Phoebus. Shortly before the day she is to be executed, Frollo leaves Paris in a feverish madness, not realizing that Quasimodo \u2013 who is in love with her \u2013 has rescued her from the gallows. When he returns to the news that Esmeralda is still alive, he becomes as jealous of Quasimodo as he was of Phoebus. Frollo later attempts to [[rape]] her at her sanctuary in the cathedral, but Quasimodo \u2013 who doesn't realize who Esmeralda's attacker is at first \u2013 comes to the girl's defense and beats him up. Angered and humiliated, Frollo decides to rid himself of Esmeralda by handing her over to the authorities.\n\nFrollo's time comes when a group of scoundrels, enraged by news that the French monarchy has ordered Esmeralda to be taken from the cathedral and hanged within three days, arms themselves to assault Notre Dame Cathedral. While Quasimodo is busy fighting off the scoundrels, [[Pierre Gringoire]], Esmeralda's husband \u2013 whom she only married to save his life \u2013 and a hooded figure sneak into the Cathedral and convince Esmeralda to sneak out with them. The man's face is hidden behind a hood, leaving Esmeralda to guess his identity. They flee to a boat on the [[River Seine]], then separate when they head to shore, with Gringoire taking her goat, Djali, and leaving Esmeralda with the unknown man. The hooded figure drags Esmeralda to a nearby gallows and identifies himself as Frollo by removing his hood.\n\nFrollo issues Esmeralda his final ultimatum: either she must submit to him, or he will hand her over to the authorities. She rejects him, so he leaves her to an [[anchorite|anchoress]] to hold her for the royal soldiers coming to hang her and goes back to Notre Dame Cathedral. He then walks up to one of the cathedral's towers to watch the girl being hanged, unaware that Quasimodo has spotted him and followed him upstairs. He watches calmly while Esmeralda is taken to the gallows.\n\nWhen Quasimodo sees him laughing at Esmeralda's hanging, he becomes enraged and pushes Frollo off the balustrade. A gargoyle stops his fall, and he cries out to Quasimodo for help, but Quasimodo remains silent. Then Frollo falls down off the cathedral, colliding with the roof of a house. He slides down the roof, hits the pavement of the town square and dies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Victor|last=Hugo|authorlink=Victor Hugo|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame.html?id=hZtfvHDFHE4C|title=The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|date=1831|edition=1993|publisher=[[Wordsworth Editions]]|location=Ware, Hertfordshire, England|isbn=978-1853260681|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n[[Victor Hugo]]'s [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|novel]] has been adapted to film on numerous occasions.

The [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|1939 film]] had a similar change for the same reason due to policy of the [[Hays Production Code]];<ref name=\"OurDailyRead\"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lee|last=Pfieffer|title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame-film-1939|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|Britannica Online]]}}</ref> the only difference is that Claude is portrayed as the [[Archbishop of Paris]] and Jehan (played by [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]]) is portrayed as [[King Louis XI]]'s [[chief justice]] of [[Paris, France|Paris]].

He despises Paris\u2019 Gypsy population and desires to wipe out their entire race. Like his original character in Victor Hugo's novel, Frollo lusts after Esmeralda to the point of obsession, and demands her to choose to be his or die. Frollo believes everything he does is in accordance with God's will, despite frequent disagreements with the Archdeacon of Notre Dame.<ref name=\"disneyandsin.weebly\">{{cite web | url=http://disneyandsin.weebly.com/lust.html | title=Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref> While in the novel Frollo genuinely cares for Quasimodo, in this film he is Quasimodo's reluctant guardian and took him in only out of fear of God\u2019s punishment and the hope that the hunchback will someday be useful to him. Trousdale described the film's Frollo as \"a horrible, horrible person\", while Jay compared him to [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref name=fictionmachine/>\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Frollo and his soldiers capture a group of [[Romani people|Gypsy]] peasants attempting to sneak illegally into Paris on a boat. A Gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo kills her outside [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]]. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's [[archdeacon]] intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. Fearing [[divine retribution]], Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him \"Quasimodo\", and teaching him that the world outside the cathedral is a sinful place full of people who would hate him for his deformity.\n\nTwenty years later, in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]], Frollo appoints a new [[Captain of the Guard]], Phoebus, stating his intent to eradicate the city's Gypsy population by discovering their sanctuary, the \"[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]\". While attending the annual [[Festival of Fools]], Frollo discovers a Gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, who attracts him with her beauty. He finds that Quasimodo has left the bell tower and joined the Festival. Quasimodo is humiliated by the crowd after two of Frollo's guards start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, going so far as to refuse Phoebus' request to stop it, and he is angered when Esmeralda defiantly decides to help Quasimodo. Esmeralda rebukes Frollo before claiming [[sanctuary]] inside the cathedral.\n\nFrollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and begs the [[Virgin Mary]] to save him from her \"[[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\"; he then resolves that \u201cshe will be mine, or she will burn\u201d. When Frollo learns that she has escaped Notre Dame, he instigates a citywide manhunt for her, even going as far as capturing and bribing Gypsies and [[Arson|burning]] countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's actions and openly defies him, and Frollo sentences him to death. While fleeing on Frollo's horse, Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the [[River Seine]], but Esmeralda rescues him just in time and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge.\n\nFrollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo had helped Esmeralda escape. He lies to Quasimodo, saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn with 1,000 men. Following Quasimodo and Phoebus to the Court of Miracles, Frollo and his men capture all the Gypsies present. Frollo prepares to [[Death by burning|burn Esmeralda at the stake]], but offers to spare her life if she submits to his desires. A disgusted Esmeralda refuses and spits on his face, and Frollo prepares to execute her. Quasimodo rescues her, however, and brings her to the cathedral. Frollo orders his soldiers to attack and seize the cathedral. Phoebus releases the Gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men. Quasimodo pours molten lead onto the streets to ensure that no one enters, but Frollo manages to get inside. Frollo attempts to kill Quasimodo, but Quasimodo overpowers him, and openly rejects everything that Frollo raised him to believe. Frollo pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony, where he taunts Quasimodo with the truth about his mother. Frollo knocks Quasimodo over the edge, but Quasimodo manages to hold on and ends up pulling Frollo along with him. Frollo climbs onto a gargoyle and raises his sword to strike at Esmeralda, but the gargoyle crumbles underneath him, causing him to lose his balance. In a vision, Frollo sees the gargoyle's face transform into that of [[Satan]]. Terrified, Frollo screams as the gargoyle breaks off entirely, sending him falling to his death into the molten lead below.\n\n===Later appearances===\n* Frollo appears in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] night-time show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', called on by the [[Queen (Snow White)#Disney version|Evil Queen]] to fight [[Mickey Mouse]]. He is destroyed along with the other villains in the show's conclusion. Frollo made appearances at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the daily Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade. In 2009, the parade moved to the [[Walt Disney Studios Park|Walt Disney Studios]] park at [[Disneyland Resort Paris]] and it is uncertain if Frollo will appear in this version, renamed Stars'n'Cars. Frollo makes a brief cameo appearance during the night-time show [[World of Color|Disney's ''World of Color'']] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]. \"[[Hellfire (song)|Hellfire]]\", the song that Frollo sings in the feature film, is also heard in the show. Frollo also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]].\n* Frollo makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' special ''[[Mickey's House of Villains|House of Villains]]''. He is seen sitting with the [[Mad Hatter]], who makes fun of his bulbous hat. He has no dialogue.\n* Frollo appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', along with a world based on the Disney film called '''La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches'''. He plays out the same role as in the movie, though he is one of the few Disney villains who does not serve as a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle. In the video game, he mistakes Sora for a gypsy, and Riku refers to him as \"a sad old man with a dark heart.\" During the game, while the Sora scenario has Frollo die in the same manner as the movie, the Riku scenario had him fall to his death as a consequence of an updraft called by Wargoyle (whom Frollo refers to it as not a \"demon\", but as \"righteous judgement\", a power granted to him for wiping out the entire gypsy population \"now and forever\"). In ''Dream Drop Distance'', Frollo is voiced by Shouzou Sasaki in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version and by [[Corey Burton]] in the English version.\n* Frollo leads a team of Disney villains in ''The Kingdom Keepers IV: Power Play'' in order to free their leaders, [[Maleficent]] and [[Chernabog]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n* [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda (''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'')]]\n* [[Quasimodo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120815041619/http://www.claudefrollo.com/ Illustration Gallery]\n* Frollo in the [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/frollo/frollo.html Disney Archives-Villains].\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frollo, Claude}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains]]\n[[Category:Fictional alchemists]]\n[[Category:Fictional judges]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors|Claude Frollo#Disney Version|Claude Frollo]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "name_user": "WikiLover4Ever", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made edit on an adaptation that is not titled \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Frollo"}
