In response, Garcia came up with \"Grateful Dead\" by opening a [[Funk & Wagnalls]] dictionary to an entry for \"[[Grateful dead (folklore)|Grateful dead]]\".<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> The definition for \"Grateful dead\" was \"a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial\".<ref>Stories about the \"Grateful Dead\" appear in many cultures.</ref> The band's first reaction was disapproval.<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia later explained the group's reaction: \"I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful.

His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/> Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that \"there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh's] innovative bass playing.

I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them.

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/>\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|thumb|left|Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] \nGarcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21259-electric-etudes-jerry-garcia|title=Electric Etudes: Jerry Garcia|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> Echoes of bluegrass playing (such as [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith|Arthur Smith]] and [[Doc Watson]]) could be heard. There was also early [[Rock and roll#Early North American rock and roll (1953-1963)|rock]] (like [[Lonnie Mack]], [[James Burton]], and Chuck Berry), contemporary [[Blues#History of modern blues|blues]] ([[Freddie King]] and [[Lowell Fulsom]]), [[country music|country and western]] ([[Roy Nichols]] and [[Don Rich]]), and [[jazz]] ([[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in [[Buck Owens]]'s \"[[the Buckaroos]]\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's [[pedal steel guitar]] playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player [[Tom Brumley]]. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.\n\nGarcia later described his playing style as having \"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \"signatures\".  Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", \"New Speedway Boogie\", \"Brokedown Palace\", \"Deal\", \"Loser\", \"[[Truckin']]\", \"That's It for the Other One\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"[[Sugaree]]\", and \"Don't Ease Me In\").\n\n===Side projects===\nIn addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the [[Jerry Garcia Band]]. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as [[Old & In the Way]] and other bluegrass bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist [[David Grisman]]. The documentary film ''[[Grateful Dawg]]'', co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265212|title=Grateful Dawg (2000)|author=Ali_Catterall|date=July 4, 2002|work=IMDb}}</ref> When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. \n\nOther groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |title=Black Mountain Boys |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022052842/http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 }} photo at eyecandypromo.com.

Garcia was also a fan of jazz artists and [[Jazz#Improvisation|improvisation]]: he played with jazz keyboardists [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Howard Wales]] for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]]'s 1988 album, ''[[Primetime (musical ensemble)|Virgin Beauty]]''. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and [[Muruga Booker]] on the world music album ''Blues From the Rainforest'' launched the [[Rainforest Band]].\n\nGarcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (most notably ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'', Garcia being listed as their \"spiritual advisor\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \"Today,\" played on \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"Comin' Back to Me\" on that album. Others include [[Tom Fogerty]], [[David Bromberg]], Robert Hunter (''Liberty'', on Relix Records), [[Paul Pena]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Pete Sears]], [[Ken Nordine]], Ornette Coleman, [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD ''[[Blue Incantation]]'' by guitarist [[Sanjay Mishra (musician)|Sanjay Mishra]], making it his last studio collaboration.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer [[Mickey Hart]], and [[David Crosby]] collaborated intermittently with [[MIT]]-educated composer and biologist [[Ned Lagin]] on several projects in the realm of early [[ambient music]]; these include the album ''[[Seastones]]'' (released by the Ned Lagin on the [[Grateful Dead Records|Round Records]] subsidiary) and ''L'', an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.\n\nGarcia also played pedal steel guitar for fellow-San Francisco musicians [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album ''[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|New Riders of the Purple Sage]]'', and produced ''Home, Home on the Road'', a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \"Teach Your Children\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]]. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on [[Brewer & Shipley]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tarkio (album)|Tarkio]]''. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \"Soviet American Peace Walk\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with [[Nick Gravenites]] and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist [[Brian Willson]], who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.\n\nHaving previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, [[etchings]], and [[water colors]]. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1989 to 1996.<ref>{{harvnb|Higashi|2005|pp=176-177}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=April 2020}} During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.<ref>S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992</ref> These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of [[digital art]] media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.<ref name=\"garciaweirgallery.com\">{{cite web| title=Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir| url=http://www.garciaweirgallery.com/| publisher=Weir Gallery| accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd.

However, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the [[Eugene, Oregon]] area, living near Kesey, in 1978. \n\nGarcia had an affair with Amy Moore. She was a [[Kentucky]]-born member of the extended \"Grateful Dead family\", and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen. Their affiar lasted circa 1980\u20131981, and inspired the Garcia-Hunter song \"Run for the Roses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://insiderlouisville.com/lifestyle_culture/grateful-dead-manager-rock-scullys-louisville-years/ | title=Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully's Louisville years | first=David | last=Serchuk | work=Insider Louisville | date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdams and Garcia were married on December 31, 1981, largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies.

Garcia lived with a variety of housemates, including band publicist, and ''Jerry Garcia Band'' manager, [[Rock Scully]]. Scully was dismissed by the group in 1984 for enabling Garcia's addictions, and for allegedly embezzling the bands profits. Another housemat was Nora Sage, a housekeeper, and law student.

Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]], who abstained from all drugs as a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bill Kreutzmann, the band's use of [[cocaine]] accelerated throughout the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkavBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22cocaine%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNhMfr9IbPAhWB6iYKHbpCDWEQ6AEIPzAG#v=snippet&q=%22cocaine%22&f=false | title=Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead | first1=Bill | last1=Kreutzmann | first2=Benjy | last2=Eisen | date=2015 | publisher=Macmillan | accessdate=May 5, 2017 | via=Google Books}}</ref> After experimenting with heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band's second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined [[opium]]) colloquially known as \"Persian\" or \"Persian Base\" during the group's 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \"cracking and crumbling\",<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}} resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] left the band in February 1979.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the addition of keyboardist/vocalist [[Brent Mydland]] that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the [[Deadhead]] subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day ({{Inflation|US|700|1982|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including acoustic duo concerts with longtime Jerry Garcia Band bassist [[John Kahn]] that seldom extended beyond an hour and a half and were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.\n\nThough things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \"endless tour\"\u2014the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions\u2014had taken its toll.\n\nGarcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in January 1985.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for [[drug possession]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.\n\nPrecipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/><ref name=\"jerrynews\"/> He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of [[protoplasm]] that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\"<ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\nAfter Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.\n\nMydland died of a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists [[Vince Welnick]] and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a [[methadone]] clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included [[Acupuncture|acupuncturist]] Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home.

Beginning in late 1967 and ending in 1968, Garcia played black or gold mid-1950s [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitars with [[P-90]] pickups. In 1969, he picked up the [[Gibson SG]] and used it for most of that year and 1970, except for a small period in between where he used a [[Sunburst (finish)|sunburst]] [[Fender Stratocaster]].\n\nDuring Garcia's \"pedal steel flirtation period\" (as Bob Weir referred to it in ''[[Anthem to Beauty]]''), from approximately 1969 to 1972, he initially played a Fender instrument before upgrading to the ZB Custom D-10,<ref>{{cite book|title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History|first=Bob|last=Gulla|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=978-0-31335-806-7|p=87}}</ref> especially in his earlier public performances.

In March and April 1971 \u2013 the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Grateful Dead'']] \u2013 Garcia played the \"Peanut,\" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early 60's Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rickturnerblog.com/2017/12/05/garcias-turner-peanut-guitar/ |title=Garcia's Turner \"Peanut Guitar\" |last=Turner |first=Rick |date=December 17, 2017 |website=rickturnerblog.com |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by [[Graham Nash]].

Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> It cost $1,500 ({{inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}), an extremely high price for the era.<ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/wolf/wolf.htm|title=The Wolf guitar|accessdate=July 17, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref>\n\nWolf was made with an [[ebony]] [[fingerboard]] and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the [[headstock]], [[ivory]] inlays, and fret marker dots made of [[sterling silver]]. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of [[purpleheart]]. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly [[single coil]]s, while the other accommodated [[humbucker]]s. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \"Don't hold back.\"<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nDuring the Grateful Dead's [[Dick's Picks Volume 7|1974 European tour]], Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of ''The Grateful Dead Movie'' (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several [[Travis Bean]] guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \"see\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}\n\nNearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar ([[Tiger (guitar)|Tiger]]) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105051821/http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|url-status=dead|title=Garcia Guitar Directory - Tiger - Irwin|date=January 5, 2013|archivedate=January 5, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the [[Oakland Auditorium Arena]] on August 4, 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\"/> Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.<ref name=\"tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/tiger/info.html|title=The Tiger guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was [[cocobolo]], with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and [[flame maple]], in that order.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil [[DiMarzio]] SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.\n\nIn the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.  There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.  He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \"tree of life\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese [[luthier]] Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.  As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.\n\nIn 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar.<ref name=\"rosebud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=The Rosebud guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording ''[[Without a Net]]''.<ref name=\"rosebud\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=Rosebud by Doug Irwin|publisher=}}</ref> Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to {{convert|11+1/2|lbs|kg}}. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a [[rose]], covers a plate just below the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 ({{inflation|US|11000|1990|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"rosebud\"/>\n\nIn 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia.<ref name=\"guithis\"/> After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay.<ref name=\"lightbolt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitar/Bolt.html|title=The Lightning Bolt guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to \"wing it.\"<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/>\n\nCripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name Top Hat. Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> However, infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup.\n\nAfter Garcia's death, the ownership of his Wolf and Tiger came into question.

Around this time, the psychedelic drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: \"Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I suddenly realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it for it to be shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/>\n\nIn 1965, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the Warlocks, with the addition of Phil Lesh on bass guitar and [[Bill Kreutzmann]] on [[Drum kit|percussion]]. However, the band discovered that another group (which would later become the [[Velvet Underground]]) had recently selected the same name. In response, Garcia came up with \"Grateful Dead\" by opening a [[Funk & Wagnalls]] dictionary to an entry for \"[[Grateful dead (folklore)|Grateful dead]]\".<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> The definition for \"Grateful dead\" was \"a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial\".<ref>Stories about the \"Grateful Dead\" appear in many cultures.</ref> The band's first reaction was disapproval.<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia later explained the group's reaction: \"I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [Bob] Weir didn't like it, [Bill] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted to hear about it.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/> Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.\n\n===Career with the Grateful Dead===\n[[File:Jerry Garcia 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jerry Garcia in 1969]]\nGarcia served as lead guitarist, as well as one of the principal vocalists and songwriters of the Grateful Dead for its entire career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/hole-notes-acoustic-stylings-late-jerry-garcia|title=The Acoustic Stylings of the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia|work=Guitar World|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-us}}</ref> Garcia composed such songs as \"[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\">{{cite web|url=http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/|title=The Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics|accessdate=July 12, 2007|year=2007|author=Dodd, David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404063019/http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/|archive-date=April 4, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Franklin's Tower\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> and \"[[Scarlet Begonias]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> among many others.

His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/> Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that \"there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh's] innovative bass playing.

I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them. With most solos, I tend to play something that phrases the way the melody does; my phrases may be more dense or have different value, but they'll occur in the same places in the song.

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/>\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|thumb|left|Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] \nGarcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21259-electric-etudes-jerry-garcia|title=Electric Etudes: Jerry Garcia|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> Echoes of bluegrass playing (such as [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith|Arthur Smith]] and [[Doc Watson]]) could be heard. There was also early [[Rock and roll#Early North American rock and roll (1953-1963)|rock]] (like [[Lonnie Mack]], [[James Burton]], and Chuck Berry), contemporary [[Blues#History of modern blues|blues]] ([[Freddie King]] and [[Lowell Fulsom]]), [[country music|country and western]] ([[Roy Nichols]] and [[Don Rich]]), and [[jazz]] ([[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in [[Buck Owens]]'s \"[[the Buckaroos]]\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's [[pedal steel guitar]] playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player [[Tom Brumley]]. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.\n\nGarcia later described his playing style as having \"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \"signatures\".  Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", \"New Speedway Boogie\", \"Brokedown Palace\", \"Deal\", \"Loser\", \"[[Truckin']]\", \"That's It for the Other One\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"[[Sugaree]]\", and \"Don't Ease Me In\").\n\n===Side projects===\nIn addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the [[Jerry Garcia Band]]. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as [[Old & In the Way]] and other bluegrass bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist [[David Grisman]]. The documentary film ''[[Grateful Dawg]]'', co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265212|title=Grateful Dawg (2000)|author=Ali_Catterall|date=July 4, 2002|work=IMDb}}</ref> When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. \n\nOther groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |title=Black Mountain Boys |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022052842/http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 }} photo at eyecandypromo.com.

Garcia was also a fan of jazz artists and [[Jazz#Improvisation|improvisation]]: he played with jazz keyboardists [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Howard Wales]] for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]]'s 1988 album, ''[[Primetime (musical ensemble)|Virgin Beauty]]''. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and [[Muruga Booker]] on the world music album ''Blues From the Rainforest'' launched the [[Rainforest Band]].\n\nGarcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (most notably ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'', Garcia being listed as their \"spiritual advisor\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \"Today,\" played on \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"Comin' Back to Me\" on that album. Others include [[Tom Fogerty]], [[David Bromberg]], Robert Hunter (''Liberty'', on Relix Records), [[Paul Pena]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Pete Sears]], [[Ken Nordine]], Ornette Coleman, [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD ''[[Blue Incantation]]'' by guitarist [[Sanjay Mishra (musician)|Sanjay Mishra]], making it his last studio collaboration.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer [[Mickey Hart]], and [[David Crosby]] collaborated intermittently with [[MIT]]-educated composer and biologist [[Ned Lagin]] on several projects in the realm of early [[ambient music]]; these include the album ''[[Seastones]]'' (released by the Ned Lagin on the [[Grateful Dead Records|Round Records]] subsidiary) and ''L'', an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.\n\nGarcia also played pedal steel guitar for fellow-San Francisco musicians [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album ''[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|New Riders of the Purple Sage]]'', and produced ''Home, Home on the Road'', a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \"Teach Your Children\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]]. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on [[Brewer & Shipley]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tarkio (album)|Tarkio]]''. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \"Soviet American Peace Walk\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with [[Nick Gravenites]] and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist [[Brian Willson]], who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.\n\nHaving previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, [[etchings]], and [[water colors]]. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1989 to 1996.<ref>{{harvnb|Higashi|2005|pp=176-177}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=April 2020}} During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.<ref>S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992</ref> These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of [[digital art]] media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.<ref name=\"garciaweirgallery.com\">{{cite web| title=Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir| url=http://www.garciaweirgallery.com/| publisher=Weir Gallery| accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Years after Garcia's death, his estate granted the license to Mulberry Street which resulted in a lawsuit and settlement with the original manufacturer, and new styles and designs continue to be produced and sold.\n\n==Personal life==\nGarcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal, in 1963.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> She was working at the coffee house in the back of Kepler's Books, where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed.

However, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the [[Eugene, Oregon]] area, living near Kesey, in 1978. \n\nGarcia had an affair with Amy Moore. She was a [[Kentucky]]-born member of the extended \"Grateful Dead family\", and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen.

Garcia lived with a variety of housemates, including band publicist, and ''Jerry Garcia Band'' manager, [[Rock Scully]]. Scully was dismissed by the group in 1984 for enabling Garcia's addictions, and for allegedly embezzling the bands profits. Another housemat was Nora Sage, a housekeeper, and law student.

Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \"cracking and crumbling\",<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}} resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] left the band in February 1979.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the addition of keyboardist/vocalist [[Brent Mydland]] that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the [[Deadhead]] subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day ({{Inflation|US|700|1982|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including acoustic duo concerts with longtime Jerry Garcia Band bassist [[John Kahn]] that seldom extended beyond an hour and a half and were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.\n\nThough things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \"endless tour\"\u2014the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions\u2014had taken its toll.\n\nGarcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in January 1985.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for [[drug possession]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.\n\nPrecipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/><ref name=\"jerrynews\"/> He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of [[protoplasm]] that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\"<ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\nAfter Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.\n\nMydland died of a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists [[Vince Welnick]] and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a [[methadone]] clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.<ref>{{harvnb|Lesh|2005|p=}}</ref> Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included [[Acupuncture|acupuncturist]] Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate.<ref>{{cite book | title=Aces Back to Back: The History of the Grateful Dead (1965\u20132013) | first=Scott W. | last=Allen | date=2014 | publisher=Outskirts Press, Inc. | isbn=978-1-4787-1943-4 | page=135}}</ref> Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight.

Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. \n\nIn light of his second drug relapse and current condition, Garcia checked himself into the [[Betty Ford Center]] during July 1995.

Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> It cost $1,500 ({{inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}), an extremely high price for the era.<ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/wolf/wolf.htm|title=The Wolf guitar|accessdate=July 17, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref>\n\nWolf was made with an [[ebony]] [[fingerboard]] and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the [[headstock]], [[ivory]] inlays, and fret marker dots made of [[sterling silver]]. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of [[purpleheart]]. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly [[single coil]]s, while the other accommodated [[humbucker]]s. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \"Don't hold back.\"<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nDuring the Grateful Dead's [[Dick's Picks Volume 7|1974 European tour]], Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of ''The Grateful Dead Movie'' (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several [[Travis Bean]] guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \"see\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}\n\nNearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar ([[Tiger (guitar)|Tiger]]) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105051821/http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|url-status=dead|title=Garcia Guitar Directory - Tiger - Irwin|date=January 5, 2013|archivedate=January 5, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the [[Oakland Auditorium Arena]] on August 4, 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\"/> Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.<ref name=\"tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/tiger/info.html|title=The Tiger guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was [[cocobolo]], with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and [[flame maple]], in that order.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard.

Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.\n\nIn the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.  There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.  He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \"tree of life\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese [[luthier]] Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.  As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.\n\nIn 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar.<ref name=\"rosebud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=The Rosebud guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording ''[[Without a Net]]''.<ref name=\"rosebud\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=Rosebud by Doug Irwin|publisher=}}</ref> Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to {{convert|11+1/2|lbs|kg}}. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a [[rose]], covers a plate just below the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 ({{inflation|US|11000|1990|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"rosebud\"/>\n\nIn 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia.<ref name=\"guithis\"/> After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay.<ref name=\"lightbolt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitar/Bolt.html|title=The Lightning Bolt guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to \"wing it.\"<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/>\n\nCripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name Top Hat. Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> However, infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup.\n\nAfter Garcia's death, the ownership of his Wolf and Tiger came into question.

Passing note is made of the JFK assassination and funeral. ''Bandstand'' immediately becomes the principal creative pillar of ''American Dreams'', with each episode featuring recreated versions of several musical acts that originally appeared on the real ''Bandstand'', often rendered by modern singers.\n\nJJ Pryor, a running back for the East Catholic Fighting Crusaders football team, tries and fails to earn a full athletic scholarship to play at the [[University of Notre Dame]], so he later applies for and is accepted to [[Lehigh University]]. A nagging ankle injury curtails his football career, so he enlists in the [[United States Marine Corps]] to pay for school. Meanwhile, JJ's on-again, off-again girlfriend Beth chooses to attend the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in order to be near JJ.\n\nIn the early part of the season, Meg develops a [[puppy love|crush]] on a ''Bandstand'' dancer, and they go on a couple of public appearance dates. While never becoming romantic, they remained good friends. Meg later developed a romance with Luke Foley, a record store clerk and fellow East Catholic student.\n\nSam Walker wins a [[track and field|track]] [[athletic scholarship]] to East Catholic. Sam's father Henry states that there are only three other black male students at East Catholic; some in the majority-white student body resent Sam's presence, especially Tommy DeFelice, who is later expelled after falsely confessing to JJ's crime of breaking Beth's current boyfriend's windshield. Sam and Meg develop a friendship, even creating a record-swapping club while meeting at the Vinyl Crocodile record store.\n\nIn the season finale on May 18, 2003, Meg and Sam are caught in the [[Philadelphia 1964 race riot|summer 1964 race riot in Philadelphia]].\n\n===Season 2 (2003\u201304)===\nMeg and Sam survive the riots unharmed, but the branch of Jack's store under Henry's management is destroyed. Gwen dies from [[cancer]]. JJ excels at boot camp and arrives in [[Vietnam]]. While on leave, he and Beth are reunited in Hawaii; they break up, but Beth soon learns she is pregnant with JJ's child, and she moves in with the Pryors.\n\nHelen discovers that there might be a possible surgical treatment for Will's paralysis, and the early part of the season deals with Will's medical treatment. By the end of the season, Will's leg braces have been removed and he is able to walk normally.\n\nRoxanne exchanges promise rings with boyfriend Lenny, and goes on tour with him before returning home. Later on, she dates Meg's ex-boyfriend, Luke. Meg dates a college boy, Drew, despite JJ and her father's strong dislike for him, but breaks it off when he ends up cheating on her.\n\nSam wins a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. Jack decides to run for the [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]]. In the season finale on April 4, 2004, Sam's cousin Nathan is drafted and opts to go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Also in that episode, JJ is caught in a fierce [[battle|firefight]], while Meg and Sam are arrested at a campus rally protesting the Vietnam war.\n\n===Season 3 (2004\u201305)===\nThe arrests widen the communications gap between parents and children, and inspire Meg to lead additional protests. A strict new headmaster also fires Meg up. An injured JJ wakes up in an American military hospital, and learns of his forthcoming child; Beth refuses to accept JJ's offer of marriage. Roxanne, estranged from her mother, moves in with the Pryors. JJ gets recruited for special, somewhat mysterious duty for the US government. Jack wins an upset victory for the City Council.\n\nAs Thanksgiving nears closer, JJ is captured by the Viet Cong. He and his sergeant escape, but are presumed missing in action (the sergeant is later found buried in a shallow grave). The Pryors learn of JJ's \"Missing In Action\" status just before Thanksgiving.\n\nLuke Foley returns to Philadelphia, and Roxanne, who moves out on her remarrying mother, moves in with him in a loft above the Vinyl Crocodile record store.\n\nOn a commercial-free special episode that aired November 21, 2004, JJ returns home. At episode's end he glares harshly at his mother. In the next original episode, JJ becomes a Marine recruiter and suffers from post-traumatic flashbacks. He proposes to Beth. Beth and JJ are married on the January 23, 2005 episode. Helen becomes involved with a Catholic peace group.\n\nAs the show enters 1966, JJ marries Beth in a ceremony held at the Pryors' catholic church. Jack Pryor, newly elected to the Philadelphia City Council, is forced to take a bribe, with the money going to help JJ repay some gambling debts. Eventually Jack votes to elect a local activist in his district, Reverend Davis, to the Police Review Board essentially voting against the Council. For this act of disloyalty, several members of the police force beat up JJ after a traffic stop. Pete soon finds the culprits who attacked JJ and roughs them up, but Jack decides to resign from the Council.\n\nChris and Meg's relationship becomes more intimate, but Meg is troubled by reports that Chris helped set fire to a recruitment center. Despite this, Meg and Chris eventually have sex\u2014with Chris revealing afterward that he did indeed lie to Meg about the recruitment center. Meg and Chris eventually break up, and Chris leaves Philadelphia.\n\nMeg and Sam consider the possibility of a romantic relationship, but JJ and Nathan discourage the idea. Meanwhile, Jack and Pete's older brother Ted gets into a serious car accident, putting him on a respirator. After much soul searching, the Pryors decide to disconnect the machine. After returning home from a Rolling Stones concert, Meg finds her ex-boyfriend Chris standing in front of her home. He's just been drafted.\n\nIn the season/series finale, Meg and Chris both leave Philadelphia on Chris' motorcycle, with plans for them to live in [[Berkeley, California]] and campaign against the war. JJ Pryor applies for and receives a job in aeronautics, assisting in space suit design for future [[NASA]] missions to the moon.\n\n==Timeline of events in the series==\n\n===\"Past\" events===\n*c. 1920 - Jack Pryor is born.\n*c. 1927 - Helen Dolan is born.\n*c.

In the third season, the show was regularly beaten in the Sunday night ratings by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' and [[CBS]]'s ''[[Cold Case]]''. On February 2, 2005, NBC reduced the number of third-season episodes of ''American Dreams'' from 19 to 17. The network also moved the program away from its original Sunday night timeslot to Wednesday nights, airing before ''[[The West Wing]]''. This put the show up against [[CBS]]'s ''[[Survivor: Palau]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and ''American Dreams'' could not compete against these popular programs.\n\nAs the third season wound down, actors on the show filmed pilots for new shows to possibly air in the 2005\u201306 television season. Fans of ''American Dreams'' organized a campaign to save the show, sending over 5000 supportive e-mails to NBC after the season finale and several thousand postcards to the network as well. On May 4, 2005, fans flew an aerial banner over NBC's Burbank studios in support of the show, even as the show's sets were being dismantled at Sunset-Gower Studios, where it was filmed.\n\nIt had been reported that ''American Dreams'' may have been canceled as early as December 2004. Jonathan Prince mentioned in a ''Miami Herald'' article that he was able to get four additional episodes made by having companies such as Kraft and Nabisco pay for additional episodes in exchange for product placement (Campbell's Soups and Ford also participated in product placement episodes).\n\n==Series epilogue==\n''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported on April 12, 2005 that in late February, [[NBC]] ordered two endings filmed for the season finale.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/11370090.htm |title=At Philly.com (Broken Link) |website=philly.com |access-date=2005-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904225249/http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/11370090.htm |archive-date=2006-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> The un-aired ending was reported to be a 12-minute segment set on July 20, 1969 (the day [[Apollo 11]] landed on the [[Moon]]), with Meg returning home to face her family after a three-year absence.\n\nNBC opted not to air the 12-minute epilogue when the third-season finale aired on March 30, 2005, a month and a half before the official cancellation of the series. ''[[TV Guide]]'' reported on July 26, 2005 that this epilogue was likely to air in a rerun of the third-season finale in August or September, but the airing never materialized. NBC was unable to attract sponsorship for the segment, which reportedly contained many rock-and-roll oldies, resulting in expensive music licensing fees for the network.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=153240 |title=The Final Update on the Finale:\"officially DOA\" (10/5) - Sitcoms Online Message Boards - Forums |website=sitcomsonline.com |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102238/http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=153240 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the second annual [[ATX Television Festival]] on June 9, 2013, the cast and crew of the show were reunited, and creator Jonathan Prince unveiled for the first time to both the cast and audience, a rough cut of the never-before-seen epilogue.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2013/06/09/american-dreams-reunion-alternate-ending-atx-festival/ |title=\u2018American Dreams\u2019 Reunion \u2014 Alternate Ending Spoilers - TVLine |last=Megan Masters |website=TVLine |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024339/http://tvline.com/2013/06/09/american-dreams-reunion-alternate-ending-atx-festival/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Prudom\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/american-dreams-reunion-unaired-ending_n_3413896.html |title=How 'American Dreams' Was Supposed To End |last=Prudom |first=Laura |date=June 10, 2013 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=June 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616062059/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/american-dreams-reunion-unaired-ending_n_3413896.html |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the epilogue, a long-haired Meg is seen on a bus (with a caption reading \"Three Years Later\"). After a couple of fellow hippie travelers inquire about the purpose of her trip, Meg reveals that she's planning to attend Woodstock with Sam (who had just graduated from college), and has traveled upstate early in order to meet up with him. Meg also reveals that she still lives in Berkeley, and hasn't been back home since she left with Chris three years prior. Meg is also planning on staying in New York with Roxanne, who is now married to Luke and has a baby boy named Dustin. Meg later reveals that Patty has graduated from high school and is now attending college at Harvard's sister school, Radcliffe. Throughout her time on the bus (and her conversation with the hippies), Meg reflects on her experiences with her family and friends.\n\nAfter the hippies leave, Meg is seen pensively staring out of the bus window. The next moment, Meg is standing outside of her former home in Philadelphia, having taken a detour from heading to New York. She runs into her nephew Trip (who is now much older), who tells her that he knows who she is (based on family photos). When asked, she tells him that she came because she wanted to see her family. Trip tells her that everyone is inside, watching the first ever moon landing (placing the epilogue on July 20, 1969, the day [[Apollo 11]] landed on the [[Moon]]). Tripp reveals that JJ now has a job building space suits for astronauts. Suddenly, Jack (Meg's father) comes out and calls for Trip to come in, when he sees Meg. Trip goes inside, and Helen (Meg's mother) comes outside calling for Jack, but stops when she sees Meg.\n\nAn awkward silence passes among the three, until Jack invites Meg inside for leftovers. Jack enters the house as Meg walks up and grabs Helen in a hug, while Jack looks on from inside. Once everyone goes inside, the scene pans out, with Neil Armstrong's famous moon landing address providing a voiceover until the screen goes black.\n\n==Fourth season plotlines==\nIn interviews, Jonathan Prince revealed that if ''American Dreams'' had been renewed for a fourth season, the following plotlines would have been included.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/television/12318519.htm |title=South FL Things To Do, Restaurants & Nightlife - miami.com |website=Miami.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212120616/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/television/12318519.htm |archive-date=2005-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.al.com/tv/mobileregister/mbrantley.ssf?/base/entertainment/1113902204208630.xml |title=Television News & Reviews - al.com |website=al.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510170518/http://www.al.com/tv/mobileregister/mbrantley.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment%2F1113902204208630.xml |archive-date=2008-05-10 |access-date=29 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=136817 |title=Q & A from Jonathan Prince - Sitcoms Online Message Boards - Forums |website=sitcomsonline.com |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102237/http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=136817 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*The fourth season would have picked up in January 1967.\n*Meg would have returned to Philadelphia six episodes into the season after JJ goes to California with intentions to take her home.\n*Roxanne would have taken a job as the hairdresser for ''American Bandstand''.\n*Jack would become angry after discovering that Helen had been using her job as a travel agent to help young men dodge the draft and flee to Canada.\n*There would be tension in JJ and Beth's marriage, after Beth reluctantly agreed to JJ's wishes to postpone going back to college.\n*Henry would remarry and accept a new, deaf stepson into his home.\n*JJ would continue working for the company designing spacesuits for the manned mission to the moon.\n*The [[Apollo 1|Apollo 1 fire]] would somehow figure into the fourth season plotline.\n*Patty would serve as the Team Manager for the East Catholic football team.\n\n==Special guests==\nDuring the show's run, several contact artists recreated performances of artists from the 1960s. These recreations were often performed on the ''[[American Bandstand]]'' stage, although several performances took place at a performing area adjacent to the Vinyl Crocodile record store.

Several historic events were restaged earlier or later in the show's timeline to fit a plotline, and some of the music and pop culture references do not match up with either historic fact or the show's current timeline. Several arguments between the show's loyal fanbase can be traced to whether the show should be viewed as a chronologically accurate representation of life in 1960s Philadelphia, or is instead an idealized combination of mnemonic images and pop culture references from points throughout the 1960s, much as the film ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' was for the 1980s.\n\nSome examples of these disputes include:\n*A running plotline is the appearance of Meg and Roxanne as dancers on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', which still tapes a daily after-school show in Philadelphia; where in real life the show moved to [[Los Angeles]] in February 1964 and was only broadcast once a week, on Saturday afternoons (in real life, the studio used for ''Bandstand'' was later appropriated by the stations of [[public broadcasting]] operation [[WHYY-TV|WHYY]] after WFIL's donation of them shortly after moving to their new [[City Avenue]] studios).\n*In the pilot episode, Jack makes a reference to [[Ara Parseghian]] and [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]. The pilot was set in November 1963 while Parseghian was hired by Notre Dame in December.\n*In the first year, JJ Pryor Jr supposedly attended [[Lehigh University]] on a football scholarship in 1963 but joined the Marines when injured to pay for college. Lehigh doesn't have athletic scholarships but gives financial grants in aid instead. Thus he would have still had financial aid even if injured.\n*The [[Philadelphia 1964 race riot]] depicted in the first-season finale started at night, not in the daytime, as depicted in the show. Television footage of the riots shown on the episode actually came from the [[Watts riots]] of 1965 Los Angeles.\n*During the show's first season, the music of several artists, such as the [[Kinks]], [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Manfred Mann]], are heard and referenced in 1963, months before the [[Beatles]]' appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (February 1964) that triggered the musical [[British Invasion]].\n*When the Beatles appear on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', the scene is set up so that the first song the Beatles play is \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\", which was the Beatles' first American hit, but was not the first song played on ''Ed Sullivan'' (that honor goes to \"[[All My Loving]]\").\n*In one episode in the show's third season, set in late November 1965, the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|East Coast Blackout]] and the [[Leonid meteor shower]] were both \"rescheduled\" so that they would fall on the same day that Beth Mason gave birth to JJ Pryor's son.\n*In a first-season episode, Meg and Roxanne gush over meeting the group [[Jay and the Americans]], and Roxanne is especially enamored with \"Carl, the drummer\" (the group neither had a member named Carl, nor a drummer, in real life). Also in real life, there were two lead singers known as \"Jay\" - Jay Traynor, who sang on their hit \"She Cried\", and Jay Black, who replaced Traynor for the group's other hits&nbsp;\u2014 yet on the episode, it is assumed that there was only one \"Jay\" who sang all the hits without interruption.\n*In the show's first season, set in November 1963, Meg Pryor and Luke Foley argue over the merits of [[Bob Dylan]], and Luke hands Meg a 45 of Dylan singing \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]].\" In fact, Dylan did not write or perform the song until 1964, and he never released it on a commercial 45 (it appeared on his \"Bringing It All Back Home\" album released in early 1965), although the Byrds' rendition of it was a hit single. Note that before Luke hands meg the Dylan record, he specifically says that it is \"an advanced copy of the record that won't be released until next year.\"\n*References are made in the show's second season to [[I Dream of Jeannie]], which was still a year away from premiering. On top of that, \"the big band theme song\" heard, is the one introduced at the beginning of the show's second season (which was a re-creation of the original theme). It was performed & produced by LA guitarist Rick Fleishman, and it also featured LA session drummer [[Paul Goldberg (musician)|Paul Goldberg]]. (It's the one most viewers were familiar with in 1966).\n*[[The Monkees]] perform on the ''Bandstand'' stage in January 1966, despite their television series not even premiering until September 1966, or the four actors playing the Monkees even performing a live concert until a year later.\n*In an episode set in January/February 1965, [[Nancy Sinatra]] (Jennifer Love Hewitt) appears on American Bandstand to sing \"[[These Boots are Made for Walking]]\" despite the fact the song was not released until 1966.\n*While working at the space suit company, JJ Pryor meets [[Gus Grissom]], and they discuss the [[Apollo 1]] mission. Grissom later says, \"Get me back to [[Cape Canaveral]].\" In reality, the [[Apollo 1]] mission was not designated by that number or name until after the accident that claimed the lives of Grissom and two other astronauts (at the time the mission was known as Apollo/Saturn 204), and the reference to [[Cape Canaveral]] would have been wrong, as the area where the space center was located had been renamed \"Cape Kennedy\" during the 1960s. While the town was officially renamed back to [[Cape Canaveral]] in 1973, the space center was (and still is) known as the Kennedy Space Center, and at least three years had passed since the town was renamed from Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy; so although it is not impossible that in a casual conversation Grissom would have used the traditional name, it is still unlikely that this would happen.\n*Artists such as [[Blake Shelton]], [[John Ondrasik]] and [[Joss Stone]] are allowed to perform their current pop hits, which in real time would have been 40 years away from ever existing.\n*Neither [[The Who]] nor [[Ricky Nelson]] ever performed on the ''Bandstand'' stage in real life (Nelson's father Ozzie refused to allow his performing son to appear on anybody else's TV series, even if such appearance might help increase record sales); but that didn't stop the producers from staging performances by those artists in this series.\n*The Who is shown performing on Bandstand in the show's third season, set in 1965\u20131966. However The Who's first performance in the United States wasn't until the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967.\n*In an episode that is supposedly taking place in the spring of 1965, two customers at the TV store, played by ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' actors [[John Aniston]] and [[Frances Reid]], were watching an episode of ''Days of our Lives'' on a TV (Frances was watching herself on an early episode). ''Days of our Lives'' did not premiere until November 8, 1965.\n*In an episode purporting to take place in the summer of 1966, a character on \"American Bandstand\" is asked to rate the [[Rolling Stones]]' song \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\", despite the song being over a year old.\n*In a late third-season episode, Meg, Roxanne and Luke sit outside Connie Mack Stadium with lawn chairs, listening for free to the Rolling Stones, who are playing a live concert at the stadium. Luke makes a reference that he heard a Bob Dylan concert at Connie Mack Stadium for free this way. Bob Dylan did not play Connie Mack Stadium as an outdoor venue in 1966 or earlier.\n*In another third-season episode that takes place in June 1966, [[the Mamas and the Papas]] appear on [[American Bandstand]] to perform \"[[California Dreamin']]\". However, the Mamas and Papas actual appearance on the show was in February 1966, they did not appear again in June of that year.\n*Characters are depicted as listening to [[Cream (Band)|Cream's]] \"[[I Feel Free]]\" and [[The Spencer Davis Group]]'s \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" as early as the summer of 1965, despite neither song being released until late in 1966, after the timeline of the series had ended.\n\n==Home media==\nThe first season of ''American Dreams'' was released on [[DVD]] in September 2004. As of January no formal release dates have been announced for the remaining two seasons. Prince has promised that the series [[epilogue]] will appear in the third-season DVD release. However, it is widely believed that the huge number of licensed songs on the series make future DVD releases cost prohibitive, although Prince said that was not the case.<ref>http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=154774 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507153640/http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=154774 |date=2006-05-07 }} Ask Ausiello: Seasons 2 and 3 DVDs in '06</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americandreamsfanclub.com/FAQ.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707132615/http://www.americandreamsfanclub.com/FAQ.htm |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn January 26, 2009, it was reported that Prince and other producers from the show were negotiating to get the final two seasons released on DVD, along with including the unaired epilogue.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americandreamsfanclub.com/DVDrelease.htm|title=Hoping to see Seasons 2 and 3 on DVD<!-- Bot generated title -->|work=americandreamsfanclub.com|accessdate=29 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109014032/http://www.americandreamsfanclub.com/DVDrelease.htm|archive-date=9 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> No recent news was made until June 21, 2010, where it was reported that the producers \"are closer than ever to debuting a boxed set of all three seasons of ''American Dreams'' on DVD\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americandreamsfanclub.com/DVDrelease.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828193157/http://www.americandreamsfanclub.com/DVDrelease.htm |archive-date=2008-08-28 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, negotiations seem to have stalled, with negotiations continuing as of early 2013.\n\nAt the second annual [[ATX Television Festival]] on June 9, 2013, Prince spoke out on the hold-up on the home media release of seasons 2 and 3, admitting that because of costly music licensing issues, it was unlikely that NBC would find it cost-effective to make those licensing deals unless fans campaigned to prove that the DVDs would sell, suggesting a Kickstarter campaign to gauge interest.<ref name=\"Prudom\" />\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#EFEFEF\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | American Dreams&nbsp;\u2014 Season One (Extended Music Edition)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" width=\"150\"| <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:American Dreams - DVD S01.jpg|150px|]] -->\n! align=\"center\" width=\"250\" colspan=\"3\"| Set details\n! width=\"330\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"| Special features\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"left\" width=\"250\"|\n* 25 Episodes\n* 7-Disc Set\n* 1.33:1 Aspect Ratio\n* English (Dolby 5.1 Surround)\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"left\" width=\"330\"|\n* Audio Commentaries\n* 250 Rock 'n' Roll Hits\n* Promo Spots\n* Music Video with [[Stacie Orrico]] and the Cast\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | Release date\n|-\n|align=\"center\" width=\"120\"| {{USA}}\n|align=\"center\" | September 7, 2004\n|}\n\nThere are music alterations in the Season 1 DVD release in order to keep music licensing costs down.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/American-Dreams-Season-1-Extended-Music-Edition/3749 |title=American Dreams - Season 1 - Extended Music Edition |website=tvshowsondvd.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910201150/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/American-Dreams-Season-1-Extended-Music-Edition/3749 |archive-date=10 September 2015 |access-date=29 August 2015}}</ref> Prince has noted that the first season retains about \"80% of the original music\", keeping music he deemed critical to particular scenes, as well as performances of guest stars and music for the Bandstand dancers while replacing some background songs with \"cheaper needle-drops\" from the 1960s.

The show tells the story of the Pryor family of Philadelphia during the mid-1960s, with many plotlines centered around teenager Meg Pryor ([[Brittany Snow]]), who dances on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''. The show often featured contemporary musicians performing as popular musicians of the 1960s.  Season one takes place in 1963\u201364, season two in 1964\u201365, and season three in 1965\u201366.\n\nThe series was created by [[Jonathan Prince]] and developed by Josh Goldstein and Prince; the latter was also one of the executive producers with [[Dick Clark]]. It debuted on September 29, 2002 and initially aired on Sundays at 8:00 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], but moved to the same time on Wednesdays from March 9, 2005, to the third-season finale (March 30, 2005). The show was known as ''Our Generation'' when it debuted in Australia; however, it was changed back to ''American Dreams'' when it returned for the second season.\n\nThe theme song \"Generation\" was written and performed by [[Emerson Hart]], lead singer of the band [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]]. The song earned Hart an [[ASCAP]] award for Best Theme Song of Television in 2003. The show was the 2003 [[TV Land Awards]] \"Future Classic\" winner.\n\n==Series overview==\nIn 1963 Philadelphia, the Pryors are a close Irish-Catholic family. World War II veteran John \"Jack\" Pryor owns a television and radio store. He and his homemaker wife Helen have five children: High school senior and football player \"JJ\", younger sisters Meg and Patty, and younger brother Will, who is lame from polio. Jack employs Henry Walker, whose son Sam is among the few black students at East Catholic High School. Meg and best friend Roxanne pass the audition to dance on camera for [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]'', filmed in the city, while JJ hopes to win a football scholarship to play for the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]]. The show depicts historical events, such as the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], [[1964 Philadelphia race riot]], and American involvement in\u2014and [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to]]\u2014the [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]].\n\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #315482\n| link1      = #Season 1 (2002\u201303)\n| episodes1  = 25\n| start1     = {{Start date|2002|9|29}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2003|5|18}}\n\n| color2     = #191F28\n| link2      = #Season 2 (2003\u201304)\n| episodes2  = 19\n| start2     = {{Start date|2003|9|28}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2004|4|4}}\n\n| color3     = #C49166\n| link3      = #Season 3 (2004\u201305)\n| episodes3  = 17\n| start3     = {{Start date|2004|9|26}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2005|3|30}}\n}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brittany Snow]] as Margaret \"Meg\" Pryor: The show's protagonist.

Passing note is made of the JFK assassination and funeral. ''Bandstand'' immediately becomes the principal creative pillar of ''American Dreams'', with each episode featuring recreated versions of several musical acts that originally appeared on the real ''Bandstand'', often rendered by modern singers.\n\nJJ Pryor, a running back for the East Catholic Fighting Crusaders football team, tries and fails to earn a full athletic scholarship to play at the [[University of Notre Dame]], so he later applies for and is accepted to [[Lehigh University]]. A nagging ankle injury curtails his football career, so he enlists in the [[United States Marine Corps]] to pay for school. Meanwhile, JJ's on-again, off-again girlfriend Beth chooses to attend the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in order to be near JJ.\n\nIn the early part of the season, Meg develops a [[puppy love|crush]] on a ''Bandstand'' dancer, and they go on a couple of public appearance dates. While never becoming romantic, they remained good friends. Meg later developed a romance with Luke Foley, a record store clerk and fellow East Catholic student.\n\nSam Walker wins a [[track and field|track]] [[athletic scholarship]] to East Catholic. Sam's father Henry states that there are only three other black male students at East Catholic; some in the majority-white student body resent Sam's presence, especially Tommy DeFelice, who is later expelled after falsely confessing to JJ's crime of breaking Beth's current boyfriend's windshield. Sam and Meg develop a friendship, even creating a record-swapping club while meeting at the Vinyl Crocodile record store.\n\nIn the season finale on May 18, 2003, Meg and Sam are caught in the [[Philadelphia 1964 race riot|summer 1964 race riot in Philadelphia]].\n\n===Season 2 (2003\u201304)===\nMeg and Sam survive the riots unharmed, but the branch of Jack's store under Henry's management is destroyed. Gwen dies from [[cancer]]. JJ excels at boot camp and arrives in [[Vietnam]]. While on leave, he and Beth are reunited in Hawaii; they break up, but Beth soon learns she is pregnant with JJ's child, and she moves in with the Pryors.\n\nHelen discovers that there might be a possible surgical treatment for Will's paralysis, and the early part of the season deals with Will's medical treatment. By the end of the season, Will's leg braces have been removed and he is able to walk normally.\n\nRoxanne exchanges promise rings with boyfriend Lenny, and goes on tour with him before returning home. Later on, she dates Meg's ex-boyfriend, Luke. Meg dates a college boy, Drew, despite JJ and her father's strong dislike for him, but breaks it off when he ends up cheating on her.\n\nSam wins a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. Jack decides to run for the [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]]. In the season finale on April 4, 2004, Sam's cousin Nathan is drafted and opts to go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Also in that episode, JJ is caught in a fierce [[battle|firefight]], while Meg and Sam are arrested at a campus rally protesting the Vietnam war.\n\n===Season 3 (2004\u201305)===\nThe arrests widen the communications gap between parents and children, and inspire Meg to lead additional protests. A strict new headmaster also fires Meg up. An injured JJ wakes up in an American military hospital, and learns of his forthcoming child; Beth refuses to accept JJ's offer of marriage. Roxanne, estranged from her mother, moves in with the Pryors. JJ gets recruited for special, somewhat mysterious duty for the US government. Jack wins an upset victory for the City Council.\n\nAs Thanksgiving nears closer, JJ is captured by the Viet Cong. He and his sergeant escape, but are presumed missing in action (the sergeant is later found buried in a shallow grave). The Pryors learn of JJ's \"Missing In Action\" status just before Thanksgiving.\n\nLuke Foley returns to Philadelphia, and Roxanne, who moves out on her remarrying mother, moves in with him in a loft above the Vinyl Crocodile record store.\n\nOn a commercial-free special episode that aired November 21, 2004, JJ returns home. At episode's end he glares harshly at his mother. In the next original episode, JJ becomes a Marine recruiter and suffers from post-traumatic flashbacks. He proposes to Beth. Beth and JJ are married on the January 23, 2005 episode. Helen becomes involved with a Catholic peace group.\n\nAs the show enters 1966, JJ marries Beth in a ceremony held at the Pryors' catholic church. Jack Pryor, newly elected to the Philadelphia City Council, is forced to take a bribe, with the money going to help JJ repay some gambling debts. Eventually Jack votes to elect a local activist in his district, Reverend Davis, to the Police Review Board essentially voting against the Council. For this act of disloyalty, several members of the police force beat up JJ after a traffic stop. Pete soon finds the culprits who attacked JJ and roughs them up, but Jack decides to resign from the Council.\n\nChris and Meg's relationship becomes more intimate, but Meg is troubled by reports that Chris helped set fire to a recruitment center. Despite this, Meg and Chris eventually have sex\u2014with Chris revealing afterward that he did indeed lie to Meg about the recruitment center. Meg and Chris eventually break up, and Chris leaves Philadelphia.\n\nMeg and Sam consider the possibility of a romantic relationship, but JJ and Nathan discourage the idea. Meanwhile, Jack and Pete's older brother Ted gets into a serious car accident, putting him on a respirator. After much soul searching, the Pryors decide to disconnect the machine. After returning home from a Rolling Stones concert, Meg finds her ex-boyfriend Chris standing in front of her home. He's just been drafted.\n\nIn the season/series finale, Meg and Chris both leave Philadelphia on Chris' motorcycle, with plans for them to live in [[Berkeley, California]] and campaign against the war. JJ Pryor applies for and receives a job in aeronautics, assisting in space suit design for future [[NASA]] missions to the moon.\n\n==Timeline of events in the series==\n\n===\"Past\" events===\n*c. 1920 - Jack Pryor is born.\n*c. 1927 - Helen Dolan is born.\n*c.

In the third season, the show was regularly beaten in the Sunday night ratings by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' and [[CBS]]'s ''[[Cold Case]]''. On February 2, 2005, NBC reduced the number of third-season episodes of ''American Dreams'' from 19 to 17. The network also moved the program away from its original Sunday night timeslot to Wednesday nights, airing before ''[[The West Wing]]''. This put the show up against [[CBS]]'s ''[[Survivor: Palau]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and ''American Dreams'' could not compete against these popular programs.\n\nAs the third season wound down, actors on the show filmed pilots for new shows to possibly air in the 2005\u201306 television season. Fans of ''American Dreams'' organized a campaign to save the show, sending over 5000 supportive e-mails to NBC after the season finale and several thousand postcards to the network as well. On May 4, 2005, fans flew an aerial banner over NBC's Burbank studios in support of the show, even as the show's sets were being dismantled at Sunset-Gower Studios, where it was filmed.\n\nIt had been reported that ''American Dreams'' may have been canceled as early as December 2004. Jonathan Prince mentioned in a ''Miami Herald'' article that he was able to get four additional episodes made by having companies such as Kraft and Nabisco pay for additional episodes in exchange for product placement (Campbell's Soups and Ford also participated in product placement episodes).\n\n==Series epilogue==\n''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported on April 12, 2005 that in late February, [[NBC]] ordered two endings filmed for the season finale.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/11370090.htm |title=At Philly.com (Broken Link) |website=philly.com |access-date=2005-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904225249/http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/11370090.htm |archive-date=2006-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> The un-aired ending was reported to be a 12-minute segment set on July 20, 1969 (the day [[Apollo 11]] landed on the [[Moon]]), with Meg returning home to face her family after a three-year absence.\n\nNBC opted not to air the 12-minute epilogue when the third-season finale aired on March 30, 2005, a month and a half before the official cancellation of the series. ''[[TV Guide]]'' reported on July 26, 2005 that this epilogue was likely to air in a rerun of the third-season finale in August or September, but the airing never materialized. NBC was unable to attract sponsorship for the segment, which reportedly contained many rock-and-roll oldies, resulting in expensive music licensing fees for the network.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=153240 |title=The Final Update on the Finale:\"officially DOA\" (10/5) - Sitcoms Online Message Boards - Forums |website=sitcomsonline.com |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102238/http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=153240 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the second annual [[ATX Television Festival]] on June 9, 2013, the cast and crew of the show were reunited, and creator Jonathan Prince unveiled for the first time to both the cast and audience, a rough cut of the never-before-seen epilogue.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2013/06/09/american-dreams-reunion-alternate-ending-atx-festival/ |title=\u2018American Dreams\u2019 Reunion \u2014 Alternate Ending Spoilers - TVLine |last=Megan Masters |website=TVLine |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024339/http://tvline.com/2013/06/09/american-dreams-reunion-alternate-ending-atx-festival/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Prudom\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/american-dreams-reunion-unaired-ending_n_3413896.html |title=How 'American Dreams' Was Supposed To End |last=Prudom |first=Laura |date=June 10, 2013 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=June 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616062059/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/american-dreams-reunion-unaired-ending_n_3413896.html |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the epilogue, a long-haired Meg is seen on a bus (with a caption reading \"Three Years Later\"). After a couple of fellow hippie travelers inquire about the purpose of her trip, Meg reveals that she's planning to attend Woodstock with Sam (who had just graduated from college), and has traveled upstate early in order to meet up with him. Meg also reveals that she still lives in Berkeley, and hasn't been back home since she left with Chris three years prior. Meg is also planning on staying in New York with Roxanne, who is now married to Luke and has a baby boy named Dustin. Meg later reveals that Patty has graduated from high school and is now attending college at Harvard's sister school, Radcliffe. Throughout her time on the bus (and her conversation with the hippies), Meg reflects on her experiences with her family and friends.\n\nAfter the hippies leave, Meg is seen pensively staring out of the bus window. The next moment, Meg is standing outside of her former home in Philadelphia, having taken a detour from heading to New York. She runs into her nephew Trip (who is now much older), who tells her that he knows who she is (based on family photos). When asked, she tells him that she came because she wanted to see her family. Trip tells her that everyone is inside, watching the first ever moon landing (placing the epilogue on July 20, 1969, the day [[Apollo 11]] landed on the [[Moon]]). Tripp reveals that JJ now has a job building space suits for astronauts. Suddenly, Jack (Meg's father) comes out and calls for Trip to come in, when he sees Meg. Trip goes inside, and Helen (Meg's mother) comes outside calling for Jack, but stops when she sees Meg.\n\nAn awkward silence passes among the three, until Jack invites Meg inside for leftovers. Jack enters the house as Meg walks up and grabs Helen in a hug, while Jack looks on from inside.

Several historic events were restaged earlier or later in the show's timeline to fit a plotline, and some of the music and pop culture references do not match up with either historic fact or the show's current timeline. Several arguments between the show's loyal fanbase can be traced to whether the show should be viewed as a chronologically accurate representation of life in 1960s Philadelphia, or is instead an idealized combination of mnemonic images and pop culture references from points throughout the 1960s, much as the film ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' was for the 1980s.\n\nSome examples of these disputes include:\n*A running plotline is the appearance of Meg and Roxanne as dancers on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', which still tapes a daily after-school show in Philadelphia; where in real life the show moved to [[Los Angeles]] in February 1964 and was only broadcast once a week, on Saturday afternoons (in real life, the studio used for ''Bandstand'' was later appropriated by the stations of [[public broadcasting]] operation [[WHYY-TV|WHYY]] after WFIL's donation of them shortly after moving to their new [[City Avenue]] studios).\n*In the pilot episode, Jack makes a reference to [[Ara Parseghian]] and [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]. The pilot was set in November 1963 while Parseghian was hired by Notre Dame in December.\n*In the first year, JJ Pryor Jr supposedly attended [[Lehigh University]] on a football scholarship in 1963 but joined the Marines when injured to pay for college. Lehigh doesn't have athletic scholarships but gives financial grants in aid instead. Thus he would have still had financial aid even if injured.\n*The [[Philadelphia 1964 race riot]] depicted in the first-season finale started at night, not in the daytime, as depicted in the show. Television footage of the riots shown on the episode actually came from the [[Watts riots]] of 1965 Los Angeles.\n*During the show's first season, the music of several artists, such as the [[Kinks]], [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Manfred Mann]], are heard and referenced in 1963, months before the [[Beatles]]' appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (February 1964) that triggered the musical [[British Invasion]].\n*When the Beatles appear on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', the scene is set up so that the first song the Beatles play is \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\", which was the Beatles' first American hit, but was not the first song played on ''Ed Sullivan'' (that honor goes to \"[[All My Loving]]\").\n*In one episode in the show's third season, set in late November 1965, the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|East Coast Blackout]] and the [[Leonid meteor shower]] were both \"rescheduled\" so that they would fall on the same day that Beth Mason gave birth to JJ Pryor's son.\n*In a first-season episode, Meg and Roxanne gush over meeting the group [[Jay and the Americans]], and Roxanne is especially enamored with \"Carl, the drummer\" (the group neither had a member named Carl, nor a drummer, in real life). Also in real life, there were two lead singers known as \"Jay\" - Jay Traynor, who sang on their hit \"She Cried\", and Jay Black, who replaced Traynor for the group's other hits&nbsp;\u2014 yet on the episode, it is assumed that there was only one \"Jay\" who sang all the hits without interruption.\n*In the show's first season, set in November 1963, Meg Pryor and Luke Foley argue over the merits of [[Bob Dylan]], and Luke hands Meg a 45 of Dylan singing \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]].\" In fact, Dylan did not write or perform the song until 1964, and he never released it on a commercial 45 (it appeared on his \"Bringing It All Back Home\" album released in early 1965), although the Byrds' rendition of it was a hit single. Note that before Luke hands meg the Dylan record, he specifically says that it is \"an advanced copy of the record that won't be released until next year.\"\n*References are made in the show's second season to [[I Dream of Jeannie]], which was still a year away from premiering. On top of that, \"the big band theme song\" heard, is the one introduced at the beginning of the show's second season (which was a re-creation of the original theme). It was performed & produced by LA guitarist Rick Fleishman, and it also featured LA session drummer [[Paul Goldberg (musician)|Paul Goldberg]]. (It's the one most viewers were familiar with in 1966).\n*[[The Monkees]] perform on the ''Bandstand'' stage in January 1966, despite their television series not even premiering until September 1966, or the four actors playing the Monkees even performing a live concert until a year later.\n*In an episode set in January/February 1965, [[Nancy Sinatra]] (Jennifer Love Hewitt) appears on American Bandstand to sing \"[[These Boots are Made for Walking]]\" despite the fact the song was not released until 1966.\n*While working at the space suit company, JJ Pryor meets [[Gus Grissom]], and they discuss the [[Apollo 1]] mission. Grissom later says, \"Get me back to [[Cape Canaveral]].\" In reality, the [[Apollo 1]] mission was not designated by that number or name until after the accident that claimed the lives of Grissom and two other astronauts (at the time the mission was known as Apollo/Saturn 204), and the reference to [[Cape Canaveral]] would have been wrong, as the area where the space center was located had been renamed \"Cape Kennedy\" during the 1960s. While the town was officially renamed back to [[Cape Canaveral]] in 1973, the space center was (and still is) known as the Kennedy Space Center, and at least three years had passed since the town was renamed from Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy; so although it is not impossible that in a casual conversation Grissom would have used the traditional name, it is still unlikely that this would happen.\n*Artists such as [[Blake Shelton]], [[John Ondrasik]] and [[Joss Stone]] are allowed to perform their current pop hits, which in real time would have been 40 years away from ever existing.\n*Neither [[The Who]] nor [[Ricky Nelson]] ever performed on the ''Bandstand'' stage in real life (Nelson's father Ozzie refused to allow his performing son to appear on anybody else's TV series, even if such appearance might help increase record sales); but that didn't stop the producers from staging performances by those artists in this series.\n*The Who is shown performing on Bandstand in the show's third season, set in 1965\u20131966. However The Who's first performance in the United States wasn't until the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967.\n*In an episode that is supposedly taking place in the spring of 1965, two customers at the TV store, played by ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' actors [[John Aniston]] and [[Frances Reid]], were watching an episode of ''Days of our Lives'' on a TV (Frances was watching herself on an early episode). ''Days of our Lives'' did not premiere until November 8, 1965.\n*In an episode purporting to take place in the summer of 1966, a character on \"American Bandstand\" is asked to rate the [[Rolling Stones]]' song \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\", despite the song being over a year old.\n*In a late third-season episode, Meg, Roxanne and Luke sit outside Connie Mack Stadium with lawn chairs, listening for free to the Rolling Stones, who are playing a live concert at the stadium. Luke makes a reference that he heard a Bob Dylan concert at Connie Mack Stadium for free this way. Bob Dylan did not play Connie Mack Stadium as an outdoor venue in 1966 or earlier.\n*In another third-season episode that takes place in June 1966, [[the Mamas and the Papas]] appear on [[American Bandstand]] to perform \"[[California Dreamin']]\". However, the Mamas and Papas actual appearance on the show was in February 1966, they did not appear again in June of that year.\n*Characters are depicted as listening to [[Cream (Band)|Cream's]] \"[[I Feel Free]]\" and [[The Spencer Davis Group]]'s \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" as early as the summer of 1965, despite neither song being released until late in 1966, after the timeline of the series had ended.\n\n==Home media==\nThe first season of ''American Dreams'' was released on [[DVD]] in September 2004. As of January no formal release dates have been announced for the remaining two seasons. Prince has promised that the series [[epilogue]] will appear in the third-season DVD release.
