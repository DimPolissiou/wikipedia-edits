Each slot has a probability of being clicked of <math>\\alpha_i</math>. We can assume that top slots have a larger probability of being clicked, so:\n\n: <math>\\alpha_1 \\geq \\alpha_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq \\alpha_k. \\, </math>\n\nWe can think of <math>n-k</math> additional virtual slots with click-through-rate zero, so, <math>\\alpha_m = 0</math> for <math>k<m \\leq n</math>. Now, each bidder submits a bid  <math>b_i</math> indicating the maximum they are willing to pay for a slot.  Each bidder also has an intrinsic value for buying a slot <math>v_i</math>. Notice that a player's '''bid'''  <math>b_i</math> doesn't need to be the same as their '''true valuation''' <math>v_i</math>.  \nWe order the bidders by their bid, let's say:\n\n: <math>b_1 \\geq b_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq b_n, \\, </math>\n\nand charge each bidder a price <math>p_i</math>. The price will be 0 if they didn't win a slot.   Slots are sold in a [[pay-per-click]] model, so a bidder just pays for a slot if the user actually clicks in that slot. We say the '''utility''' of bidder <math>i</math> who is allocated to slot <math>i</math> is <math>u_i = \\alpha_i (v_i - p_i)</math>. The total [[Social welfare function|social welfare]] from owning or selling all slots is given by: <math>SW=\\sum_i \\alpha_i v_i.</math> The expected total revenue is given by: <math>TR=\\sum_i \\alpha_i p_i.</math>\n\n== GSP mechanism ==\n\nTo specify a [[Mechanism design|mechanism]] we need to define the allocation rule (who gets which slot) and the prices paid by each bidder. In a generalized second-price auction we order the bidders by their bid and give the top slot to the highest bidder, the second top slot to the second highest bidder and so on. Then, assuming the bids are listed in decreasing order <math>b_1 \\geq b_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq b_n, \\, </math> the bidder bidding <math>b_i</math> gets slot <math>i</math> for <math>1 \\leq i \\leq k</math>.   Each bidder winning a slot pays the bid of the next highest bidder, so: <math>p_i = b_{i+1}</math>.\n\n== Non-truthfulness ==\n\nThere are cases where bidding the true valuation is not a [[Nash equilibrium]]. For example, consider two slots with <math>\\alpha_1 = 1</math> and <math>\\alpha_2 = 0.4</math> and three bidders with valuations <math>v_1 = 7</math>, <math>v_2 = 6</math> and <math>v_3 = 1</math> and bids \n<math>b_1 = 7</math>, <math>b_2 = 6</math> and <math>b_3 = 1</math> respectively. Thus, <math>p_1=b_2=6</math>, and <math>p_2=b_3=1</math>. The utility for bidder <math>1</math> is  <math>u_1 = \\alpha_1 (v_1 - p_1)= 1(7-6)=1. </math>  This set of bids is not a Nash equilibrium, since the first bidder could lower their bid to 5 and get the second slot for the price of 1, increasing their utility to <math>0.4(5-1)=1.6</math>.\n\n== Equilibria of GSP ==\n\nEdelman, Ostrovsky and Schwarz,<ref name=\"eos\"/> working under complete information, show that GSP (in the model presented above) always has an efficient locally-envy free equilibrium, i.e., an equilibrium maximizing social welfare, which is measured as <math>SW = \\sum_i \\alpha_i v_i</math> where bidder <math>i</math> is allocated slot <math>i</math> according to the decreasing bid vector <math>(b_1, \\dots, b_n)</math>. Further, the expected total revenue in any locally-envy free equilibrium is at least as high as in the (truthful) [[VCG]] outcome.\n\nBounds on the welfare at Nash equilibrium are given by Caragiannis et al.,<ref name=\"cetal\" /> proving a [[price of anarchy]] bound of <math>1.282</math>.

It is connected to [[Funen]] by the [[Great Belt Fixed Link]], to [[Lolland]], [[Falster]] (and Germany from 2028) by the [[Storstr\u00f8m Bridge]] and the [[Far\u00f8 Bridges]]. Zealand is also linked to [[Amager]] by several bridges.

''Sj\u00e6l'' in Danish today means \"soul\", but based on older records one can exclude this interpretation. Even a derivation derived from ''si\u00f4 / s\u00e6'' (meaning \"sea\") corresponding closely to the English name is today largely rejected \u2013 but it could be speculated that the English came up with their own separate name prior to the start of Danish research on the name's origin, and may have caused people thinking Sj\u00e6lland means Zealand. The prevailing view today is: The Old Danish form \"Si\u00e2land\" comes from a composition of the word *''selha-'' with the ending *''wundia-''. The latter means \"indicates, resembles\". The word *''selha-'' can have two different meanings: it can mean on the one hand \"seal\" (in modern Danish ''s\u00e6l'') and on the other hand mean \"deep bay, fjord\". Since the main settlement on Zealand was previously Roskilde, which is only accessible by sea through the narrow [[Roskilde Fjord]] (branched from the [[Ise Fjord]]), it is usually assumed that the sailors named the island after this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sprogmuseet.dk/ordhistorier/sj%C3%A6lland/|title=Sj\u00e6lland \u2026|last=Katlev|first=Jan|date=4 August 2009|website=www.sprogmuseet.dk|language=Danish|publisher=Danish Language Museum|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Mythological origins==\n[[File:Gefion.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gefion Fountain|Gefion]] carving Zealand from [[Sweden]].]]\nIn [[Norse mythology]] as told in the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the island was created by the goddess [[Gefjon|Gefjun]] after she tricked [[Gylfi]], the king of Sweden.

It is irregularly shaped, and is north of the islands of [[Lolland]], [[Falster]], and [[M\u00f8n]]. The small island of Amager lies immediately east.\n\nCopenhagen is mostly on Zealand but extends across northern Amager. A number of bridges and the [[Copenhagen Metro]] connect Zealand to Amager, which is connected to [[Scania]] in [[Sweden]] by the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] via the artificial island of [[Peberholm]]. Zealand is joined in the west to Funen, by the Great Belt Fixed Link, and Funen is connected by bridges to the country's mainland, [[Jutland]].\n\nOn June 5, 2007, the regional subsidiary of national broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] reported that [[Kobanke]] in the southeast near the town [[R\u00f8nnede]] in [[Faxe Municipality]], with a height of {{convert|122.9|m}}, was the highest natural point on Zealand. [[Gyldenl\u00f8vesh\u00f8j]], south of the city [[Roskilde]], has a height of {{convert|126|m}}, but that is due to a man-made hill from the [[17th century]] and its highest natural point is only {{convert|121.3|m}}.\n\nZealand gives its name to the [[Selandian]] era of the [[Paleocene]].\n\n==Cities and towns==\n[[Urban area]]s with 10,000+ inhabitants:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!

They took several Infinity Ward employees with them to their new company, leaving Activision with about half the staff and a deadline of about 20 months (versus a typical 24 months) to complete the next game in the franchise, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. Activision requested that Sledgehammer Games stop work on the third-person shooter and collaborate with Infinity Ward instead.<ref name=\"Digital Trends profile\" />\n\nThe offer was a gamble for both sides. Activision was calling on a studio that had not put out a game on its own, while Sledgehammer Games would be abandoning weeks of work in the genre they were most familiar with to take on a punishing schedule in a high-profile franchise. Infinity Ward was more likely to receive credit for any success while Sledgehammer Games was apt to be blamed for any failure. The studio first polled its staff and got unanimous approval. \"It was a massive risk for Schofield and Condrey's new studio, and one that most outside of the industry never considered\", wrote Ryan Fleming in ''Digital Trends''. \"The Infinity Ward name was the marquis on the ''Modern Warfare'' franchise, but failure to deliver on Activision's golden egg would have resulted in a wave that crippled those in its path. Looking back at the success of that game and franchise as a whole, it is easy to overlook the chance Sledgehammer took.\"<ref name=\"Digital Trends profile\" />\n\nThe collaboration with Infinity Ward marked the first time a co-development relationship would produce a ''Modern Warfare'' title, with both companies' logos appearing on the packaging. Despite the companies\u2019 differing histories and development methodologies, ''[[GamesTM]]'' called the arrangement a rare symbiotic relationship for such a high-profile game. The two teams first met in the spring of 2010 to compare ideas. There was some overlap: both teams wanted to set the game in Europe and, recalled Schofield, achieve a \u201cpayoff on the story that had been told over the last four years.\u201d<ref name=GamesTM />\n\nIt was announced in February 2014 that Sledgehammer Games would be developing a new ''Call of Duty'' title, slated for release in late 2014. On May 1, ''[[Game Informer]]'' teased a high resolution image of a soldier wearing an exo-skeleton suit. It was also announced that more details, the cover, the full name, and a trailer would be released on May 4.

The collaboration carried forward to ''Dead Space''.

Activision sat on the proposal for weeks until [[Activision Blizzard]] CEO [[Bobby Kotick]] offered to bring the studio into the Activision fold. Schofield and Condrey accepted, viewing Activision's independent studio model as an opportunity to preserve the company's creative culture, development methodology and staff, while having the security of an alliance with the industry's largest publisher.<ref name=\"Digital Trends profile\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot CODMW3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/videos/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-feature-who-is-sledgehammer-games-6331882/|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Feature: Who is Sledgehammer Games?|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=November 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414180615/http://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/videos/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-feature-who-is-sledgehammer-games-6331882/|archive-date=April 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Industrygamers>{{cite news|last=Brightman|first=James|url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/better-know-sledgehammers-michael-condrey-and-glen-schofield|title=Better Know Sledgehammer's Michael Condrey and Glen Schofield|accessdate=November 6, 2012|newspaper=Industrygamers|date=November 8, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130200114/http://www.industrygamers.com/news/better-know-sledgehammers-michael-condrey-and-glen-schofield|archivedate=January 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSledgehammer Games spent six to eight months working on the ''Call of Duty'' project in 2009, enough to produce a prototype with about 15 minutes of play.<ref name=GamesTM>{{cite news|title=The Art of Modern War|url=http://www.gamestm.co.uk/magazine-issues/gamestm-issue-113/|accessdate=November 16, 2012|newspaper=GamesTM|date=September 2011|issue=113|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015122230/http://www.gamestm.co.uk/magazine-issues/gamestm-issue-113/|archive-date=October 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The game would have reportedly extended the franchise into the action-adventure genre, but a legal battle between [[Infinity Ward]], the studio behind the ''Modern Warfare'' franchise, and co-founders Jason West and Vince Zampella resulted in the pair's departure. They took several Infinity Ward employees with them to their new company, leaving Activision with about half the staff and a deadline of about 20 months (versus a typical 24 months) to complete the next game in the franchise, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. Activision requested that Sledgehammer Games stop work on the third-person shooter and collaborate with Infinity Ward instead.<ref name=\"Digital Trends profile\" />\n\nThe offer was a gamble for both sides. Activision was calling on a studio that had not put out a game on its own, while Sledgehammer Games would be abandoning weeks of work in the genre they were most familiar with to take on a punishing schedule in a high-profile franchise. Infinity Ward was more likely to receive credit for any success while Sledgehammer Games was apt to be blamed for any failure. The studio first polled its staff and got unanimous approval. \"It was a massive risk for Schofield and Condrey's new studio, and one that most outside of the industry never considered\", wrote Ryan Fleming in ''Digital Trends''. \"The Infinity Ward name was the marquis on the ''Modern Warfare'' franchise, but failure to deliver on Activision's golden egg would have resulted in a wave that crippled those in its path. Looking back at the success of that game and franchise as a whole, it is easy to overlook the chance Sledgehammer took.\"<ref name=\"Digital Trends profile\" />\n\nThe collaboration with Infinity Ward marked the first time a co-development relationship would produce a ''Modern Warfare'' title, with both companies' logos appearing on the packaging. Despite the companies\u2019 differing histories and development methodologies, ''[[GamesTM]]'' called the arrangement a rare symbiotic relationship for such a high-profile game. The two teams first met in the spring of 2010 to compare ideas. There was some overlap: both teams wanted to set the game in Europe and, recalled Schofield, achieve a \u201cpayoff on the story that had been told over the last four years.\u201d<ref name=GamesTM />\n\nIt was announced in February 2014 that Sledgehammer Games would be developing a new ''Call of Duty'' title, slated for release in late 2014. On May 1, ''[[Game Informer]]'' teased a high resolution image of a soldier wearing an exo-skeleton suit. It was also announced that more details, the cover, the full name, and a trailer would be released on May 4. However the trailer was leaked which confirmed the release of ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' on November 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Activision confirms 3-year dev cycle for the Call of Duty franchise; SHGames game coming in 2014|url=http://www.charlieintel.com/2014/02/06/activision-confirms-3-dev-cycle-for-the-call-of-duty-franchise-shgames-game-coming-in-2014/|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420183547/http://charlieintel.com/2014/02/06/activision-confirms-3-dev-cycle-for-the-call-of-duty-franchise-shgames-game-coming-in-2014/|archive-date=April 20, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2017, Sledgehammer Games and Activision announced their next ''Call of Duty'' game, titled ''[[Call of Duty: WWII]]''.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with a difficult economic context, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally (marking the end of the civil war in France) prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half-brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois.

The city of [[Vannes]] in Brittany changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}  The English-backed Montfort finally succeeded in taking the duchy but not until 1364.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |title=Auray, France |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |access-date=2018-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415064637/https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |archive-date=15 April 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Cr\u00e9cy and the taking of Calais===\n[[File:Cr\u00e9cy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], 1346, from the [[Grandes Chroniques de France]].

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55\u201345}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347.

He offered terms of peace to King [[John II of France]] (known as John the Good), who had outflanked him near Poitiers, but refused to surrender himself as the price of their acceptance.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile.

The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot.

The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]].

They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France.

Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence.

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]]. While there, it became apparent that he was ill (possibly [[dysentery]]), and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}} The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October 1422.

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\n==French victory: 1429\u20131453==\n\n===Joan of Arc and French revival===\n[[File:Contemporaine afb jeanne d arc.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Joan of Arc]] (picture 1429)]]\n\nThe appearance of [[Joan of Arc]] at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The English laid [[siege]] to Orl\u00e9ans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully [[investment (military)|invest]] the city. In 1429 Joan persuaded the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\nBy 1449, the French had retaken [[Rouen]].

Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]].

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further.

Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures.

The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own.

The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with a difficult economic context, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of Henry V, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally marking the end of the civil war in France prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, a series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half-brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois.

The city of [[Vannes]] in Brittany changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}  The English-backed Montfort finally succeeded in taking the duchy but not until 1364.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |title=Auray, France |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |access-date=2018-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415064637/https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |archive-date=15 April 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Cr\u00e9cy and the taking of Calais===\n[[File:Cr\u00e9cy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], 1346, from the [[Grandes Chroniques de France]].

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55\u201345}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347.

He offered terms of peace to King [[John II of France]] (known as John the Good), who had outflanked him near Poitiers, but refused to surrender himself as the price of their acceptance.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England.

The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 but failed to reignite the war in France.

Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms.

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]].

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further.

Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures.

The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own.

They named their company Musket Corporation. Over the next eight years, Musket opened 40 additional gas stations. All of them operated under the [[Kerr-McGee]] gasoline brand.\n\nWhen the [[1973 oil crisis|fuel crunch]] of the early 1970s began and gasoline was in short supply in the United States, Tom Love diversified for the sake of the company's success. He launched a new concept in Watonga: the \"Mini Stop Country Store\". By adding a grocery line to their self-service fuel sales, Musket became one of the nation's first{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} to offer one-stop shopping for travelers. The Mini Stop was successful and the company quickly opened more stores in western Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1972, Musket set out to convert all of its locations from gas stations to convenience stores with self-serve gasoline. By 1973, the company began using the family name to identify its locations. Love's Country Stores was the new name.\n\nBy 1978, Love's Country Stores had 60 locations in small communities throughout Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. That year, the company began offering the Fresh Daily Deli, sandwiches made fresh daily on-location. Food service became the company's third profit center in each location, along with self-serve gasoline and convenience store items. The Fresh Daily Deli is branded today as Love's Subs.\n\nBy the end of 1981, the company reached a milestone with 100 Love's Country Stores locations in operation. The in-store decor was changed from the previous dark country look to a brighter theme. The same year, it opened the first Love's Travel Stop on [[Interstate 40]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. The travel stop opened a new [[target audience]] to Love's business; the addition of self-serve diesel fuel brought [[Truck driver|professional drivers]] to Love's. The Travel Stop was unique in that it served both the professional driver ''and'' the motoring public, resulting in more growth for Love's.\n\nIn 1985, Love's added gifts and novelties. Then in 1993, [[Taco Bell]] became a partner, opening a co-branded location in Oklahoma City. The success of this partnership quickly grew.\n\nIn 1995, the company opened its first triple-branded food service operation in [[El Paso, Texas]]. The location offered [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Taco Bell Express]] and [[Pizza Hut]].\n\nIn the late 1990s, food service continued to grow. Soon the company was partnering with an array of co-branded restaurant concepts, including [[Arby's]], [[Baskin Robbins]], [[Bojangles']], [[Burger King]], [[Carl's Jr.]], Chester's, [[Dairy Queen]], [[Del Taco]], [[Denny's]], [[Dunkin' Donuts]], [[Godfather's Pizza]], [[Green Burrito]], [[Hardee's]], [[IHOP Express]], [[McDonald's]], [[Sonic (restaurant)|Sonic]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Taco Bell]], [[Taco John's]] and [[Wendy's]].\n\n[[File:Trucks at a Love's.jpg|thumb|Love's Travel Stop]]In 2000, [[Sales & Marketing Executives International]] awarded Love's the 2000 Outlook Award, for innovation and outstanding contribution to the future of the convenience store industry.\n\nThe first truck tire care location opened in 2008, and since then, the business has grown into a nationwide network of centers, offering tires, equipment, light mechanical work, oil changes and roadside service.\n\nOn June 30, 2010, Love's acquired 20 [[Pilot Flying J|Pilot Travel Centers]] locations and six [[FJ Management|Flying J]] locations out of [[antitrust]] concerns in order for the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to approve the Pilot/Flying J merger.<ref>{{cite web |author=Username * |url=http://www.csnews.com/top-story-pilot__flying_j_finalize_merger-56010.html |title=Pilot, Flying J Finalize Merger |publisher=CSNews |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2014-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712192841/http://www.csnews.com/top-story-pilot__flying_j_finalize_merger-56010.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, Love's opened its first location in Montana, its 41st state of operation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Love's Welcomes Customers at First Montana Location|url=http://www.csnews.com/industry-news-and-trends/corporate-store-operations/loves-welcomes-customers-first-montana-location|accessdate=June 23, 2017|work=Convenience Store News|date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> At the time, Love's operated more than 430 stores.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roberts-McMurray|first=KayLynn|title=New Love's truck stop ready to open|url=http://www.elynews.com/2017/06/23/new-loves-truck-stop-ready-open/|accessdate=June 23, 2017|work=The Ely Times|date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLove's Travel Stops & Country Stores entered into an agreement with the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] on March 15, 2019.

The Travel Stop was unique in that it served both the professional driver ''and'' the motoring public, resulting in more growth for Love's.\n\nIn 1985, Love's added gifts and novelties. Then in 1993, [[Taco Bell]] became a partner, opening a co-branded location in Oklahoma City. The success of this partnership quickly grew.\n\nIn 1995, the company opened its first triple-branded food service operation in [[El Paso, Texas]]. The location offered [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Taco Bell Express]] and [[Pizza Hut]].\n\nIn the late 1990s, food service continued to grow. Soon the company was partnering with an array of co-branded restaurant concepts, including [[Arby's]], [[Baskin Robbins]], [[Bojangles']], [[Burger King]], [[Carl's Jr.]], Chester's, [[Dairy Queen]], [[Del Taco]], [[Denny's]], [[Dunkin' Donuts]], [[Godfather's Pizza]], [[Green Burrito]], [[Hardee's]], [[IHOP Express]], [[McDonald's]], [[Sonic (restaurant)|Sonic]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Taco Bell]], [[Taco John's]] and [[Wendy's]].\n\n[[File:Trucks at a Love's.jpg|thumb|Love's Travel Stop]]In 2000, [[Sales & Marketing Executives International]] awarded Love's the 2000 Outlook Award, for innovation and outstanding contribution to the future of the convenience store industry.\n\nThe first truck tire care location opened in 2008, and since then, the business has grown into a nationwide network of centers, offering tires, equipment, light mechanical work, oil changes and roadside service.\n\nOn June 30, 2010, Love's acquired 20 [[Pilot Flying J|Pilot Travel Centers]] locations and six [[FJ Management|Flying J]] locations out of [[antitrust]] concerns in order for the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to approve the Pilot/Flying J merger.<ref>{{cite web |author=Username * |url=http://www.csnews.com/top-story-pilot__flying_j_finalize_merger-56010.html |title=Pilot, Flying J Finalize Merger |publisher=CSNews |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2014-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712192841/http://www.csnews.com/top-story-pilot__flying_j_finalize_merger-56010.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, Love's opened its first location in Montana, its 41st state of operation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Love's Welcomes Customers at First Montana Location|url=http://www.csnews.com/industry-news-and-trends/corporate-store-operations/loves-welcomes-customers-first-montana-location|accessdate=June 23, 2017|work=Convenience Store News|date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> At the time, Love's operated more than 430 stores.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roberts-McMurray|first=KayLynn|title=New Love's truck stop ready to open|url=http://www.elynews.com/2017/06/23/new-loves-truck-stop-ready-open/|accessdate=June 23, 2017|work=The Ely Times|date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLove's Travel Stops & Country Stores entered into an agreement with the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] on March 15, 2019.
