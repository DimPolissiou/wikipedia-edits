Among his or her 100 or so statutory duties, the secretary of state is responsible for filing [[oath of office|oaths of office]] and [[title deeds|deeds]] for state lands; for issuing [[Apostille Convention|apostilles]] and [[notary public|notary]] authentications; for compiling and preserving the original copies of laws and resolutions; for the safekeeping of all [[enrolled bill rule|enrolled laws and resolutions]]; and for \u201cthe custody of all books, records, deeds, bonds, parchments, maps, papers and other articles and effects belonging to the state, deposited or kept in the secretary of state's office, and make such provision for the arrangement and preservation thereof as is necessary, and keep the same, together with all accounts and transactions of the office open at all times to the inspection and examination of the governor or any committee of either or both houses of the legislature.\u201d<ref>https://www.sos.state.wi.us/</ref><ref>https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/14/III/38/5</ref><ref>https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/14/III/38/3</ref><ref>https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/14/III/38/6</ref> Likewise, the secretary of state receives and files the signature and an impression of the official seal of the [[municipal clerk|county clerks]] and [[recorder of deeds|registers of deeds]] in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties, maintains a record of all appointments in each legislative, executive and judicial state agency, and receives, preserves and makes available for inspection all [[conveyances]], [[abstract of title|abstracts of title]], [[option (finance)|options]] and [[lease|leases]] of public land; and, unless otherwise directed by law, all [[bond (finance)|bonds]], [[mortgage|mortgages]] and other [[security|securities]], for money, for which the State of [[Wisconsin]] is a party.<ref>https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/14/III/38/9m</ref><ref>https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/14/III/40</ref><ref>https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/14/III/43</ref><ref>https://www.sos.state.wi.us/</ref>\n\nThe secretary of state is second in the [[order of succession]] to the office of the [[governor of Wisconsin]]; under the current terms of the constitution, if the governor dies, resigns or is removed from office and the office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin|lieutenant governor]] is vacant, the secretary of state becomes governor, whereas in the vacancy of the lieutenant governorship and the absence from the state, impeachment or inability to serve due to illness, the secretary of state merely becomes acting governor.  These terms came into effect with an amendment to the constitution in 1979; originally, in all of these events, the secretary of state simply became acting governor.<ref name=\"article5\">{{cite book |editor=Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau |title=State of Wisconsin 2007&ndash;2008 Blue Book |chapter=Chapter 3: Wisconsin Constitution (Article V) |chapterurl=http://www.legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/bb/07bb/constitution.htm |location=Madison |publisher=Wisconsin Legislature Joint Committee on Legislative Organization |year=2007 |page=214 |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> While Secretaries of State have at times briefly acted as governor, none have ever become governor, or acted as governor in circumstances that would have caused them to become governor had the 1979 amendment been in effect at the time.<ref name=\"bluebook2007\" />\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of Secretaries of State of Wisconsin]]\n*[[Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{WISecretariesOfState}}\n{{U.S. State Secretaries of State}}\n{{Wisconsin constitutional officers}}\n\n[[Category:Secretaries of State of Wisconsin|*]]\n[[Category:State constitutional officers of Wisconsin|Secretary of state]]\n", "name_user": "Asdasdasdff", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Wisconsin"}

Route 92 was also assigned in the [[1953 renumbering (New Jersey)|1953 renumbering]] and by the late 1950s it was named the '''Princeton\u2013Hightstown Bypass''', a freeway planned to connect the [[Somerset Freeway]] (an unbuilt section of Interstate 95) in [[Montgomery Township, New Jersey|Montgomery Township]] (near [[Skillman, New Jersey|Skillman]]), with [[New Jersey Route 33|Route 33]] in [[East Windsor Township, New Jersey|East Windsor Township]] (east of [[Hightstown, New Jersey|Hightstown]]). In 1987, the planned Route 92 was truncated to only run east from U.S. Route 1 near [[Kingston, New Jersey|Kingston]]. New plans were announced in 1994, this time running to US 1 near [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. After public hearings found opposition was still strong, the planned route was truncated to a much shorter bypass of Hightstown only and numbered Route 133. Construction on the road, the first project awarded under New Jersey's modified [[Design-build]] program, began on September 20, 1996 and was opened November 30, 1999.\n\nThe first plans for Route 92's new alignment, running from exit&nbsp;8A of the New Jersey Turnpike (rather than exit&nbsp;8) west to [[U.S. Route 206]] near [[Rocky Hill, New Jersey|Rocky Hill]], were made in 1988, using funds from the canceled Somerset Freeway. In 1992, the plans were formally transferred to the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]], which announced the new plans in 1994, again dropping the segment west of US 1. All but $6.5 million of the $400 million project was reassigned in November 2005 to widen the Turnpike in southern New Jersey.\n\n== History ==\n=== Princeton\u2013Hightstown alignment ===\n{{see also|New Jersey Route 133|New Jersey Route 64}}\n[[File:NJ Route 64 westbound in autumn.jpg|right|thumb|Route 64, a built portion of the original Route 31-A Freeway, which spawned Route 92]]\nThe first proposed alignments for a freeway from the borough of Princeton to the community of Hightstown originates in the designation of State Highway Route 31-A in 1938 by the New Jersey State Legislature.<ref name=\"1938law\">{{citation|title=ROUTE NO. 31A.

In 1982, the Somerset Freeway was canceled as a project, and the $228 million (1982 USD) that came with it was given around by a partnership, with the New Jersey Department of Transportation suggesting the Route 92 Freeway become one of the six projects to receive funding. Final designs for the freeway were underway in 1986, amid controversy. As a result, the Department of Transportation dropped the section west of [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 1]] in South Brunswick Township only a year later.<ref name=\"pubhearing\"/> After plans for Route 92 were realigned northward in 1988, the Princeton-Hightstown Bypass was revived in 1994 for construction of a new bypass of Hightstown.

After curving to the east, Route 92 was to enter [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro]], cross the [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[Northeast Corridor Line]] and Devil's Brook, and then re-enter South Brunswick.  The route was to continue eastward, passing to the north of McCormack Lake and begin following Friendship Road until the intersection with Miller Road. Route 92 was to turn to the southeast along with Friendship Road and cross through a toll station.

Route 92 was also assigned in the [[1953 renumbering (New Jersey)|1953 renumbering]] and by the late 1950s it was named the '''Princeton\u2013Hightstown Bypass''', a freeway planned to connect the [[Somerset Freeway]] (an unbuilt section of Interstate 95) in [[Montgomery Township, New Jersey|Montgomery Township]] (near [[Skillman, New Jersey|Skillman]]), with [[New Jersey Route 33|Route 33]] in [[East Windsor Township, New Jersey|East Windsor Township]] (east of [[Hightstown, New Jersey|Hightstown]]). In 1987, the planned Route 92 was truncated to only run east from U.S. Route 1 near [[Kingston, New Jersey|Kingston]]. New plans were announced in 1994, this time running to US 1 near [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. After public hearings found opposition was still strong, the planned route was truncated to a much shorter bypass of Hightstown only and numbered Route 133. Construction on the road, the first project awarded under New Jersey's modified [[Design-build]] program, began on September 20, 1996 and was opened November 30, 1999.\n\nThe first plans for Route 92's new alignment, running from exit&nbsp;8A of the New Jersey Turnpike (rather than exit&nbsp;8) west to [[U.S. Route 206]] near [[Rocky Hill, New Jersey|Rocky Hill]], were made in 1988, using funds from the canceled Somerset Freeway. In 1992, the plans were formally transferred to the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]], which announced the new plans in 1994, again dropping the segment west of US 1.

Wainwright''''', 372 U.S. 335 (1963), is a [[landmark decision|landmark case]] in [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] history. In it, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states are required under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] to provide an attorney to defendants in criminal cases who are unable to afford their own attorneys. The case extended the right to counsel, which had been found under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendments]] to impose requirements on the federal government, by imposing those requirements upon the states as well.\n\n==Background==\nBetween midnight and 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on June 3, 1961, a burglary occurred at the Bay Harbor Pool Room in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], [[Florida]]. An unknown person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole money from a cash register. Later that day, a witness reported that he had seen [[Clarence Earl Gideon]] in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a wine bottle, Coke, and change in his pockets. Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty [[larceny]].\n\nGideon appeared in court alone as he was too poor to afford counsel, whereupon the following conversation took place:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/335|title=Gideon v. Wainwright|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''The COURT:'''  Mr. Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot appoint counsel to represent you in this case.  Under the laws of the State of Florida, the only time the court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is when that person is charged with a capital offense.  I am sorry, but I will have to deny your request to appoint counsel to defend you in this case.\n\n'''GIDEON:'''  The United States Supreme Court says I am entitled to be represented by counsel.\n}}\n\nThe court declined to appoint counsel for Gideon. As a result, he was forced to act as his own counsel and conduct his own defense in court, emphasizing his innocence in the case. At the conclusion of the trial the jury returned a guilty verdict.  The court sentenced Gideon to serve five years in the state prison.\n\nFrom his cell at the [[Florida State Prison]] in [[Raiford, Florida|Raiford]], making use of the prison library and writing in pencil on prison stationery,<ref>{{cite book|title=Petition for a Writ of Certiorari from Clarence Gideon to the Supreme Court of the United States, 01/05/1962|url=https://research.archives.gov/description/597554|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=9 November 2014|year=1962|series=File Unit: Appellate Jurisdiction Case File Gideon v. Wainright, 1/8/1962 - 4/12/1963}}</ref> Gideon appealed to the United States Supreme Court in a suit against the Secretary of the [[Florida Department of Corrections]], H. G. Cochran.  Cochran later retired and was replaced with [[Louie L. Wainwright]] before the case was heard by the Supreme Court. Gideon argued in his appeal that he had been denied counsel and, therefore, his Sixth Amendment rights, as applied to the states by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], had been violated.\n\nThe Supreme Court assigned Gideon a prominent [[Washington, D.C.]], attorney, future Supreme Court justice [[Abe Fortas]] of the law firm [[Arnold & Porter|Arnold, Fortas & Porter]]. [[Bruce Jacob]], who later became Dean of the [[Walter F. George School of Law|Mercer University School of Law]] and Dean of [[Stetson University College of Law]], argued the case for Florida.<ref name=\"WDL\"/> Fortas was assisted by longtime Arnold, Fortas & Porter partner Abe Krash and future famed legal scholar [[John Hart Ely]], then a third-year student at [[Yale Law School]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Krash|first=Abe|title=Architects of Gideon: Remembering Abe Fortas and Hugo Black|url=http://www.nacdl.org/Champion/Articles/98mar02.htm|work=The Champion|publisher=NACDL|accessdate=24 October 2013|date=March 1998}}</ref>\n\nDuring oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Fortas repeatedly referenced that the existing framework for a state trial court to appoint counsel was unworkable.<ref name=\"oyez.org\">\"Gideon v. Wainwright.\" Oyez, 6 Dec. 2018, [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155 www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155].</ref> Under the existing framework, a magistrate in a [[preliminary hearing]] made a determination on whether there were \"special circumstances\" in the case which supported that the defendant should receive counsel. However, as Fortas highlighted, that determination occurred too early in the case to be of any use. For example, whether a witness's statement should be barred because it was [[hearsay]] is an extremely complicated issue that no layman could readily confront, and such a situation only arose in the middle of a trial.\n\nAs a second point, Fortas presented during oral argument that it was widely accepted in the legal community, that the first thing any reputable lawyer does when he is accused of a crime is to hire an attorney. In providing an example, Fortas presented the justices with the fact that when [[Clarence Darrow]], who was widely known as the greatest criminal attorney in the United States, was charged with [[jury tampering]] and suborning perjury, the first thing he did was get an attorney to represent him.<ref name=\"oyez.org\"/> Fortas suggested that if a lawyer as prominent as Darrow needed an attorney to represent him in criminal proceedings, then a man without a legal education or any education for that matter needed a lawyer just the same.<ref name=\"oyez.org\"/>\n\n==Court decision==\n[[File:Gideon petition for certiorari.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of Gideon's handwritten petition for a writ of [[certiorari]] to the US Supreme Court.]]\nThe Supreme Court's decision was announced on March 18, 1963, and delivered by Justice [[Hugo Black]]. The decision was announced as being unanimous in favor of Gideon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155|title=Gideon v. Wainwright|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|publisher=Chicago-Kent College of Law at Illinois Tech|access-date=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Two concurring opinions were written by Justices [[Tom C. Clark|Clark]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II|Harlan]]. Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] wrote a separate opinion. The Supreme Court decision specifically cited its previous ruling in ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (1932). Whether or not the decision in ''Powell v. Alabama'' applied to non-capital cases had sparked heated debate. ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'' (1942) had earlier held that, unless certain circumstances were present, such as illiteracy or low intelligence of the defendant, or an especially complicated case, there was no need for a court-appointed attorney in state court criminal proceedings. ''Betts'' had thus provided selective application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the states, depending on the circumstances, as the Sixth Amendment had only been held binding in federal cases. ''Gideon'' overruled ''Betts'', instead holding that the assistance of counsel, if desired by a defendant who could not afford to hire counsel, was a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, binding on the states, and essential for a fair trial and due process of law regardless of the circumstances of the case.\n\nJustice Clark's concurring opinion stated that the Sixth Amendment does not distinguish between capital and non-capital cases, so legal counsel must be provided for an indigent defendant in all cases.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3935/ |title = Clarence Earl Gideon, Petitioner, vs. Louis L. Wainwright, Director, Department of Corrections, Respondent |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1963 |accessdate = 2013-08-03 }}</ref> Justice Harlan's concurring opinion stated that the mere existence of a serious criminal charge in itself constituted special circumstances requiring the services of counsel at trial.\n\n''Gideon v. Wainwright'' was one of a series of Supreme Court decisions that confirmed the right of defendants in criminal proceedings, upon request, to have counsel appointed both during trial and on appeal. In the subsequent cases of ''[[Massiah v. United States]],'' 377 U.S. 201 (1964) and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Supreme Court further extended the rule to apply even during police interrogation.\n\n==Implications==\n\nApproximately 2,000 individuals were freed in Florida alone as a result of the ''Gideon'' decision. The decision did not directly result in Gideon being freed; instead, he received a new trial with the appointment of defense counsel at the government's expense.\n\nGideon chose [[W. Fred Turner]] to be his lawyer in his second trial. The retrial took place on August 5, 1963, five months after the Supreme Court ruling. During the trial, Turner picked apart the testimony of eyewitness Henry Cook. In his opening and closing statements, Turner suggested that Cook likely had been a lookout for a group of young men who broke into the poolroom to steal beer and then grabbed the coins while they were there. Turner also obtained a statement from a cab driver who had taken Gideon from Bay Harbor to a bar in Panama City, stating that Gideon was carrying neither wine, beer, nor Coke when he picked him up, even though Cook testified that he had watched Gideon walk from the pool hall to a payphone and then wait for a cab. This testimony completely discredited Cook.\n\nThe jury acquitted Gideon after one hour of deliberation. After his acquittal, Gideon resumed his previous life and married some time later. He died of cancer in Fort Lauderdale on January 18, 1972, at age 61. Gideon's family in Missouri accepted his body and laid him to rest in an unmarked grave. A granite headstone was added later.<ref name=\"Beaney1963p1153\">{{cite journal |last=Beaney |first=William M. |authorlink=|year=1963 |title=The Right to Counsel: Past, Present, and Future |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1150\u20131159 [p. 1153] |doi=10.2307/1071050|quote=|jstor=1071050 }}</ref> It was inscribed with a quote from a letter Gideon wrote to Abe Fortas, the attorney appointed to represent him in the Supreme Court: \"Each era finds an improvement in law for the benefit of mankind.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Jack|title=Clarence Earl Gideon: Unlikely World-Shaker|url=http://www.nacdl.org/Champion.aspx?id=25000|publisher=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on courts===\nThe former \"incorrect trial\" rule, where the government was given a fair amount of latitude in criminal proceedings as long as there were no \"shocking departures from fair procedure\", was discarded in favor of a firm set of \"procedural guarantees\" based on the Constitution. The court reversed ''Betts'' and adopted rules that did not require a case-by-case analysis, but instead established the requirement of appointed counsel as a matter of right, without a defendant's having to show \"special circumstances\" that justified the appointment of counsel.<ref name=\"Beaney1963p1153\" /> In this way, the case helped to refine ''[[stare decisis]]'': when a prior appellate court decision should be upheld and what standard should be applied to test a new case against case precedent to achieve acceptable practice and due process of law.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Israel |first=Jerold H. |authorlink= |year=1963 |title=''Gideon v.

The decision created and then expanded the need for public defenders which had previously been rare. For example, immediately following the decision, Florida required [[public defenders]] in all of the state's circuit courts.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Gideon's Promise, Still Unkept |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DA1431F93BA25750C0A965958260 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=1993-03-18 |accessdate=2008-08-08 }}</ref> The need for more public defenders also led to a need to ensure that they were properly trained in criminal defense in order to allow defendants to receive as fair a trial as possible. Several states and counties followed suit. Washington D.C., for instance, has created a training program for their public defenders, who must receive rigorous training before they are allowed to represent defendants, and must continue their training in order to remain current in criminal law, procedure, and practices.<ref name=Abel2006>Abel, Laura. \"2006 ''Edward v. Sparer'' Symposium: Civil ''Gideon'': Creating a Constitutional Right to Counsel in the Civil Context: A Right to Counsel in Civil Cases: Lessons from ''Gideon v. Wainwright''\". ''Temple Political & Civil Rights Law Review'', Volume 15. Summer 2006.</ref> In 2010, a public defender's office in the South Bronx, [[The Bronx Defenders]], created the Center for Holistic Defense, which has helped other public defender offices from Montana to Massachusetts, developed a model of public defense called holistic defense or holistic advocacy. In it, criminal defense attorneys work on interdisciplinary teams, alongside civil attorneys, social workers, and legal advocates to help clients with not only direct but also collateral aspects of their criminal cases. More recently the [[American Bar Association]] and the [[National Legal Aid and Defender Association]] have set minimum training requirements, caseload levels, and experience requirements for defenders.<ref name=Abel2006 /> There is often controversy whether caseloads set upon public defenders give them enough time to sufficiently defend their clients. Some criticize the mindset in which public defense lawyers encourage their clients to simply plead guilty. Some defenders say this is intended to lessen their own workload, while others would say it is intended to obtain a lighter sentence by negotiating a plea bargain as compared with going to trial and perhaps having a harsher sentence imposed. Tanya Greene, an ACLU lawyer, has said that that is why 90 to 95 percent of defendants do plead guilty: \"You've got so many cases, limited resources, and there's no relief. You go to work, you get more cases. You have to triage.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/07/how-well-are-the-poor-publicly-defended/ |author=Daniel June |title=How Well are the Poor Publicly Defended? |date=May 7, 2013 |website=jdjournal.com}}</ref>\n\n===Right to counsel===\nThe ''Doughty v. Maxwell'' decision demonstrates the differences between how states and the federal government address standards for waiver of the right to counsel. In this case the Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the decision of the Ohio court in ''Doughty'', which held that regardless of ''Gideon'', the defendant waived his or her right to appointed counsel by entering a plea of guilty. The underlying alleged crime and trial in ''Doughty'' took place in [[Ohio]], which had its own way of interpreting the right to counsel as do many states.  [[Pennsylvania]] and [[West Virginia]] also deemed that the right to counsel was waived when a plea of guilty was entered. Depending upon one's viewpoint, rules such as these could be seen as an attempt by a state to establish reasonable rules in criminal cases or as an attempt to save money even at the expense of denying a defendant due process. This varies a great deal from federal law, which generally has stricter guidelines for waiving the right to counsel. An analogous area of criminal law is the circumstances under which a criminal defendant can waive the right to trial. Under federal law, the defendant can only waive his or her right to trial if it is clear that the defendant understands the \"charges, the consequences of the various pleas, and the availability of counsel\".<ref>{{cite journal |year=1964 |title=Waiver of the Right to Counsel in State Court Cases: The Effect of ''Gideon v.

Wainwright''''', 372 U.S. 335 (1963), is a [[landmark decision|landmark case]] in [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] history. In it, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states are required under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] to provide an attorney to defendants in criminal cases who are unable to afford their own attorneys. The case extended the right to counsel, which had been found under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendments]] to impose requirements on the federal government, by imposing those requirements upon the states as well.\n\n==Background==\nBetween midnight and 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on June 3, 1961, a burglary occurred at the Bay Harbor Pool Room in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], [[Florida]]. An unknown person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole money from a cash register. Later that day, a witness reported that he had seen [[Clarence Earl Gideon]] in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a wine bottle, Coke, and change in his pockets. Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty [[larceny]].\n\nGideon appeared in court alone as he was too poor to afford counsel, whereupon the following conversation took place:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/335|title=Gideon v. Wainwright|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''The COURT:'''  Mr. Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot appoint counsel to represent you in this case.  Under the laws of the State of Florida, the only time the court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is when that person is charged with a capital offense.  I am sorry, but I will have to deny your request to appoint counsel to defend you in this case.\n\n'''GIDEON:'''  The United States Supreme Court says I am entitled to be represented by counsel.\n}}\n\nThe court declined to appoint counsel for Gideon. As a result, he was forced to act as his own counsel and conduct his own defense in court, emphasizing his innocence in the case. At the conclusion of the trial the jury returned a guilty verdict.  The court sentenced Gideon to serve five years in the state prison.\n\nFrom his cell at the [[Florida State Prison]] in [[Raiford, Florida|Raiford]], making use of the prison library and writing in pencil on prison stationery,<ref>{{cite book|title=Petition for a Writ of Certiorari from Clarence Gideon to the Supreme Court of the United States, 01/05/1962|url=https://research.archives.gov/description/597554|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=9 November 2014|year=1962|series=File Unit: Appellate Jurisdiction Case File Gideon v. Wainright, 1/8/1962 - 4/12/1963}}</ref> Gideon appealed to the United States Supreme Court in a suit against the Secretary of the [[Florida Department of Corrections]], H. G. Cochran.  Cochran later retired and was replaced with [[Louie L. Wainwright]] before the case was heard by the Supreme Court. Gideon argued in his appeal that he had been denied counsel and, therefore, his Sixth Amendment rights, as applied to the states by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], had been violated.\n\nThe Supreme Court assigned Gideon a prominent [[Washington, D.C.]], attorney, future Supreme Court justice [[Abe Fortas]] of the law firm [[Arnold & Porter|Arnold, Fortas & Porter]]. [[Bruce Jacob]], who later became Dean of the [[Walter F. George School of Law|Mercer University School of Law]] and Dean of [[Stetson University College of Law]], argued the case for Florida.<ref name=\"WDL\"/> Fortas was assisted by longtime Arnold, Fortas & Porter partner Abe Krash and future famed legal scholar [[John Hart Ely]], then a third-year student at [[Yale Law School]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Krash|first=Abe|title=Architects of Gideon: Remembering Abe Fortas and Hugo Black|url=http://www.nacdl.org/Champion/Articles/98mar02.htm|work=The Champion|publisher=NACDL|accessdate=24 October 2013|date=March 1998}}</ref>\n\nDuring oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Fortas repeatedly referenced that the existing framework for a state trial court to appoint counsel was unworkable.<ref name=\"oyez.org\">\"Gideon v. Wainwright.\" Oyez, 6 Dec. 2018, [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155 www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155].</ref> Under the existing framework, a magistrate in a [[preliminary hearing]] made a determination on whether there were \"special circumstances\" in the case which supported that the defendant should receive counsel. However, as Fortas highlighted, that determination occurred too early in the case to be of any use. For example, whether a witness's statement should be barred because it was [[hearsay]] is an extremely complicated issue that no layman could readily confront, and such a situation only arose in the middle of a trial.\n\nAs a second point, Fortas presented during oral argument that it was widely accepted in the legal community, that the first thing any reputable lawyer does when he is accused of a crime is to hire an attorney. In providing an example, Fortas presented the justices with the fact that when [[Clarence Darrow]], who was widely known as the greatest criminal attorney in the United States, was charged with [[jury tampering]] and suborning perjury, the first thing he did was get an attorney to represent him.<ref name=\"oyez.org\"/> Fortas suggested that if a lawyer as prominent as Darrow needed an attorney to represent him in criminal proceedings, then a man without a legal education or any education for that matter needed a lawyer just the same.<ref name=\"oyez.org\"/>\n\n==Court decision==\n[[File:Gideon petition for certiorari.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of Gideon's handwritten petition for a writ of [[certiorari]] to the US Supreme Court.]]\nThe Supreme Court's decision was announced on March 18, 1963 and delivered by Justice [[Hugo Black]]. The decision was announced as being unanimous in favor of Gideon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155|title=Gideon v. Wainwright|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|publisher=Chicago-Kent College of Law at Illinois Tech|access-date=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Two concurring opinions were written by Justices [[Tom C. Clark|Clark]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II|Harlan]]. Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] wrote a separate opinion. The Supreme Court decision specifically cited its previous ruling in ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (1932). Whether or not the decision in ''Powell v. Alabama'' applied to non-capital cases had sparked heated debate. ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'' (1942) had earlier held that, unless certain circumstances were present, such as illiteracy or low intelligence of the defendant, or an especially complicated case, there was no need for a court-appointed attorney in state court criminal proceedings. ''Betts'' had thus provided selective application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the states, depending on the circumstances, as the Sixth Amendment had only been held binding in federal cases. ''Gideon'' overruled ''Betts'', instead holding that the assistance of counsel, if desired by a defendant who could not afford to hire counsel, was a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, binding on the states, and essential for a fair trial and due process of law regardless of the circumstances of the case.\n\nJustice Clark's concurring opinion stated that the Sixth Amendment does not distinguish between capital and non-capital cases, so legal counsel must be provided for an indigent defendant in all cases.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3935/ |title = Clarence Earl Gideon, Petitioner, vs. Louis L. Wainwright, Director, Department of Corrections, Respondent |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1963 |accessdate = 2013-08-03 }}</ref> Justice Harlan's concurring opinion stated that the mere existence of a serious criminal charge in itself constituted special circumstances requiring the services of counsel at trial.\n\n''Gideon v. Wainwright'' was one of a series of Supreme Court decisions that confirmed the right of defendants in criminal proceedings, upon request, to have counsel appointed both during trial and on appeal. In the subsequent cases of ''[[Massiah v. United States]],'' 377 U.S. 201 (1964) and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Supreme Court further extended the rule to apply even during police interrogation.\n\n==Implications==\n\nApproximately 2,000 individuals were freed in Florida alone as a result of the ''Gideon'' decision. The decision did not directly result in Gideon being freed; instead, he received a new trial with the appointment of defense counsel at the government's expense.\n\nGideon chose [[W. Fred Turner]] to be his lawyer in his second trial. The retrial took place on August 5, 1963, five months after the Supreme Court ruling. During the trial, Turner picked apart the testimony of eyewitness Henry Cook. In his opening and closing statements, Turner suggested that Cook likely had been a lookout for a group of young men who broke into the poolroom to steal beer and then grabbed the coins while they were there. Turner also obtained a statement from a cab driver who had taken Gideon from Bay Harbor to a bar in Panama City, stating that Gideon was carrying neither wine, beer, nor Coke when he picked him up, even though Cook testified that he had watched Gideon walk from the pool hall to a payphone and then wait for a cab. This testimony completely discredited Cook.\n\nThe jury acquitted Gideon after one hour of deliberation. After his acquittal, Gideon resumed his previous life and married some time later. He died of cancer in Fort Lauderdale on January 18, 1972 at age 61. Gideon's family in Missouri accepted his body and laid him to rest in an unmarked grave. A granite headstone was added later.<ref name=\"Beaney1963p1153\">{{cite journal |last=Beaney |first=William M. |authorlink=|year=1963 |title=The Right to Counsel: Past, Present, and Future |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1150\u20131159 [p. 1153] |doi=10.2307/1071050|quote=|jstor=1071050 }}</ref> It was inscribed with a quote from a letter Gideon wrote to Abe Fortas, the attorney appointed to represent him in the Supreme Court: \"Each era finds an improvement in law for the benefit of mankind.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Jack|title=Clarence Earl Gideon: Unlikely World-Shaker|url=http://www.nacdl.org/Champion.aspx?id=25000|publisher=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on courts===\nThe former \"incorrect trial\" rule, where the government was given a fair amount of latitude in criminal proceedings as long as there were no \"shocking departures from fair procedure\", was discarded in favor of a firm set of \"procedural guarantees\" based on the Constitution. The court reversed ''Betts'' and adopted rules that did not require a case-by-case analysis, but instead established the requirement of appointed counsel as a matter of right, without a defendant's having to show \"special circumstances\" that justified the appointment of counsel.<ref name=\"Beaney1963p1153\" /> In this way, the case helped to refine ''[[stare decisis]]'': when a prior appellate court decision should be upheld and what standard should be applied to test a new case against case precedent to achieve acceptable practice and due process of law.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Israel |first=Jerold H. |authorlink= |year=1963 |title=''Gideon v.

The decision created and then expanded the need for public defenders which had previously been rare. For example, immediately following the decision, Florida required [[public defenders]] in all of the state's circuit courts.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Gideon's Promise, Still Unkept |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DA1431F93BA25750C0A965958260 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=1993-03-18 |accessdate=2008-08-08 }}</ref> The need for more public defenders also led to a need to ensure that they were properly trained in criminal defense in order to allow defendants to receive as fair a trial as possible. Several states and counties followed suit. Washington D.C., for instance, has created a training program for their public defenders, who must receive rigorous training before they are allowed to represent defendants, and must continue their training in order to remain current in criminal law, procedure, and practices.<ref name=Abel2006>Abel, Laura. \"2006 ''Edward v. Sparer'' Symposium: Civil ''Gideon'': Creating a Constitutional Right to Counsel in the Civil Context: A Right to Counsel in Civil Cases: Lessons from ''Gideon v. Wainwright''\". ''Temple Political & Civil Rights Law Review'', Volume 15. Summer 2006.</ref> In 2010, a public defender's office in the South Bronx, [[The Bronx Defenders]], created the Center for Holistic Defense, which has helped other public defender offices from Montana to Massachusetts, developed a model of public defense called holistic defense or holistic advocacy. In it, criminal defense attorneys work on interdisciplinary teams, alongside civil attorneys, social workers, and legal advocates to help clients with not only direct but also collateral aspects of their criminal cases. More recently the [[American Bar Association]] and the [[National Legal Aid and Defender Association]] have set minimum training requirements, caseload levels, and experience requirements for defenders.<ref name=Abel2006 /> There is often controversy whether caseloads set upon public defenders give them enough time to sufficiently defend their clients. Some criticize the mindset in which public defense lawyers encourage their clients to simply plead guilty. Some defenders say this is intended to lessen their own workload, while others would say it is intended to obtain a lighter sentence by negotiating a plea bargain as compared with going to trial and perhaps having a harsher sentence imposed. Tanya Greene, an ACLU lawyer, has said that that is why 90 to 95 percent of defendants do plead guilty: \"You've got so many cases, limited resources, and there's no relief. You go to work, you get more cases. You have to triage.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/07/how-well-are-the-poor-publicly-defended/ |author=Daniel June |title=How Well are the Poor Publicly Defended? |date=May 7, 2013 |website=jdjournal.com}}</ref>\n\n===Right to counsel===\nThe ''Doughty v. Maxwell'' decision demonstrates the differences between how states and the federal government address standards for waiver of the right to counsel. In this case the Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the decision of the Ohio court in ''Doughty'', which held that regardless of ''Gideon'', the defendant waived his or her right to appointed counsel by entering a plea of guilty. The underlying alleged crime and trial in ''Doughty'' took place in [[Ohio]], which had its own way of interpreting the right to counsel as do many states.  [[Pennsylvania]] and [[West Virginia]] also deemed that the right to counsel was waived when a plea of guilty was entered. Depending upon one's viewpoint, rules such as these could be seen as an attempt by a state to establish reasonable rules in criminal cases or as an attempt to save money even at the expense of denying a defendant due process. This varies a great deal from federal law, which generally has stricter guidelines for waiving the right to counsel. An analogous area of criminal law is the circumstances under which a criminal defendant can waive the right to trial. Under federal law, the defendant can only waive his or her right to trial if it is clear that the defendant understands the \"charges, the consequences of the various pleas, and the availability of counsel\".<ref>{{cite journal |year=1964 |title=Waiver of the Right to Counsel in State Court Cases: The Effect of ''Gideon v.
