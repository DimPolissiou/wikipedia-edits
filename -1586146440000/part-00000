Produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] ([[John DiMaggio]]){{em dash}}a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), and others. The series is based on a 2007 [[Adventure Time (pilot)|short]] produced for [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and Frederator Studios' animation [[:wikt:incubation|incubator]] series ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''. After the short became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show officially premiered on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for [[List of Adventure Time episodes|episodes]] are decided by [[storyboard]]ing artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016, that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The [[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|series finale]] aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called ''[[Adventure Time: Distant Lands]]'', were announced, which will air exclusively on [[HBO Max]] starting with two in 2020.\n\n''Adventure Time'' has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Annie Award]]s, two [[British Academy Children's Awards]], a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]], and a [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Award]]. The series has also been nominated for three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, two [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy Festival Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|TCA Award]], and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Award]], among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an [[Eisner Award]] and two [[Harvey Awards]]. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{Further|List of Adventure Time characters}}\n\n''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human]]{{efn|name=note13|Also known as Finn Mertens.}} (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog]] ([[John DiMaggio]]), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will. [[Pendleton Ward]], the series' creator, describes Finn as a \"fiery little kid with strong morals\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper Harrison, [[Bill Murray]]'s character in ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''. This means while Jake is somewhat care-free, he will \"sit [Finn] down and give him some decent advice if he really needs it\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a cataclysmic [[nuclear war]] a thousand years before the series' events. Throughout the series, Finn and Jake interact with major characters, including [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom and a sentient piece of [[chewing gum|gum]]; the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), a menacing but largely misunderstood ice wizard; [[Marceline the Vampire Queen]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), a thousand-year-old vampire and [[rock music]] enthusiast; [[Lumpy Space Princess]] (Pendleton Ward), a melodramatic and immature princess made out of \"lumps\"; [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), a sentient video game console-shaped [[robot]] that lives with Finn and Jake; and [[List of Adventure Time characters#Flame Princess|Flame Princess]] ([[Jessica DiCicco]]), a flame [[elemental]] and ruler of the Fire Kingdom.<ref name=voiceactors2/><ref name=candyland/><ref name=characters>{{cite web|title=Adventure Time {{!}} Characters |url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/shows/adventuretime/characters/index.html |publisher=[[Cartoon Network]]  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324215411/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/shows/adventuretime/characters/index.html |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n=== Concept and creation ===\n{{Main|Adventure Time (short film)}}\n\nAccording to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's style was influenced by his time attending the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (CalArts) and his experiences working as a writer and [[storyboard]] artist on ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'', a series which ran on [[Cartoon Network]] from 2008 until 2010.

Inspired by the title sequences of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.<ref name=aotmusicrev/>\n\nThe show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a [[ukulele]]. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele.<ref name=aotmusicrev>{{cite web|last=Ulloa |first=Alexander |title=Adventure Time (2010) |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time/ |website=Art of the Title  |year=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084120/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a [[Temp track|temporary version]]. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it&nbsp;... I only liked the temp one!\"<ref name=aotmusicrev/> Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout.

Produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] ([[John DiMaggio]]){{em dash}}a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), and others. The series is based on a 2007 [[Adventure Time (pilot)|short]] produced for [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and Frederator Studios' animation [[:wikt:incubation|incubator]] series ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''. After the short became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show officially premiered on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for [[List of Adventure Time episodes|episodes]] are decided by [[storyboard]]ing artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016, that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season.{{ref|season10|\u00a7}} The [[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|series finale]] aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called ''[[Adventure Time: Distant Lands]]'', were announced, which will air exclusively on [[HBO Max]] starting with two in 2020.\n\n''Adventure Time'' has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Annie Award]]s, two [[British Academy Children's Awards]], a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]], and a [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Award]]. The series has also been nominated for three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, two [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy Festival Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|TCA Award]], and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Award]], among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an [[Eisner Award]] and two [[Harvey Awards]]. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{Further|List of Adventure Time characters}}\n\n''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human]]{{efn|name=note13|Also known as Finn Mertens.}} (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog]] ([[John DiMaggio]]), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will.

Inspired by the title sequences of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.<ref name=aotmusicrev/>\n\nThe show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a [[ukulele]]. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele.<ref name=aotmusicrev>{{cite web|last=Ulloa |first=Alexander |title=Adventure Time (2010) |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time/ |website=Art of the Title  |year=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084120/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a [[Temp track|temporary version]]. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it&nbsp;...

The idea for the Breeders' Cup was proposed at the 1982 awards luncheon for the [[Kentucky Derby Festival]] by pet food heir [[John R. Gaines]] (1928\u20132005),<ref name=Duckworth/> a leading Thoroughbred owner and breeder who wanted to clean up the sport's image. The Cup was initially faced with much skepticism in the racing community, however with the vocal support of legendary trainer [[John A. Nerud|John Nerud]] and others, the Breeders' Cup was carried out, and subsequently experienced tremendous popularity domestically and abroad.\n\nThe prize money is largely supported by nomination fees paid by breeders for stallions and the resultant foals. In North America, participating stud farms pay an annual nomination fee for a given stallions that is equal to the stallion's advertised stud fee, plus an additional amount if the stallion has more than 50 foals in a given year. The cost to nominate a European stallion is 50% of their stud fee, while the nomination fee for a South American stallion is 25% of their stud fee. In North America, the breeders of the resultant foals must also pay a one-time nomination fee (currently $400) by October 15 of the year of birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeding & Nominations|url=http://www.breederscup.com/history-tradition/breeding-nominations|website=www.breederscup.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe races are operated by Breeders' Cup Limited, a company formed in 1982.

Winners of the  \"Win and You're In\" [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] races automatically qualify. Other pre-entries are ranked by (1) a point system for [[Graded stakes race|graded stakes]] performance during the year, and (2) the judgment of a panel of racing experts. After pre-entries are taken approximately two weeks before the Breeders' Cup, the ranking determines eligibility in oversubscribed races. After pre-entry, any vacancies in the fields are filled by horses in order of panel preference.<ref name=HowItWorks />\n\n==Details==\nThrough 2006, there were eight races on the Breeders' Cup card, all classified as [[graded stakes race|Grade I]] races. In 2007, three races \u2013 the Dirt Mile, Filly and Mare Sprint, and Juvenile Turf \u2013 were added, all of them run the Friday before the remaining eight races.

Since 2013, the gender on both days is mixed between races.]]\nThe order of the races on the card has changed many times throughout the event's history, but the Turf and Classic are traditionally the last two races. The 2008 event was the first in which Day 1 of the event was dedicated to races for fillies and mares, with Day 2 featuring all other races. For 2009, the Marathon, open to runners of both sexes, was moved from Day 2 to be the opening race on Day 1, but all other races stayed on the day they had been run in 2008. In 2011, the Marathon was moved from Day 1 to Day 2, with the Juvenile Sprint becoming the first race overall (and also the only one on Day 1 open to males). The Marathon returned to Day 1 in 2012. Since 2013, the first day was no longer primarily devoted to races for fillies and mares, with the Dirt Mile and Juvenile Turf moving to Day 1 and the Filly & Mare Sprint and Filly & Mare Turf moving to Day 2.\n\nTwo other significant changes were made in 2013. First, the Juvenile Sprint (on dirt) was discontinued after only two runnings. That race had been widely perceived as a consolation prize for horses not good enough to run in the Juvenile.<ref name=Duckworth>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/9902828/oh-breeders-cup-world-championships |title=Oh, Breeders' Cup |first=Amanda |last=Duckworth |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Second, the Ladies' Classic returned to its original name of Distaff. When the latter announcement was made, Breeders' Cup president Craig Fravel said,<blockquote>We restored the Ladies' Classic to its original name due to feedback from our loyal fans who have a strong affinity for the Distaff. In recognition of our 30th year, the Distaff has provided us with some of racing's most remarkable moments, personified by such outstanding thoroughbreds as [[Lady's Secret]], [[Personal Ensign]], [[Azeri (horse)|Azeri]], [[Zenyatta]], and our two-time defending champion, [[Royal Delta]]. It is a fitting tribute to bring back the name Distaff to honor the rich history of the championships.<ref name=Duckworth/></blockquote>\n\nFor 2018, the sprint race for two-year olds was revived, now on turf as the Juvenile Turf Sprint.  According to officials, the turf races for two-year old horses have more entries than can fit within the Breeders' Cup limit of 12 to 14 horses, so they needed to add the third turf race for two-year old horses at 5.5 or six furlongs, depending on the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint added to World Championship Program|url=http://www.breederscup.com/article/breeders-cup-juvenile-turf-sprint-added-world-championships-program|website=Breeders Cup Ltd|publisher=Breeders Cup Ltd|accessdate=6 February 2018|ref=BC2018}}</ref>\n\n==Winners and records==\n\n===Most wins and earnings===\nBreeders' Cup Wins \u2013 Jockey:<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Breeders' Cup jockeys|url=http://stats.breederscup.com/bcosJockeysByMoneyPDF.cfm?jockeyRace=ALL&jockeyYear=ALL&jockeyID=|website=Breeders' Cup|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Mike E.

The idea for the Breeders' Cup was proposed at the 1982 awards luncheon for the [[Kentucky Derby Festival]] by pet food heir [[John R. Gaines]] (1928\u20132005),<ref name=Duckworth/> a leading Thoroughbred owner and breeder who wanted to clean up the sport's image. The Cup was initially faced with much skepticism in the racing community, however with the vocal support of legendary trainer [[John A. Nerud|John Nerud]] and others, the Breeders' Cup was carried out, and subsequently experienced tremendous popularity domestically and abroad.\n\nThe prize money is largely supported by nomination fees paid by breeders for stallions and the resultant foals. In North America, participating stud farms pay an annual nomination fee for a given stallions that is equal to the stallion's advertised stud fee, plus an additional amount if the stallion has more than 50 foals in a given year. The cost to nominate a European stallion is 50% of their stud fee, while the nomination fee for a South American stallion is 25% of their stud fee. In North America, the breeders of the resultant foals must also pay a one-time nomination fee (currently $400) by October 15 of the year of birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeding & Nominations|url=http://www.breederscup.com/history-tradition/breeding-nominations|website=www.breederscup.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe races are operated by Breeders' Cup Limited, a company formed in 1982.

Breeders' Cup Limited has adopted a field selection system to select runners in the event fields are oversubscribed. Winners of the  \"Win and You're In\" [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] races automatically qualify. Other pre-entries are ranked by (1) a point system for [[Graded stakes race|graded stakes]] performance during the year, and (2) the judgment of a panel of racing experts. After pre-entries are taken approximately two weeks before the Breeders' Cup, the ranking determines eligibility in oversubscribed races. After pre-entry, any vacancies in the fields are filled by horses in order of panel preference.<ref name=HowItWorks />\n\n==Details==\nThrough 2006, there were eight races on the Breeders' Cup card, all classified as [[graded stakes race|Grade I]] races. In 2007, three races \u2013 the Dirt Mile, Filly and Mare Sprint, and Juvenile Turf \u2013 were added, all of them run the Friday before the remaining eight races. Three more new races \u2013 a Turf Sprint, Juvenile Filly Turf and Marathon \u2013 were added for 2008.<ref name=\"news.bloodhorse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bloodhorse.com/viewstory.asp?id=42402|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710222148/http://news.bloodhorse.com/viewstory.asp?id=42402|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|title=All Articles - BloodHorse.com|work=bloodhorse.com|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref> A Juvenile Sprint was added for 2011.\n[[File:Breeders Cup 2009 002 (4108584368).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The championship races in 2009 (pictured) were the second year to have a day devoted to female horses. Since 2013, the gender on both days is mixed between races.]]\nThe order of the races on the card has changed many times throughout the event's history, but the Turf and Classic are traditionally the last two races. The 2008 event was the first in which Day 1 of the event was dedicated to races for fillies and mares, with Day 2 featuring all other races. For 2009, the Marathon, open to runners of both sexes, was moved from Day 2 to be the opening race on Day 1, but all other races stayed on the day they had been run in 2008. In 2011, the Marathon was moved from Day 1 to Day 2, with the Juvenile Sprint becoming the first race overall (and also the only one on Day 1 open to males). The Marathon returned to Day 1 in 2012. Since 2013, the first day was no longer primarily devoted to races for fillies and mares, with the Dirt Mile and Juvenile Turf moving to Day 1 and the Filly & Mare Sprint and Filly & Mare Turf moving to Day 2.\n\nTwo other significant changes were made in 2013. First, the Juvenile Sprint (on dirt) was discontinued after only two runnings. That race had been widely perceived as a consolation prize for horses not good enough to run in the Juvenile.<ref name=Duckworth>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/9902828/oh-breeders-cup-world-championships |title=Oh, Breeders' Cup |first=Amanda |last=Duckworth |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Second, the Ladies' Classic returned to its original name of Distaff. When the latter announcement was made, Breeders' Cup president Craig Fravel said,<blockquote>We restored the Ladies' Classic to its original name due to feedback from our loyal fans who have a strong affinity for the Distaff. In recognition of our 30th year, the Distaff has provided us with some of racing's most remarkable moments, personified by such outstanding thoroughbreds as [[Lady's Secret]], [[Personal Ensign]], [[Azeri (horse)|Azeri]], [[Zenyatta]], and our two-time defending champion, [[Royal Delta]]. It is a fitting tribute to bring back the name Distaff to honor the rich history of the championships.<ref name=Duckworth/></blockquote>\n\nFor 2018, the sprint race for two-year olds was revived, now on turf as the Juvenile Turf Sprint.  According to officials, the turf races for two-year old horses have more entries than can fit within the Breeders' Cup limit of 12 to 14 horses, so they needed to add the third turf race for two-year old horses at 5.5 or six furlongs, depending on the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint added to World Championship Program|url=http://www.breederscup.com/article/breeders-cup-juvenile-turf-sprint-added-world-championships-program|website=Breeders Cup Ltd|publisher=Breeders Cup Ltd|accessdate=6 February 2018|ref=BC2018}}</ref>\n\n==Winners and records==\n\n===Most wins and earnings===\nBreeders' Cup Wins \u2013 Jockey:<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Breeders' Cup jockeys|url=http://stats.breederscup.com/bcosJockeysByMoneyPDF.cfm?jockeyRace=ALL&jockeyYear=ALL&jockeyID=|website=Breeders' Cup|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Mike E.

Originally an acronym for \"South-Western Townships\", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883\u20131900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.\n\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated [[Rissik Street Post Office]] is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg|title=Rissik Street Post Office Johannesburg - The Heritage Portal|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111105718/http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Johannesburg City Hall|City Hall]] is also located on Rissik Street.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Johannesburg|Timeline of Johannesburg}}\n[[File:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886]]\nThe region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers who used stone tools.

The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johann and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.

They have guided to the Bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with Bantjes for two nights.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for \u00a33,000. Incidentally, Bantjes had since 1881 been operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in the Cradle of Humankind together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar where they first discovered gold in 1881, and which also offered another kind of discovery - the early ancestors of all mankind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some report Australian George Harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became Johannesburg, as he found gold on a farm in July 1886.

[[Prospecting|Gold prospectors]] soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the [[Witwatersrand]] offered by Bantjes. The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col [[Ignatius Ferreira]], was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because the water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following upon the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of [[Ferreirasdorp]]. The first settlement at Ferreira's Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887.<ref name=\"ReidLane2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andrew M.

In the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902) saw British forces under Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south-west of its then-limits, near present-day Krugersdorp.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nFighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust \u2013 today's Nancefield, [[Eldorado Park, Gauteng|Eldorado Park]] and Naturena \u2013 the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=401&func=select&id=5|title=Battle for Johannesburg|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/ebooks/0%202009may27%20Two%20Battles%20for%20Johannesburg%20_final%20draft_.pdf|title=Hidden in Plain Sight: Johannesburg's Battlefields|author=Engelbrecht, Leon|date=27 May 2009|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417133321/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/ebooks/0%202009may27%20Two%20Battles%20for%20Johannesburg%20_final%20draft_.pdf|archive-date=17 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as \"Asian\", but as \"Coloured\".

Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Hillbrow]] went high-rise.

New freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the [[Carlton Centre]] and the [[Southern Life Centre]]) filled the skyline of the central business district.\n\nUnder the system of ''apartheid'' (Afrikaans for \"apartness\", though the system was founded by the British), a comprehensive system of racial segregation was imposed upon South Africa starting in 1948. The economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of cheap black workers who performed most of the semi-skilled and unskilled work, and which forced the government to make some exceptions to ''apartheid'' in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 86\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 86.</ref> In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for blacks outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 86\"/> [[Soweto]], a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of rural blacks came to Johannesburg.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 92.</ref> It was estimated in 1989 that the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\"/>\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatbeeld in Johannesburg TMnr 10004282.jpg|thumb|Street scene in Johannesburg in 1970]]\nIn March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against ''apartheid'' in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]].<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 80\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 80.</ref> On 11 July 1963, the [[South African Police]] raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Rivonia]] where nine members of the banned [[African National Congress]] (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\"/> The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, two whites and six blacks, one of whom was the future president [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 91.</ref> At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to ''apartheid'' and failed, leaving him with no other choice.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\"/> The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to ''apartheid''.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\"/>\n \t\nOn 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against ''apartheid'' began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 93.</ref> About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the [[Soweto uprising]] of 1976.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 80\"/> Between 1984\u201386, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against  ''apartheid'', and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-''apartheid'' demonstrators.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 100.</ref>\n\nThe central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres.

It was known throughout its redevelopment as the Newtown cultural precinct it was therefore important to stage, old renovated buildings as the setting of the new precinct. Demolishing the old structures and replacing them with new buildings would not have achieved the same effect. Everyone played their part in the marketing, branding and the new identity of the precinct, the City, heritage bodies, heritage practitioners, private companies all played a part. The old warehouse industrial buildings that once lay decaying in Newtown are now synonymous with culture and flair.\n\nLike many cities around the world, there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of Johannesburg.  One of these initiatives is the Maboneng District located on the south-eastern side of the CBD.  Originally a hub for art, it has expanded to include restaurants, entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels.  Maboneng calls itself \"a place of inspiration \u2013 a creative hub, a place to do business, a destination for visitors and a safe, integrated community for residents.  A beacon of strength in Africa's most economically prosperous city\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mabonengprecinct.com|title=Maboneng {{!}} The heart and essence of the city of Joburg|website=Maboneng|language=en-US|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter being destroyed in 2008 to make way for a motor showroom by Imperial Holdings, the iconic Rand Steam Laundries are now being redeveloped as an exact replica, by the order of the Johannesburg Heritage Council.

The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\n\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers \u2013 the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;\u2013 giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>\n\nThe site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa|title=Johannesburg|last=Campbell|first=James T.|date=19 August 2015|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Traffic in the midst of the rain and fog.jpg|thumb|Rain and fog in July 2016]]\n[[File:A Johannesburg Summers Day.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph of summer rain clouds over Johannesburg.

The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].\n\nGreater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\":0\"/> Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria.\n\nTraditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as [[Hyde Park, South Africa|Hyde Park]], [[Sandhurst, South Africa|Sandhurst]], [[Northcliff]], [[Hurlingham, Gauteng|Hurlingham]], [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] made his home. The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].\n\nTo the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians. Closer to Alexandria communities like Glenazel and Norwood have been integral in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist Union of Southern Africa]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa]] ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Africa]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg]] ([[Catholic Church]]) and the [[Johannesburg South Africa Temple]] ([[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]).<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa SouthAfrica], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques, [[Hindu]] temples, A Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.\n\n== Cityscape ==\nThe city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013}}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD.  Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.\n\nDue to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of {{convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out}}.

Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name=\"cityparks-whoweare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world.

The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJohannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747SP]] now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\n\nJohannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]].\n\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe minibus \"taxis\" are the ''de facto'' standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population.

The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].\n\n[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport]]\nA part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\n\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north\u2013the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\n\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs.

It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\n\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|last=|first=|date=|work=Fin24|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}\nThe fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic.

Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nVisitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.\n\nOn the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Joburg Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|\"receiving house\"]] of live entertainment\u2014presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.\n\nShopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as [[Sandton City]], [[Mall of Africa]], and [[Nelson Mandela Square]], to various markets and [[flea market]]s, such as the [[Oriental Plaza]] and the [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank Flea Market]]; the latter are popular for souvenirs and [[African art]]. See [[Johannesburg#Retail|above]]. (Cultural) tourists also visit the \"Mai Mai Market\"<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=308&Itemid=52 Mai Mai Market] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114145111/https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=308&Itemid=52 |date=14 November 2017 }}, joburg.org.za</ref> (\"Ezinyangeni\"&nbsp;\u2013 the place of healers; located on the eastern wing of the city centre) dedicated to traditional herbs and [[sangoma|traditional healers]].\n\nThe [[Cradle of Humankind]] a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is {{convert|25|km}} to the northwest of the city. The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''. Other attractions in this area include the [[Lesedi Cultural Village]], while [[Magaliesburg, Gauteng|Magaliesburg]] and the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the [[Human evolution#Out of Africa|origins of humankind in Africa]], and houses an extensive collection of [[rock art]].\n\nJohannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view [[wildlife]], in addition to the [[Johannesburg Zoo]], one of the largest in South Africa. The [[Lion Park]] nature reserve, next to Lesedi Cultural Village, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the [[Krugersdorp Nature Reserve]], a 1500 [[Hectare|ha]] [[game reserve]], is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewildt.co.za/|title=The Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre - De Wildt|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> in the [[Magaliesberg]] runs a successful breeding program for [[cheetah]], [[African wild dog|wild dog]] and other [[endangered species]].

Originally an acronym for \"South-Western Townships\", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883\u20131900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.\n\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area.

The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\n\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers \u2013 the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;\u2013 giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>\n\nThe site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold.

The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].\n\nGreater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\":0\"/> Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria.\n\nTraditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as [[Hyde Park, South Africa|Hyde Park]], [[Sandhurst, South Africa|Sandhurst]], [[Northcliff]], [[Hurlingham, Gauteng|Hurlingham]], [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] made his home. The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].\n\nTo the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians. Closer to Alexandria communities like Glenazel and Norwood have been integral in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist Union of Southern Africa]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa]] ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Africa]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg]] ([[Catholic Church]]) and the [[Johannesburg South Africa Temple]] ([[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]).<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa SouthAfrica], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques, [[Hindu]] temples, A Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.\n\n== Cityscape ==\nThe city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013}}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD.

It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg.

Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name=\"cityparks-whoweare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world.

The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJohannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747SP]] now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\n\nJohannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]].\n\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination.

The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].\n\n[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport]]\nA part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\n\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north\u2013the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\n\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Railway country. 150 Years of Rail in South Africa|url=http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Heritage/150years/150YearsRail.pdf|publisher=Transnet}}</ref>\n\n[[File:N1 road South Africa.jpg|thumb|The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] is a major freeway in Johannesburg]]\nIn 2010, a [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] was proposed between Johannesburg and [[Durban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html|accessdate=19 September 2010|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding}}</ref>\n\nJohannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by [http://www.mbus.co.za/ Metrobus], a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\n\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|last=|first=|date=|work=Fin24|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}\nThe fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26|publisher=SA National Roads Agency|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=18 perish in road accidents|url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=NewsDay|date=10 May 2013}}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.\n\nJohannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg. The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] and [[M2 road (Johannesburg)|M2]] freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre.

Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the [[Lesotho Highlands Water Project]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.\n\nThe container terminal at [[City Deep, Gauteng|City Deep]] is known to be the largest \"[[dry port]]\" in the world,{{Citation needed|reason=Johannesburg not mentioned in dry port article, largest dry port in world is significant claim|date=March 2015}} with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg.

The two main print media groups are Independent Newspapers and Naspers (Media24). The country's electronic media is also headquartered in the greater metropolitan region.

The ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' is an investigative liberal newspaper while ''[[The Citizen (newspaper, South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' is a tabloid-style paper, and ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' is a local newspaper that mostly covers [[Gauteng]]-related issues. The ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' is the most widely read national Sunday newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} ''True Love'' is the most widely read women's magazine,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} catering primarily to the up-and-coming middle class black female market, and published by Media 24. ''[[The Times (South Africa)|The Times]]'' is a national newspaper that covers current issues.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMedia ownership is relatively complicated, with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years, resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders. This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as [[YFM]], Metro FM, [[Phalaphala FM]], Talk Radio 702, [[94.7 Highveld Stereo|Highveld Stereo]] now known as 947, [[5FM]], UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM. The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government has sold off frequencies to private companies.

Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nVisitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.\n\nOn the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Joburg Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|\"receiving house\"]] of live entertainment\u2014presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.\n\nShopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as [[Sandton City]], [[Mall of Africa]], and [[Nelson Mandela Square]], to various markets and [[flea market]]s, such as the [[Oriental Plaza]] and the [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank Flea Market]]; the latter are popular for souvenirs and [[African art]].

The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''. Other attractions in this area include the [[Lesedi Cultural Village]], while [[Magaliesburg, Gauteng|Magaliesburg]] and the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the [[Human evolution#Out of Africa|origins of humankind in Africa]], and houses an extensive collection of [[rock art]].\n\nJohannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view [[wildlife]], in addition to the [[Johannesburg Zoo]], one of the largest in South Africa.
