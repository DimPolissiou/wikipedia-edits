He first settled in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] in October 1854. On December 10, 1854, after helping to find a location for the new townsite of Topeka, he wrote a letter to his wife saying:\n\n<blockquote>I am now thirty miles above Lawrence on the Kansas River assisting in starting a new town.

In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral deposits of [[tin]], [[zinc]], and [[gold]]. In 1899 his son [[Charles K.

Holliday's legal skills were called on again to create the paperwork for a new railroad.

The first known system, a tropical depression, formed on June&nbsp;19, while the last known system, a tropical storm, transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26. A total of 11&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone]]s developed, 9&nbsp;of which intensified into tropical storms, the most since 1916. Additionally, the October tropical depression was previously recognized as a tropical storm until reanalysis in 2009, while two other tropical storms were added to the [[HURDAT|Atlantic hurricane database]] that year. Four of the tropical storms intensified into hurricanes, one of which reached major hurricane intensity\u2014Category 3 or higher on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]].<ref name=\"ACE\"/> The sixth, seven, and eight storms as well as the October tropical depression existed simultaneously on October&nbsp;16. \n\nFour tropical cyclones made [[landfall]] in the United States during 1923, with three striking the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] and the other hitting [[Massachusetts]]. The first of the four, which struck [[Louisiana]] in June, mostly produced excessive rainfall along the Gulf Coast and parts of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. A storm which formed in the [[Pacific hurricane|eastern Pacific basin]] around October&nbsp;12 struck Louisiana as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on October&nbsp;16. The system caused some damage to coastal areas, especially between [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Just two days another, a tropical storm also struck Louisiana but caused less damage, though four people died after a ship capsized in [[Perdido Bay]]. On October&nbsp;19, a cyclone struck Massachusetts, but produced mostly beneficial rainfall in [[New England]]. The fifth system and the October tropical depression caused significant impact as extratropical cyclones. The former left at least 9&nbsp;deaths and about $300,000 (1923&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage in Atlantic Canada, while the latter was attributed to 2&nbsp;fatalities and more than $1&nbsp;million in damage along the East Coast of the United States. \n\nThe season's activity was reflected with an [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating of 49&nbsp;units,<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite web|work=Hurricane Research Division |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |date=June 2019|title=Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|url=https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/comparison_table.html|accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref> ranking it as below average.<ref>{{cite report|work=Climate Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=November 29, 2015|title=Background Information: The North Atlantic Hurricane Season|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/background_information.shtml|location=College Park, Maryland}}</ref> ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACE.
