This was their only punt of the game, as the Gators scored on all but one of their succeeding drives\u2014[[Will Grier]] lost a fumble behind the [[line of scrimmage|line]] in the second quarter.  Quarterbacks [[Treon Harris]] and Will Grier combined for 379 passing yards and five passing touchdowns in a promising display of offense, producing a total of 606 yards.  Harris had more passing yards than Grier, although Grier did run for a touchdown in the second quarter.  On the defensive side of the ball, the Gators defense held the Aggies to a mere 200 yards, allowing only a few big plays.

In the first half, [[placekicker]] Austin Hardin missed 2 field goals.  After falling behind 10\u201314 early in the third quarter, Florida seemed to be pulling away as they led 31\u201317, however East Carolina would score a touchdown with 3:04 remaining in the game.  On the ensuing possession, the Gators went [[three-and-out]], and [[Punt (gridiron football)|punted]] the ball back to East Carolina, who would get well into Florida territory before quarterback Blake Kemp fumbled a pass attempt, which was recovered by [[defensive end]] Alex McAlister, who would have scored had his teammate, Jarrad Davis, not tackled him.  Florida was able to kneel to run off the final 12 seconds.  Head coach Jim McElwain called the Gators' performance \"embarrassing,\" not only speaking of the several missed opportunities to put points on the board, but also of the 12 penalties totaling 105 yards, including two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls following scores.  McElwain added that his team \"didn't deserve to win the game,\" and addressed the issue of being penalized 12 times, saying \"this is not how it's going to be around here anymore.\"  The 12 Florida penalties sharply contrast last week's season opener, where the Gators showed above average discipline, as they were penalized only once.<ref name=\"ECU recap\" />\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{see also|2015 Kentucky Wildcats football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Florida Gators|color=white}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Florida Gators at Kentucky Wildcats \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 19, 2015\n|time=7:39 p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time (North America)|EDT]]\n|road='''Florida'''\n|R1=7|R2=7|R3=0|R4=0\n|home=Kentucky\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=0|H4=6\n|stadium= [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] \u2022 [[Lexington, Kentucky]]\n|attendance=63,040\n|weather=Temperature: {{convert|67|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} \u2022 Wind: NNW at {{convert|8|mph|km/h}} \u2022 Weather: Mostly cloudy\n|referee=John McDaid\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Brent Musburger]] and [[Jesse Palmer]]<ref name=\"UK Pregame\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/notes/pre/20150919193000.pdf |title=UK Pregame |access-date=September 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927005520/http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/notes/pre/20150919193000.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|TV=[[SEC Network Football|SEC Network]]\n|reference=[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/boxscore.php?gameid=12753 Boxscore]\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 [[Will Grier]] 1-yard run (Austin Hardin kick), 8:48\n*Kentucky \u2013 Austin MacGinnis 29-yard field goal, 2:04\n;Second Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 Kelvin Taylor 3-yard run (Austin Hardin kick), 0:14\n;Fourth Quarter\n*Kentucky \u2013 Austin MacGinnis 22-yard field goal, 14:50\n*Kentucky \u2013 Austin MacGinnis 45-yard field goal, 10:57\n|stats=\n;Passing\n*FLA \u2013 [[Will Grier]] \u2013 13/22, 125 yards, 1 interception\n*KEN \u2013 Patrick Towles \u2013 8/24, 126 yards, 2 interceptions\n;Rushing\n*FLA \u2013 Will Grier \u2013 12 carries, 61 yards, 1 touchdown\n*KEN \u2013 Stanley Williams \u2013 16 carries, 80 yards\n;Receiving\n*FLA \u2013 Jake Mcgee \u2013 3 receptions, 30 yards\n*KEN \u2013 Dorian Baker \u2013 4 receptions, 38 yards\n;Tackling\n*FLA \u2013 Jarrad Davis \u2013 10 tackles\n*KEN \u2013 Khalid Henderson \u2013 9 tackles\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Both teams' offenses would put on a rather stale performance for the rest of the first quarter\u2014four of the following six possessions ended in three-and-outs; five ended in punts.  Georgia committed the first turnover of the game from a Faton Bauta pass intercepted by Marcus Maye.  Florida could not capitalize on the turnover, and was forced to punt.  Georgia's Reggie Davis, however, who was deep to receive, muffed the punt at the 5-yard line, and the ball rolled into the end zone where it was fallen upon by Nick Washington for a touchdown.  The extra point try was blocked, and Florida was forced to kickoff from their own 20-yard line to begin the second quarter due to a personal foul that occurred on the Georgia return.  Georgia's ensuing drive ended in a turnover on downs, and Florida gained possession at their own 39-yard line.  Florida would punt after four plays, forcing Georgia to start at their own 3-yard line.  Georgia managed to drive to their own 35-yard line, before punting back to Florida.  The Gators then went 79 yards in five plays to score a touchdown following a 66-yard pass from [[Treon Harris]] to Antonio Callaway.  Austin Hardin would make the extra point on this try, and Florida took a 13\u20130 lead just over halfway through the second quarter.  Faton Bauta threw his second interception on the third play of the ensuing possessions, which was returned to the 5-yard line.  Florida would score a touchdown two plays later.

Florida, however, would give the ball back to Georgia following a turnover of their own when Davin Bellamy forced Treon Harris to fumble, and recovered.  Georgia capitalized on the turnover when Marshall Morgan kicked a 26-yard field goal, cutting Florida's advantage to 17.  Florida punted after six plays, and Georgia drove to their own 48-yard line before turning over on downs.  Florida would then go on a six-minute drive, but turned over on downs at the Georgia 11-yard line.

Jordan Scarlett picked up 20 more yards on the first scrimmage play, setting up 1st-and-goal at the 3-yard line in only 28 seconds.  Florida's opening possession, however, would stall when the Gators failed to score after playing from scrimmage on fourth down instead of attempting a field goal.  Vanderbilt was only able to reach their own 17-yard line before punting.  The Gators put on another good kick return with Antonio Callaway returning the punt for 27 yards to Vanderbilt's 41-yard line.  Six plays later, the Gators found the end zone following a 3-yard run by Kelvin Taylor.  However, for the second consecutive game, Florida would fail to convert the extra point try, when walk-on Neil MacInnes missed the uprights.  Vanderbilt's possession began at their own 25-yard line following a [[touchback]] by Austin Hardin.  Following a six-play drive that consisted of five running plays, the Commodores punted from Florida's 37-yard line.  Florida continued their possession into the second quarter, and drove to the Vanderbilt 26-yard line before facing fourth down.  The Gators lined up to attempt a field goal, however holder Johnny Townsend passed the ball up the middle of the field where Cece Jefferson completed it past the line to gain, but Vanderbilt's Caleb Azubike would force a fumble which Vanderbilt would recover at their own 19-yard line.  Vanderbilt failed to capitalize on the turnover, as they punted after going three-and-out.  Antonio Callaway returned the punt once again into Commodore territory at the 45-yard line.  Facing 3rd-and-13, [[Treon Harris]] would rush over the left end past the line to gain to the 18-yard line, but Vanderbilt was able to force another fumble, which was recovered by Zach Cunningham, resulting in Florida's second consecutive drive ending in a turnover.  Vanderbilt, however, once again would fail to capitalize on the turnover, and punted back to Florida after gaining five yards in 6 plays.  The next two possessions resulted in punts following three-and-outs.  Florida gained possession after Vanderbilt's three-and-out at their own 36-yard line with 3:26 remaining in the second quarter.  They would drive into Vanderbilt territory before they committed their third turnover of the second quarter when Treon Harris threw a pass which was intercepted Ryan White at the 26-yard line.  With 59 seconds remaining, Vanderbilt had Ralph Webb run a draw play, which went 74 yards for a touchdown.  Hayden Lekacz converted the extra point try to take a one-point lead over the no. 11 Gators.  Florida took over possession at their own 25-yard line with 48 seconds remaining, but failed to reach midfield and punted to Ryan White at the 6-yard line, and the Commodores kneeled to run off the final seconds of the first half to go into the locker room leading 7\u20136.<br>Vanderbilt received the second half kickoff, but went three-and-out and punted.  Every possession of the third quarter ended with a punt.  Vanderbilt punted to Florida with 14:39 in the fourth quarter, and the Gators began their drive from their own 31-yard line.  Florida would go 57 yards in seven plays, but committed their fourth turnover at the Vanderbilt 12-yard line when Jay Woods forced Demarcus Robinson to fumble.  Vanderbilt's drive would take 5:29 off the clock before they punted from their own 33-yard line.  Johnny Openshaw's punt would only go 12 yards before going out of bounds, and Florida took over from the Vanderbilt 45-yard line with 5:37 remaining.  Florida drove to the 25-yard line in 3:10 before facing 4th-and-1.  Austin Hardin would attempt 43-yard field goal, which went through the uprights to give the Gators their first lead since late in the first half.  Vanderbilt returned the ensuing kickoff to their own 13-yard line, and soon faced 4th-and-10.

After the punt, the Gators took over at their own 33-yard line.  South Carolina would get the ball back three plays later following Treon Harris's second interception of the game, this time caught by Gerald Dixon.  However, South Carolina could not capitalize, and went three-and-out again.  Florida would go on its third double-digit play drive of the game, with Austin Hardin kicking a 39-yard field goal to cap off a 12-play, 70-yard drive.  Florida would again gain possession following a South Carolina three-and-out, and would go on their fourth double-digit play drive of the game, but turned the ball over on downs at the Gamecocks' 36-yard line.  The Gamecocks would finally be able to capitalize on a stalled Gator drive by 64 yards in 8 plays to score a touchdown with 8:59 remaining in the game.  Florida's ensuing possession ended in a three-and-out, and South Carolina was able to continue their momentum, scoring their second straight touchdown with 4:49 remaining.  Now holding a slim three-point lead, Florida took over at their own 25-yard line following a touchback.  The Gators would need only six plays this time to score their third touchdown of the game from a 1-yard run by Kelvin Taylor, following up his 53-yard run on the previous play, and the Gators took a 10-point lead with 2:01 remaining.  On the Gamecocks' ensuing drive, they would get to the Florida 48-yard line, but [[defensive back]] Quincy Wilson would intercept a Perry Orth pass, and the Gators were able run out almost all of the remaining time, but punted back to South Carolina, who took over with three seconds remaining, and ran one play before time expired.<ref name=\"South Carolina boxscore\">[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/boxscore.php?gameid=12760 South Carolina boxscore]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=31716 |title=The Quick Slant: Gators 24, South Carolina 14 (Instant Analysis) |last1=Carter |first1=Scott |date=November 14, 2015 |website=gatorzone.com |publisher=[[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Assoc., Inc.]], [[Fox Sports Sun]] & [[IMG College]] |access-date=November 15, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWith the win, the Gators snapped a two-year losing streak to the Gamecocks, and finished with a perfect record against SEC Eastern Division opponents.

Florida would leave the end zone empty handed, however, as Austin Hardin hit the left upright on a 33-yard field goal attempt.  On the ensuing Florida Atlantic possession, the Owls drove 51 yards in ten plays to reach the Gators' 29-yard line before junior kicker Greg Joseph went wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt.  The two teams would punt to end their remaining drives and the first half concluded as a scoreless tie.  The first half saw both teams miss a field goal, exchange nine punts, and go a combined 1-for-13 on third down conversions, the Owls with the lone third down conversion through the first half.  Additionally, Florida Atlantic's offense outperformed the Gators in total yardage by more than twice, garnering 150 yards of offense to Florida's 69.\nOffensive struggles persisted for both teams during the first portion of the second half as the teams' initial second half drives ended in punts.  The second Florida Atlantic possession was halted by a forced fumble by [[Antonio Morrison (American football)|Antonio Morrison]] which was recovered by defensive lineman Tavin Bryan at midfield and returned to Florida's 2-yard line.  [[Kelvin Taylor]] punched in the ball in two plays to break the tie with a 7\u20130 lead.  After a Florida Atlantic punt, the Gators scored again with a 53-yard [[Treon Harris]]\u2013Antonio Callaway connection with 5:34 to go in the third quarter.  Florida Atlantic responded on the ensuing drive by scoring on 9 plays to relegate the Florida lead back to 7 points.  Florida's next possession ended with a deep pass from Treon Harris being intercepted in the end zone by Florida Atlantic's Sharrod Neasman for a touchback, and the Owls took over on their own 20-yard line.  The Gators would reclaim possession three plays later when [[Jalen Tabor]] intercepted FAU quarterback Jaquez Johnson at the Owls' 21-yard line.  The Gators would not score however, as Hardin again missed a field goal, this time from 34 yards out.  With new life and still down by 7, the Owls picked up a first down but had to punt after 5 plays.  The Gators picked up at their own 10-yard line.  Jordan Scarlett was able to pick up 6 yards before Harris fumbled after being hit by Trey Hendrickson.  Ocie Rose jumped onto the ball in the end zone and after the successful FAU try, the Owls had managed to tie the game at 14.  With 8:03 remaining in the game, Florida took over, only to go [[three-and-out]].  Three plays into the ensuing Owls drive, however, Nick Washington forced a fumble that was recovered by [[Marcus Maye]] giving the Gators their third takeaway of the game.  Florida's offense once again stalled, however, and all of the drives that followed in the fourth quarter ended in punts before the Owls ran out the clock deep in their own territory to send the game into overtime.  Florida had the first possession of the overtime period and scored in three plays on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Treon Harris to [[Jake McGee]], but led only by 6 after Austin Hardin's extra point attempt was blocked.  Florida Atlantic would reach the 9-yard line before the Gators defense stuffed a quarterback run for a loss of three yards followed by forcing three consecutive incompletions to preserve a final 20\u201314 overtime lead.<ref name=\"FAU recap\">{{cite web |url=http://floridagators.com/news/2015/11/22/31770.aspx?path=football |title=Gators GameDay: No. 8 Florida 20, Florida Atlantic 14 (Final/Overtime) |date=November 22, 2015 |website=floridagators.com |publisher=[[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Assoc., Inc.]], [[Fox Sports Sun]] & [[IMG College]] |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe win gave [[Jim McElwain]] his tenth win with the Florida Gators, the most wins of any first year Florida coach.\n\n===Florida State===\n{{see also|2015 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Florida Gators|color=white}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Florida State Seminoles at Florida Gators \u2013 Game summary\n|date=November 28, 2015\n|time=7:37 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]]\n|road='''No. 14 Florida State'''\n|R1=0|R2=10|R3=3|R4=14\n|home=No. 10 Florida\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=2\n|stadium= [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] \u2022 [[Gainesville, Florida]]\n|attendance=90,916\n|weather=Temperature: {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} \u2022 Wind: ENE at {{convert|5|mph|km/h}} \u2022 Weather: 85% humidity\n|referee=Hubert Owens\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Mike Patrick]] and [[Ed Cunningham]]<ref name=\"FSU Pregame\">[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/notes/pre/20151128193000.pdf FSU Pregame]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|TV=[[ESPN College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN]]\n|reference=[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/boxscore.php?gameid=12762 Boxscore]\n|scoring=\n;Second Quarter\n*Florida State \u2013 [[Roberto Aguayo]] 45-yard field goal, 12:11\n*Florida State \u2013 Jeremy Kerr 1-yard pass from Sean Maguire (Roberto Aguayo kick), 7:47\n;Third Quarter\n*Florida State \u2013 Roberto Aguayo 51-yard field goal, 5:21\n;Fourth Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 Team safety, 8:58\n*Florida State \u2013 [[Dalvin Cook]] 15-yard run (Roberto Aguayo kick), 6:17\n*Florida State \u2013 Dalvin Cook 29-yard run (Roberto Aguayo kick), 0:20\n|stats=\n;Passing\n*FSU \u2013 Sean Maguire \u2013 14/28, 160 yards, 1 touchdown\n*FLA \u2013 [[Treon Harris]] \u2013 19/38, 134 yards\n;Rushing\n*FSU \u2013 [[Dalvin Cook]] \u2013 26 carries, 183 yards, 2 touchdowns\n*FLA \u2013 Kelvin Taylor \u2013 24 carries, 136 yards\n;Receiving\n*FSU \u2013 Kermit Whitfield \u2013 2 receptions, 52 yards\n*FLA \u2013 Jake McGee \u2013 4 receptions, 34 yards\n;Tackling\n*FSU \u2013 Derwin James, Reggie Northrup, Terrance Smith \u2013 9 tackles\n*FLA \u2013 Jarrad Davis and Keanu Neal \u2013 9 tackles\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the first half, [[placekicker]] Austin Hardin missed 2 field goals.  After falling behind 10\u201314 early in the third quarter, Florida seemed to be pulling away as they led 31\u201317, however East Carolina would score a touchdown with 3:04 remaining in the game.  On the ensuing possession, the Gators went [[three-and-out]], and [[Punt (gridiron football)|punted]] the ball back to East Carolina, who would get well into Florida territory before quarterback Blake Kemp fumbled a pass attempt, which was recovered by [[defensive end]] Alex McAlister, who would have scored had his teammate, Jarrad Davis, not tackled him.  Florida was able to kneel to run off the final 12 seconds.  Head coach Jim McElwain called the Gators' performance \"embarrassing,\" not only speaking of the several missed opportunities to put points on the board, but also of the 12 penalties totaling 105 yards, including two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls following scores.  McElwain added that his team \"didn't deserve to win the game,\" and addressed the issue of being penalized 12 times, saying \"this is not how it's going to be around here anymore.\"  The 12 Florida penalties sharply contrast last week's season opener, where the Gators showed above average discipline, as they were penalized only once.<ref name=\"ECU recap\" />\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{see also|2015 Kentucky Wildcats football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Florida Gators|color=white}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Florida Gators at Kentucky Wildcats \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 19, 2015\n|time=7:39 p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time (North America)|EDT]]\n|road='''Florida'''\n|R1=7|R2=7|R3=0|R4=0\n|home=Kentucky\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=0|H4=6\n|stadium= [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] \u2022 [[Lexington, Kentucky]]\n|attendance=63,040\n|weather=Temperature: {{convert|67|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} \u2022 Wind: NNW at {{convert|8|mph|km/h}} \u2022 Weather: Mostly cloudy\n|referee=John McDaid\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Brent Musburger]] and [[Jesse Palmer]]<ref name=\"UK Pregame\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/notes/pre/20150919193000.pdf |title=UK Pregame |access-date=September 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927005520/http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/notes/pre/20150919193000.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|TV=[[SEC Network Football|SEC Network]]\n|reference=[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/boxscore.php?gameid=12753 Boxscore]\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 [[Will Grier]] 1-yard run (Austin Hardin kick), 8:48\n*Kentucky \u2013 Austin MacGinnis 29-yard field goal, 2:04\n;Second Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 Kelvin Taylor 3-yard run (Austin Hardin kick), 0:14\n;Fourth Quarter\n*Kentucky \u2013 Austin MacGinnis 22-yard field goal, 14:50\n*Kentucky \u2013 Austin MacGinnis 45-yard field goal, 10:57\n|stats=\n;Passing\n*FLA \u2013 [[Will Grier]] \u2013 13/22, 125 yards, 1 interception\n*KEN \u2013 Patrick Towles \u2013 8/24, 126 yards, 2 interceptions\n;Rushing\n*FLA \u2013 Will Grier \u2013 12 carries, 61 yards, 1 touchdown\n*KEN \u2013 Stanley Williams \u2013 16 carries, 80 yards\n;Receiving\n*FLA \u2013 Jake Mcgee \u2013 3 receptions, 30 yards\n*KEN \u2013 Dorian Baker \u2013 4 receptions, 38 yards\n;Tackling\n*FLA \u2013 Jarrad Davis \u2013 10 tackles\n*KEN \u2013 Khalid Henderson \u2013 9 tackles\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Kentucky scored a game-tying 51-yard field goal with 3:52 left in the fourth quarter.  Florida later missed a game-winning field goal, and sent the game to overtime.

The Gators scored another touchdown in the second quarter to extend their lead to a comfortable 14\u20133.  Florida could not score for the remainder of the game, however their defense was able to hold Kentucky's potent offense led by Patrick Towles, one of the SEC's top returning quarterbacks, to only two additional field goals, and intercepted a desperation pass on 4th & 27 to secure the result and kneel off the remaining time.  Starting quarterback Will Grier played for the entire game, and was the team's top rusher with 61 yards.  Treon Harris did warm up on the sideline when Grier's offense seemed to dwindle, but Jim McElwain asked if Grier could continue, which he affirmed.

However, the punt was muffed by LSU's [[Tre'Davious White]], and Florida's Nick Washington recovered at the 13-yard line.  Facing 4th-and-1 at the LSU 4-yard line, Florida elected to go for the first down from scrimmage, doing that and more as [[Treon Harris]] completed a pass to Jake McGee for a touchdown.  On LSU's ensuing drive, [[Leonard Fournette]] earned his team a first down on their first play from scrimmage, but was forced to punt three plays later just as the Gators did.

In last year's matchup, the Gators and Commodores played a tight first quarter as they split two touchdowns, however Florida managed 10 points in the second quarter to take a 17\u20137 halftime lead.  The Gators resumed their scoring routine after a scoreless third quarter, scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter, holding Vanderbilt to a mere field goal.<ref name=\"Vanderbilt\u2013Florida sports-reference\">[https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/play-index/rivals.cgi?request=1&school_id=florida&opp_id=vanderbilt Florida all-time record vs. Vanderbilt]</ref><br>[[Running back]] Jordan Cronkrite would be ineligible for the first half of the game by virtue of his ejection due to targeting in the previous game against [[2015 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]].<ref name=\"UGA Postgame\" /><br>\nFlorida entered the game with one win away from winning the SEC Eastern Division championship outright and securing a berth in the [[2015 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]].\n\nFlorida's Brandon Powell returned the opening kickoff for 71 yards to the Vanderbilt 23-yard line.  Jordan Scarlett picked up 20 more yards on the first scrimmage play, setting up 1st-and-goal at the 3-yard line in only 28 seconds.  Florida's opening possession, however, would stall when the Gators failed to score after playing from scrimmage on fourth down instead of attempting a field goal.  Vanderbilt was only able to reach their own 17-yard line before punting.  The Gators put on another good kick return with Antonio Callaway returning the punt for 27 yards to Vanderbilt's 41-yard line.  Six plays later, the Gators found the end zone following a 3-yard run by Kelvin Taylor.  However, for the second consecutive game, Florida would fail to convert the extra point try, when walk-on Neil MacInnes missed the uprights.  Vanderbilt's possession began at their own 25-yard line following a [[touchback]] by Austin Hardin.  Following a six-play drive that consisted of five running plays, the Commodores punted from Florida's 37-yard line.  Florida continued their possession into the second quarter, and drove to the Vanderbilt 26-yard line before facing fourth down.  The Gators lined up to attempt a field goal, however holder Johnny Townsend passed the ball up the middle of the field where Cece Jefferson completed it past the line to gain, but Vanderbilt's Caleb Azubike would force a fumble which Vanderbilt would recover at their own 19-yard line.  Vanderbilt failed to capitalize on the turnover, as they punted after going three-and-out.  Antonio Callaway returned the punt once again into Commodore territory at the 45-yard line.  Facing 3rd-and-13, [[Treon Harris]] would rush over the left end past the line to gain to the 18-yard line, but Vanderbilt was able to force another fumble, which was recovered by Zach Cunningham, resulting in Florida's second consecutive drive ending in a turnover.  Vanderbilt, however, once again would fail to capitalize on the turnover, and punted back to Florida after gaining five yards in 6 plays.  The next two possessions resulted in punts following three-and-outs.  Florida gained possession after Vanderbilt's three-and-out at their own 36-yard line with 3:26 remaining in the second quarter.  They would drive into Vanderbilt territory before they committed their third turnover of the second quarter when Treon Harris threw a pass which was intercepted Ryan White at the 26-yard line.  With 59 seconds remaining, Vanderbilt had Ralph Webb run a draw play, which went 74 yards for a touchdown.  Hayden Lekacz converted the extra point try to take a one-point lead over the no. 11 Gators.  Florida took over possession at their own 25-yard line with 48 seconds remaining, but failed to reach midfield and punted to Ryan White at the 6-yard line, and the Commodores kneeled to run off the final seconds of the first half to go into the locker room leading 7\u20136.<br>Vanderbilt received the second half kickoff, but went three-and-out and punted.  Every possession of the third quarter ended with a punt.  Vanderbilt punted to Florida with 14:39 in the fourth quarter, and the Gators began their drive from their own 31-yard line.  Florida would go 57 yards in seven plays, but committed their fourth turnover at the Vanderbilt 12-yard line when Jay Woods forced Demarcus Robinson to fumble.  Vanderbilt's drive would take 5:29 off the clock before they punted from their own 33-yard line.  Johnny Openshaw's punt would only go 12 yards before going out of bounds, and Florida took over from the Vanderbilt 45-yard line with 5:37 remaining.  Florida drove to the 25-yard line in 3:10 before facing 4th-and-1.  Austin Hardin would attempt 43-yard field goal, which went through the uprights to give the Gators their first lead since late in the first half.  Vanderbilt returned the ensuing kickoff to their own 13-yard line, and soon faced 4th-and-10.  Johnny McCrary's pass was incomplete, but Florida committed a [[Holding (American football)|holding]] foul, which gave Vanderbilt an automatic first down.

The Gators would reclaim possession three plays later when [[Jalen Tabor]] intercepted FAU quarterback Jaquez Johnson at the Owls' 21-yard line.  The Gators would not score however, as Hardin again missed a field goal, this time from 34 yards out.  With new life and still down by 7, the Owls picked up a first down but had to punt after 5 plays.  The Gators picked up at their own 10-yard line.  Jordan Scarlett was able to pick up 6 yards before Harris fumbled after being hit by Trey Hendrickson.  Ocie Rose jumped onto the ball in the end zone and after the successful FAU try, the Owls had managed to tie the game at 14.  With 8:03 remaining in the game, Florida took over, only to go [[three-and-out]].  Three plays into the ensuing Owls drive, however, Nick Washington forced a fumble that was recovered by [[Marcus Maye]] giving the Gators their third takeaway of the game.  Florida's offense once again stalled, however, and all of the drives that followed in the fourth quarter ended in punts before the Owls ran out the clock deep in their own territory to send the game into overtime.  Florida had the first possession of the overtime period and scored in three plays on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Treon Harris to [[Jake McGee]], but led only by 6 after Austin Hardin's extra point attempt was blocked.  Florida Atlantic would reach the 9-yard line before the Gators defense stuffed a quarterback run for a loss of three yards followed by forcing three consecutive incompletions to preserve a final 20\u201314 overtime lead.<ref name=\"FAU recap\">{{cite web |url=http://floridagators.com/news/2015/11/22/31770.aspx?path=football |title=Gators GameDay: No. 8 Florida 20, Florida Atlantic 14 (Final/Overtime) |date=November 22, 2015 |website=floridagators.com |publisher=[[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Assoc., Inc.]], [[Fox Sports Sun]] & [[IMG College]] |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe win gave [[Jim McElwain]] his tenth win with the Florida Gators, the most wins of any first year Florida coach.\n\n===Florida State===\n{{see also|2015 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Florida Gators|color=white}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Florida State Seminoles at Florida Gators \u2013 Game summary\n|date=November 28, 2015\n|time=7:37 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]]\n|road='''No. 14 Florida State'''\n|R1=0|R2=10|R3=3|R4=14\n|home=No. 10 Florida\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=2\n|stadium= [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] \u2022 [[Gainesville, Florida]]\n|attendance=90,916\n|weather=Temperature: {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} \u2022 Wind: ENE at {{convert|5|mph|km/h}} \u2022 Weather: 85% humidity\n|referee=Hubert Owens\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Mike Patrick]] and [[Ed Cunningham]]<ref name=\"FSU Pregame\">[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/notes/pre/20151128193000.pdf FSU Pregame]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|TV=[[ESPN College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN]]\n|reference=[http://www.gatorzone.com/football/boxscore.php?gameid=12762 Boxscore]\n|scoring=\n;Second Quarter\n*Florida State \u2013 [[Roberto Aguayo]] 45-yard field goal, 12:11\n*Florida State \u2013 Jeremy Kerr 1-yard pass from Sean Maguire (Roberto Aguayo kick), 7:47\n;Third Quarter\n*Florida State \u2013 Roberto Aguayo 51-yard field goal, 5:21\n;Fourth Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 Team safety, 8:58\n*Florida State \u2013 [[Dalvin Cook]] 15-yard run (Roberto Aguayo kick), 6:17\n*Florida State \u2013 Dalvin Cook 29-yard run (Roberto Aguayo kick), 0:20\n|stats=\n;Passing\n*FSU \u2013 Sean Maguire \u2013 14/28, 160 yards, 1 touchdown\n*FLA \u2013 [[Treon Harris]] \u2013 19/38, 134 yards\n;Rushing\n*FSU \u2013 [[Dalvin Cook]] \u2013 26 carries, 183 yards, 2 touchdowns\n*FLA \u2013 Kelvin Taylor \u2013 24 carries, 136 yards\n;Receiving\n*FSU \u2013 Kermit Whitfield \u2013 2 receptions, 52 yards\n*FLA \u2013 Jake McGee \u2013 4 receptions, 34 yards\n;Tackling\n*FSU \u2013 Derwin James, Reggie Northrup, Terrance Smith \u2013 9 tackles\n*FLA \u2013 Jarrad Davis and Keanu Neal \u2013 9 tackles\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Brazilian Navy is the largest navy in [[South America]] and in [[Latin America]], and the second largest navy in the [[Americas]], after the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2504-Oceanographic_and_Meteorological_Data_Buoys.html | title = Oceanographic and Meteorological Data Buoys | newspaper = Hydro International | accessdate = 2009-06-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517001914/http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2504-Oceanographic_and_Meteorological_Data_Buoys.html | archive-date = 2009-05-17 | url-status = live }}.</ref>\n\nThe navy was involved in [[War of Independence of Brazil#Naval action|Brazil's war of independence from Portugal]]. Most of [[Portugal]]'s naval forces and bases in South America were transferred to the newly independent country.  In the initial decades following independence, the country maintained a large naval force and the navy was later involved in the [[Cisplatine War]], the [[List of conflicts in South America|River Plate conflicts]], the [[Paraguayan War]] as well as other sporadic [[List of conflicts in South America|rebellions]] that marked Brazilian history.\n\nBy the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America. After the [[Revolta da Armada|1893 naval rebellion]], there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905, when Brazil acquired [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|two of the most powerful]] and advanced [[dreadnought]]s of the day which sparked a [[South American dreadnought race|dreadnought race with Brazil's South American neighbours]]. The Brazilian Navy participated in both [[Brazil and World War I|World War I]] and [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|World War II]], engaging in anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic.\n\nThe modern Brazilian Navy includes British-built guided missile [[frigate]]s (FFG), locally built [[corvette]]s (FFL), coastal diesel-electric [[submarine]]s (SSK) and many other river and coastal patrol craft.\n\n==Mission==\nIn addition to the roles of a traditional [[navy]], the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the [[merchant navy]] and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a [[coast guard]]. Other roles include:\n* Conducting national maritime policy\n* Implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragata_Nictheroy.jpg|thumb|left|Frigate ''Nictheroy'' chasing the Portuguese fleet during the war of independence.]]\n[[File:Marquis of tamandare 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|Patron of the Brazilian Navy [[Joaquim Marques Lisboa, Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9]], in 1873.]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Brazilian Navy date back to the [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese naval forces]] based in Brazil. The transfer of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese monarchy]] to Brazil in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars also resulted in the transfer of a large part of the structure, personnel and ships of the Portuguese Navy. These became the core of the Navy of Brazil.\n\n===Imperial Navy (1822\u20131889)===\n{{Main |Imperial Brazilian Navy}}\n\n====War of Independence====\n{{Main |Independence of Brazil#Independence War}}\n[[File:Treino da armada brasileira 1870.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ships of the Imperial Navy in training, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro, 1870s.]]\nThe Brazilian Navy came into being with the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of the country]]. Some of its members were native-born Brazilians, who under Portuguese rule had been forbidden to serve, while other members were Portuguese born who adhered to the cause of independence and foreign mercenaries. A number of establishments previously created by King [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]] were incorporated into the navy such as the Department of Navy, Headquarters of the Navy, the Intendancy and Accounting Department, the Arsenal (Shipyard) of the Navy, the Academy of Navy Guards, the Naval Hospital, the Auditorship, the Supreme Military Council, the powder plant, and others. The Brazilian-born Captain [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha Moreira]] was chosen as the first minister of the Navy on 28 October 1822.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 260}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 53}}\n\nBritish naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane]] was made the commander of the Brazilian Navy and received the rank of \"First Admiral\".{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 58\u201361}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}  At that time, the fleet was composed of one [[ship of the line]], four [[frigate]]s, and smaller ships for a total of 38 [[warship]]s. The Secretary of Treasury [[Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada]] created a national subscription to generate capital in order to increase the size of the fleet. Contributions were sent from all over Brazil. Even [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] acquired a merchant [[brig]] at his own expense (renamed ''Caboclo'') and donated it to the Navy.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 54\u201357}}  The navy fought in the north and also south of Brazil where it had a decisive role in the independence of the country.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}  After the suppression of the [[Confederation of the Equator|revolt in Pernambuco]] in 1824 and prior to the [[Cisplatine War]], the navy increased significantly in size and strength. Starting with 38 ships in 1822, eventually the navy had 96 modern warships of various types with over 690 cannon.\n\n====Cisplatine War and rebellions (1825\u20131849)====\n{{Main|Cisplatine War}}\n[[File:Passage_of_tonelero.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian warships ''Dom Pedro'', ''Dom Pedro II'', ''Dom Afonso'', ''Recife'', ''Dona Francisca'', ''Uni\u00e3o'' and ''Cal\u00edope'' passing through defences at The Tonelero.]]\nThe Navy blocked the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] hindering the contact of the United Provinces (as Argentina was then called) with the Cisplatine rebels who wanted Uruguay to join Argentina again or become an independent country, and the outside world. Several battles had occurred between Brazilian and Argentine ships until the defeat of an Argentine flotilla composed of two [[corvette]]s, five brigs and one [[barquentine]] near the Island of Santiago in 1827. The war came to a draw and in 1828 had to accept the independence of Uruguay. When Pedro I abdicated in 1831, he left a powerful navy made up of two ships of the line and ten [[frigate]]s in addition to corvettes, [[steamship]]s, and other ships for a total of at least 80 warships in peacetime.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 133\u201335}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}\n[[File:Steamship_dom_Afonso.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Artistic representation of the steam corvette Imperial ''Dom Afonso'' in 1850]]\nDuring the 58-year reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] the Brazilian Navy achieved its greatest strength in relation to navies around the world.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 216}}  The Arsenal, Navy department, and the Naval Jail were improved and the Imperial Marine Corps was created. Steam navigation was adopted. Brazil quickly modernized its fleet acquiring ships from foreign sources while also constructing ships locally. Brazil's Navy substituted the old [[smoothbore]] cannon for new ones with rifled barrels, which were more accurate and had longer ranges. Improvements were also made in the Arsenals (shipyards) and naval bases, which were equipped with new workshops.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}  Ships were constructed in the Naval Arsenal of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife, Santos, Niter\u00f3i and Pelotas. The Navy also successfully fought against all revolts that occurred during the Regency where it conducted blockades and transported the Army troops; including Cabanagem, [[Ragamuffin War]], [[Sabinada]], [[Balaiada]], amongst others.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 205\u20136}}\n\nWhen Emperor Pedro II was declared of legal age and assumed his constitutional prerogatives in 1840, the Armada had over 90 warships: six frigates, seven corvettes, two barque-schooners, six brigs, eight brig-schooners, 16 [[gunboat]]s, 12 schooners, seven armed brigantine-schooners, six steam [[barque]]s, three transport ships, two armed [[lugger]]s, two [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s and thirteen larger [[boat]]s.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 210}}\n\nDuring the 1850s the State Secretary, the Accounting Department of the Navy, the Headquarters of the Navy and the Naval Academy were reorganized and improved. New ships were purchased and the ports administrations were better equipped. The Imperial Mariner Corps was definitively regularized and the Marine Corps was created, taking the place of the Naval Artillery. The Service of Assistance for Invalids was also established, along with several schools for sailors and craftsmen.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | pp  = 207\u20138}}\n\n====Platine & Paraguayan wars (1849\u20131870)====\n{{Main|Paraguayan War}}\n\n[[File:O_Alagoas_passando_Humayta.png|thumb|right|A rare photograph of the Brazilian river monitor ''Alagoas'' passing Humait\u00e1, sometime in 1868, presumably after the fortress was captured. Notice the low profile presented to enemy artillery. From a soldier's photographic album preserved at the [[National Library of Brazil]].]]\nThe conflicts in the Platine region did not cease after the war of 1825. The anarchy caused by the despotic Rosas and his desire to subdue Bol\u00edvia, Uruguay and Paraguay [[Platine War|forced Brazil to intercede]].  The Brazilian Government sent a naval force of 17 warships (a ship of the line, 10 corvettes and six steamships) commanded by the veteran John Pascoe Grenfell.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 265}}  The Brazilian fleet [[Passage of the Tonelero|succeeded in passing]] through the Argentine line of defence at the Tonelero Pass under heavy attack and transported the troops to the theater of operations. The Brazilian Armada had a total of 59 vessels of various types in 1851: 36 armed sailing ships, 10 armed steamships, seven unarmed sailing ships and six sailing transports.{{Sfn | Carvalho | 1975 | p = 181}}\n[[File:Fragata_a_Vapor_Amazonas.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Amazonas'' steam frigate, 1870. It was the chief ship of the Imperial Navy in the famous Battle of the Riachuelo commanded by Admiral Francisco Manuel Barroso da Silva one of the most heroic figures of the Navy of Brazil.]]\nMore than a decade later the Armada was once again modernized and its fleet of old sailing ships was converted to a fleet of 40 steamships armed with more than 250 cannons.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 266}}  In 1864 the navy fought in the [[Uruguayan War]] and immediately afterwards in the [[Paraguayan War]] where it annihilated the Paraguayan navy in the [[Battle of Riachuelo]]. The navy was further augmented with the acquisition of 20 [[ironclad]]s and six fluvial [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]]. At least 9,177 navy personnel fought in the five years' conflict.{{Sfn | Salles | 2003 | p = 38}}  Brazilian naval constructors such as Napole\u00e3o Level, Trajano de Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Brasil planned new concepts for warships that allowed the country's Arsenals to retain their competitiveness with other nations.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 219}} All damage suffered by ships was repaired and various improvements were made to them.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} In 1870, Brazil had 94 modern warships{{Sfn | Schwarcz | 2002 | p = 305}} and had the fifth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 23}}\n\n====Expansion and the end of the Empire (1870\u20131889)====\nDuring the 1870s, the Brazilian Government strengthened the navy as the possibility of a war against Argentina over Paraguay's future became quite real. Thus, it acquired a [[gunboat]] and a corvette in 1873; an ironclad and a monitor in 1874; and immediately afterwards two [[cruiser]]s and another monitor.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 466}}  The improvement of the Armada continued during the 1880s. The Arsenals of the Navy in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, Par\u00e1 and Mato Grosso continued to build dozens of warships. Also, four torpedo boats were purchased.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 225}}\n[[File:Cruzador Almirante Barroso 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cruiser ''Almirante Barroso'', 1880.]]\n[[File:Encoura\u00e7ado_de_Esquadra_Riachuelo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian ''Riachuelo'' warship.]]\n[[File:Aquidaba_LOC_det_4a04853.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian ''Aquibad\u00e3'' warship.]]\nOn November 30, 1883, the Practical School of Torpedoes was created along with a workshop devoted to constructing and repairing torpedoes and electric devices in the Arsenal of Navy of Rio de Janeiro.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 221}}  This Arsenal constructed four steam gunboats and one schooner, all with iron and steel hulls (the first of these categories constructed in the country).{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 225}}  The Imperial Armada reached its apex with the incorporation of the ironclad [[battleship]]s {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Riachuelo||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidab\u00e3||2}} (both equipped with torpedo launchers) in 1884 and 1885, respectively. Both ships (considered state-of-the-art by experts from Europe) allowed the Brazilian Armada to retain its position as one of the most powerful naval forces.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 221, 227}}  By 1889, the navy had 60 warships{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} and was the fifth or sixth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Calmon | 2002 | p = 265}}\n\nIn the last cabinet of the monarchic regime, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Jos\u00e9 da Costa Azevedo]] (the Baron of Lad\u00e1rio), left the reorganization and modernization of the navy unfinished.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}}  The coup that ended the monarchy in Brazil in 1889 was not well accepted by the Armada. Imperial Mariners were attacked when they tried to support the imprisoned Emperor in the City Palace. The Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9 begged Pedro II to allow him to fight back the coup; however, the Emperor refused to allow any bloodshed.{{Sfn | Calmon | 1975 | p = 1603}}  Tamandar\u00e9 would later be imprisoned by order of the dictator [[Floriano Peixoto]] under the accusation of financing the monarchist military in the Federalist Revolution.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 66}}\n\nThe Baron of Lad\u00e1rio remained in contact with the exiled Imperial Family, hoping to restore the monarchy, but ended up ostracized by the republican government. Admiral Saldanha da Gama led the [[Revolta da Armada|Revolt of the Armada]] with the objective of restoring the Empire and allied himself with other monarchists who were fighting in the Federalist Revolution. However, all the attempts at restoration were violently crushed. High-ranking Monarchist officers were imprisoned, banished or executed by firing squad without due process of law and their subordinates also suffered harsh punishments.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 209}}\n\n===Early republic (1889\u20131917)===\n====Naval revolts====\n{{main|Revolta da Armada}}\n[[File:Aquidaban e Villegaignon.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian battleship Aquidab\u00e3]] (left corner) opening fire with the fortress Villegaignon during Armada Revolt, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro.]]\n[[File:Barroso_1896.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian protected cruiser ''Barroso''.]]\nThe military coup that led to the [[Empire of Brazil#Fall|proclamation of the Brazilian Republic]] (1889), accentuated the decline of shipbuilding in the country. For four decades, between 1890 and 1930 no new ships were built in Brazil. The focus of republican governments was to equip the army to fight internal uprisings in the new regime's early years. The Navy was perceived as a threat to the new republican regime, as it had been more loyal to the Monarchy.\n\nThe situation became precarious in just over a decade as the Naval Battalion was reduced to 295 soldiers and Imperial Marines to 1,904 men. The equipment and vessels acquired were considered outdated by Navy officials, who criticized the abandonment of repair shops.  Naval officers participated in two riots, known as [[Revolta da Armada|Naval Riots]].

The initial spark was provided on 21 November 1910 when [[Afro-Brazilian]] sailor [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]] was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of ''Minas Geraes'', ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', the twelve-year-old {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}}, and the new {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on ''Minas Geraes'' and one each on ''S\u00e3o Paulo'' and ''Bahia'' were killed.<ref>Morgan, \"The Revolt of the Lash,\" 32\u201338, 50.</ref>\n\nThe ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers\u2014led by [[Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Felisberto]]\u2014was the abolition of \"slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy\". They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including ''b\u00f4lo'' (being struck on the hand with a [[ferrule]]) and the use of whips or lashes (''chibata''), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By 23 November, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general [[amnesty]] for the sailors. Senator [[Ruy Barbosa]], long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref>Morgan, ''The Revolt of the Lash'', 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nHumiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on 24 November, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] with ten {{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. They planned to attack on the morning of 25 November, when the government expected the mutineers would return to [[Guanabara Bay]]. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125\u201323 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on 26 November.<ref>Morgan, \"The Revolt of the Lash,\" 44\u201346.</ref>\n\nDuring the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well-handled, despite a previous belief {{By whom|date=August 2019}} that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion.\n\n===World Wars (1917\u20131945)===\n====First World War (1917\u20131918)====\n{{Main|Brazil during World War I|U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Navy 1914.PNG|thumb|right|240px|Warship silhouettes of the Brazilian Navy, 1914]]\n[[File:GLAM MB Gibraltar (45024096524).jpg|thumb|left|The Destroyer ''Piau\u00ed'' in the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)]].]]\nAfter the declaration of war on the [[Central Powers]] in October 1917 the Brazilian Navy participated in the war.  On 21 December 1917 the British government requested that a Brazilian naval force of light cruisers be placed under Royal Navy control and a squadron comprising the cruisers ''Rio Grande do Sul'' and ''Bahia'', the destroyers ''Para\u00edba'', ''Rio Grande do Norte'', ''Piau\u00ed'', and ''Santa Catarina'', and the support ship ''Belmonte'' and the ocean-going [[tugboat]] ''Laurindo Pitta'' was formed, designated the ''Divis\u00e3o Naval em Opera\u00e7\u00f5es de Guerra'' (\"Naval Division in [[War Operations]]\"). The DNOG sailed on 31 July 1918 from [[Fernando de Noronha]] for [[Sierra Leone]], arriving at [[Freetown]] on 9 August, and sailing onwards to its new base of operations, [[Dakar]], on 23 August. On the night of 25 August the division believed it had been attacked by a [[U-boat]] when the [[auxiliary cruiser]] ''Belmonte'' sighted a torpedo track. The purported submarine was [[Depth charge|depth-charged]], fired on, and reportedly sunk by ''Rio Grande do Norte'', but the sinking was never confirmed.\n[[File:GLAM MB Cruzador Rio Grande do Sul (43931430200).jpg|thumb|right|Cruiser ''Rio Grande do Sul'' escorting naval convoy during World War I.]]\nThe DNOG patrolled the Dakar\u2013[[Cape Verde]]\u2013[[Gibraltar]] triangle, which was suspected to be used by U-boats waiting on convoys, until 3 November 1918 when it sailed for Gibraltar to begin operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], with the exception of ''Rio Grande do Sul'', ''Rio Grande do Norte'', and ''Belmonte''.

In early 1942, German submarines aimed to interdict supplies from reaching Britain and the Soviet Union. Between 1942 and 1944, Brazil's navy was supported by the United States Navy. During this period several naval bases were established in the North and Northeast of Brazil, becoming the headquarters of the Allied Command Atlantic South.\n\nWithin their limitations and with the refitting and reorganization promoted with American resources, the Brazilian Navy participated actively in the fight [[anti-submarine|against U-boats]] in the [[South Atlantic|South]], Central Atlantic and also the [[Caribbean]]. They guarded [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[convoy]]s bound for [[North Africa]] and the Mediterranean. Between 1942 and 1945 the navy was responsible for conducting 574 convoy operations protecting 3,164 merchant ships of various nationalities. Enemy submarines managed to sink only three vessels. According to German documentation the Brazilian Navy made over sixty-six attacks against German submarines.\n\nA total of nine U-boats known German submarines were destroyed along the Brazilian coast.

Local fishermen complained that large boats were coming from France to catch lobster off the state of Pernambuco, so the Brazilian Admiral Arnoldo Toscano ordered two corvettes to sail to the area where the French fishing boats were located. Seeing that the fishermen's claim was justifiable, the captain of the Brazilian vessel then demanded that the French boats retreat to deeper water, leaving the continental shelf to smaller Brazilian vessels. The situation became very tense once the French rejected this demand and radioed a message asking for the French government to send a destroyer to accompany the lobster boats, which prompted the Brazilian government to put fleet in a state of alert.\n\nThe French Government dispatched a {{sclass2-|T 53|destroyer|2}} on 21 February to watch over the French fishing boats.

The Brazilian Navy is the largest navy in [[South America]] and in [[Latin America]], and the second largest navy in the [[Americas]], after the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2504-Oceanographic_and_Meteorological_Data_Buoys.html | title = Oceanographic and Meteorological Data Buoys | newspaper = Hydro International | accessdate = 2009-06-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517001914/http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2504-Oceanographic_and_Meteorological_Data_Buoys.html | archive-date = 2009-05-17 | url-status = live }}.</ref>\n\nThe navy was involved in [[War of Independence of Brazil#Naval action|Brazil's war of independence from Portugal]]. Most of [[Portugal]]'s naval forces and bases in South America were transferred to the newly independent country.  In the initial decades following independence, the country maintained a large naval force and the navy was later involved in the [[Cisplatine War]], the [[List of conflicts in South America|River Plate conflicts]], the [[Paraguayan War]] as well as other sporadic [[List of conflicts in South America|rebellions]] that marked Brazilian history.\n\nBy the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America. After the [[Revolta da Armada|1893 naval rebellion]], there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905, when Brazil acquired [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|two of the most powerful]] and advanced [[dreadnought]]s of the day which sparked a [[South American dreadnought race|dreadnought race with Brazil's South American neighbours]]. The Brazilian Navy participated in both [[Brazil and World War I|World War I]] and [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|World War II]], engaging in anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic.\n\nThe modern Brazilian Navy includes British-built guided missile [[frigate]]s (FFG), locally built [[corvette]]s (FFL), coastal diesel-electric [[submarine]]s (SSK) and many other river and coastal patrol craft.\n\n==Mission==\nIn addition to the roles of a traditional [[navy]], the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the [[merchant navy]] and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a [[coast guard]]. Other roles include:\n* Conducting national maritime policy\n* Implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragata_Nictheroy.jpg|thumb|left|Frigate ''Nictheroy'' chasing the Portuguese fleet during the war of independence.]]\n[[File:Marquis of tamandare 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|Patron of the Brazilian Navy [[Joaquim Marques Lisboa, Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9]], in 1873.]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Brazilian Navy date back to the [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese naval forces]] based in Brazil. The transfer of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese monarchy]] to Brazil in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars also resulted in the transfer of a large part of the structure, personnel and ships of the Portuguese Navy. These became the core of the Navy of Brazil.\n\n===Imperial Navy (1822\u20131889)===\n{{Main |Imperial Brazilian Navy}}\n\n====War of Independence====\n{{Main |Independence of Brazil#Independence War}}\n[[File:Treino da armada brasileira 1870.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ships of the Imperial Navy in training, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro, 1870s.]]\nThe Brazilian Navy came into being with the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of the country]]. Some of its members were native-born Brazilians, who under Portuguese rule had been forbidden to serve, while other members were Portuguese born who adhered to the cause of independence and foreign mercenaries. A number of establishments previously created by King [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]] were incorporated into the navy such as the Department of Navy, Headquarters of the Navy, the Intendancy and Accounting Department, the Arsenal (Shipyard) of the Navy, the Academy of Navy Guards, the Naval Hospital, the Auditorship, the Supreme Military Council, the powder plant, and others. The Brazilian-born Captain [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha Moreira]] was chosen as the first minister of the Navy on 28 October 1822.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 260}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 53}}\n\nBritish naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane]] was made the commander of the Brazilian Navy and received the rank of \"First Admiral\".{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 58\u201361}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}  At that time, the fleet was composed of one [[ship of the line]], four [[frigate]]s, and smaller ships for a total of 38 [[warship]]s. The Secretary of Treasury [[Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada]] created a national subscription to generate capital in order to increase the size of the fleet. Contributions were sent from all over Brazil. Even [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] acquired a merchant [[brig]] at his own expense (renamed ''Caboclo'') and donated it to the Navy.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 261}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 54\u201357}}  The navy fought in the north and also south of Brazil where it had a decisive role in the independence of the country.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}  After the suppression of the [[Confederation of the Equator|revolt in Pernambuco]] in 1824 and prior to the [[Cisplatine War]], the navy increased significantly in size and strength. Starting with 38 ships in 1822, eventually the navy had 96 modern warships of various types with over 690 cannon.\n\n====Cisplatine War and rebellions (1825\u20131849)====\n{{Main|Cisplatine War}}\n[[File:Passage_of_tonelero.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian warships ''Dom Pedro'', ''Dom Pedro II'', ''Dom Afonso'', ''Recife'', ''Dona Francisca'', ''Uni\u00e3o'' and ''Cal\u00edope'' passing through defences at The Tonelero.]]\nThe Navy blocked the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] hindering the contact of the United Provinces (as Argentina was then called) with the Cisplatine rebels who wanted Uruguay to join Argentina again or become an independent country, and the outside world. Several battles had occurred between Brazilian and Argentine ships until the defeat of an Argentine flotilla composed of two [[corvette]]s, five brigs and one [[barquentine]] near the Island of Santiago in 1827. The war came to a draw and in 1828 had to accept the independence of Uruguay. When Pedro I abdicated in 1831, he left a powerful navy made up of two ships of the line and ten [[frigate]]s in addition to corvettes, [[steamship]]s, and other ships for a total of at least 80 warships in peacetime.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 133\u201335}}{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}\n[[File:Steamship_dom_Afonso.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Artistic representation of the steam corvette Imperial ''Dom Afonso'' in 1850]]\nDuring the 58-year reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] the Brazilian Navy achieved its greatest strength in relation to navies around the world.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 216}}  The Arsenal, Navy department, and the Naval Jail were improved and the Imperial Marine Corps was created. Steam navigation was adopted. Brazil quickly modernized its fleet acquiring ships from foreign sources while also constructing ships locally. Brazil's Navy substituted the old [[smoothbore]] cannon for new ones with rifled barrels, which were more accurate and had longer ranges. Improvements were also made in the Arsenals (shipyards) and naval bases, which were equipped with new workshops.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}  Ships were constructed in the Naval Arsenal of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife, Santos, Niter\u00f3i and Pelotas. The Navy also successfully fought against all revolts that occurred during the Regency where it conducted blockades and transported the Army troops; including Cabanagem, [[Ragamuffin War]], [[Sabinada]], [[Balaiada]], amongst others.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 264}}{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 205\u20136}}\n\nWhen Emperor Pedro II was declared of legal age and assumed his constitutional prerogatives in 1840, the Armada had over 90 warships: six frigates, seven corvettes, two barque-schooners, six brigs, eight brig-schooners, 16 [[gunboat]]s, 12 schooners, seven armed brigantine-schooners, six steam [[barque]]s, three transport ships, two armed [[lugger]]s, two [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s and thirteen larger [[boat]]s.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 210}}\n\nDuring the 1850s the State Secretary, the Accounting Department of the Navy, the Headquarters of the Navy and the Naval Academy were reorganized and improved. New ships were purchased and the ports administrations were better equipped. The Imperial Mariner Corps was definitively regularized and the Marine Corps was created, taking the place of the Naval Artillery. The Service of Assistance for Invalids was also established, along with several schools for sailors and craftsmen.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | pp  = 207\u20138}}\n\n====Platine & Paraguayan wars (1849\u20131870)====\n{{Main|Paraguayan War}}\n\n[[File:O_Alagoas_passando_Humayta.png|thumb|right|A rare photograph of the Brazilian river monitor ''Alagoas'' passing Humait\u00e1, sometime in 1868, presumably after the fortress was captured.

From a soldier's photographic album preserved at the [[National Library of Brazil]].]]\nThe conflicts in the Platine region did not cease after the war of 1825. The anarchy caused by the despotic Rosas and his desire to subdue Bol\u00edvia, Uruguay and Paraguay [[Platine War|forced Brazil to intercede]].  The Brazilian Government sent a naval force of 17 warships (a ship of the line, 10 corvettes and six steamships) commanded by the veteran John Pascoe Grenfell.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 265}}  The Brazilian fleet [[Passage of the Tonelero|succeeded in passing]] through the Argentine line of defence at the Tonelero Pass under heavy attack and transported the troops to the theater of operations. The Brazilian Armada had a total of 59 vessels of various types in 1851: 36 armed sailing ships, 10 armed steamships, seven unarmed sailing ships and six sailing transports.{{Sfn | Carvalho | 1975 | p = 181}}\n[[File:Fragata_a_Vapor_Amazonas.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Amazonas'' steam frigate, 1870.

The navy was further augmented with the acquisition of 20 [[ironclad]]s and six fluvial [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]]. At least 9,177 navy personnel fought in the five years' conflict.{{Sfn | Salles | 2003 | p = 38}}  Brazilian naval constructors such as Napole\u00e3o Level, Trajano de Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Brasil planned new concepts for warships that allowed the country's Arsenals to retain their competitiveness with other nations.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 219}} All damage suffered by ships was repaired and various improvements were made to them.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} In 1870, Brazil had 94 modern warships{{Sfn | Schwarcz | 2002 | p = 305}} and had the fifth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 23}}\n\n====Expansion and the end of the Empire (1870\u20131889)====\nDuring the 1870s, the Brazilian Government strengthened the navy as the possibility of a war against Argentina over Paraguay's future became quite real. Thus, it acquired a [[gunboat]] and a corvette in 1873; an ironclad and a monitor in 1874; and immediately afterwards two [[cruiser]]s and another monitor.{{Sfn | de Holanda | 1974 | p = 272}}{{Sfn | Doratioto | 2002 | p = 466}}  The improvement of the Armada continued during the 1880s. The Arsenals of the Navy in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, Par\u00e1 and Mato Grosso continued to build dozens of warships. Also, four torpedo boats were purchased.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 225}}\n[[File:Cruzador Almirante Barroso 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cruiser ''Almirante Barroso'', 1880.]]\n[[File:Encoura\u00e7ado_de_Esquadra_Riachuelo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian ''Riachuelo'' warship.]]\n[[File:Aquidaba_LOC_det_4a04853.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian ''Aquibad\u00e3'' warship.]]\nOn November 30, 1883, the Practical School of Torpedoes was created along with a workshop devoted to constructing and repairing torpedoes and electric devices in the Arsenal of Navy of Rio de Janeiro.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 221}}  This Arsenal constructed four steam gunboats and one schooner, all with iron and steel hulls (the first of these categories constructed in the country).{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | p = 225}}  The Imperial Armada reached its apex with the incorporation of the ironclad [[battleship]]s {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Riachuelo||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidab\u00e3||2}} (both equipped with torpedo launchers) in 1884 and 1885, respectively. Both ships (considered state-of-the-art by experts from Europe) allowed the Brazilian Armada to retain its position as one of the most powerful naval forces.{{Sfn | Maia | 1975 | pp = 221, 227}}  By 1889, the navy had 60 warships{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}} and was the fifth or sixth most powerful navy in the world.{{Sfn | Calmon | 2002 | p = 265}}\n\nIn the last cabinet of the monarchic regime, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Jos\u00e9 da Costa Azevedo]] (the Baron of Lad\u00e1rio), left the reorganization and modernization of the navy unfinished.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 208}}  The coup that ended the monarchy in Brazil in 1889 was not well accepted by the Armada. Imperial Mariners were attacked when they tried to support the imprisoned Emperor in the City Palace. The Marquis of Tamandar\u00e9 begged Pedro II to allow him to fight back the coup; however, the Emperor refused to allow any bloodshed.{{Sfn | Calmon | 1975 | p = 1603}}  Tamandar\u00e9 would later be imprisoned by order of the dictator [[Floriano Peixoto]] under the accusation of financing the monarchist military in the Federalist Revolution.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 66}}\n\nThe Baron of Lad\u00e1rio remained in contact with the exiled Imperial Family, hoping to restore the monarchy, but ended up ostracized by the republican government. Admiral Saldanha da Gama led the [[Revolta da Armada|Revolt of the Armada]] with the objective of restoring the Empire and allied himself with other monarchists who were fighting in the Federalist Revolution. However, all the attempts at restoration were violently crushed. High-ranking Monarchist officers were imprisoned, banished or executed by firing squad without due process of law and their subordinates also suffered harsh punishments.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | p = 209}}\n\n===Early republic (1889\u20131917)===\n====Naval revolts====\n{{main|Revolta da Armada}}\n[[File:Aquidaban e Villegaignon.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian battleship Aquidab\u00e3]] (left corner) opening fire with the fortress Villegaignon during Armada Revolt, [[Guanabara Bay]], Rio de Janeiro.]]\n[[File:Barroso_1896.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brazilian protected cruiser ''Barroso''.]]\nThe military coup that led to the [[Empire of Brazil#Fall|proclamation of the Brazilian Republic]] (1889), accentuated the decline of shipbuilding in the country. For four decades, between 1890 and 1930 no new ships were built in Brazil. The focus of republican governments was to equip the army to fight internal uprisings in the new regime's early years. The Navy was perceived as a threat to the new republican regime, as it had been more loyal to the Monarchy.\n\nThe situation became precarious in just over a decade as the Naval Battalion was reduced to 295 soldiers and Imperial Marines to 1,904 men. The equipment and vessels acquired were considered outdated by Navy officials, who criticized the abandonment of repair shops.  Naval officers participated in two riots, known as [[Revolta da Armada|Naval Riots]]. The second, avowedly monarchist, cost the officers their careers and their lives, without entering the military justice process. The sailors who obeyed orders and took part in the attempt to restore monarchy suffered cruelly.{{Sfn | Janotti | 1986 | ps =.

The initial spark was provided on 21 November 1910 when [[Afro-Brazilian]] sailor [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]] was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of ''Minas Geraes'', ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', the twelve-year-old {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}}, and the new {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on ''Minas Geraes'' and one each on ''S\u00e3o Paulo'' and ''Bahia'' were killed.<ref>Morgan, \"The Revolt of the Lash,\" 32\u201338, 50.</ref>\n\nThe ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers\u2014led by [[Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Felisberto]]\u2014was the abolition of \"slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy\". They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including ''b\u00f4lo'' (being struck on the hand with a [[ferrule]]) and the use of whips or lashes (''chibata''), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By 23 November, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general [[amnesty]] for the sailors. Senator [[Ruy Barbosa]], long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref>Morgan, ''The Revolt of the Lash'', 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nHumiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on 24 November, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] with ten {{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. They planned to attack on the morning of 25 November, when the government expected the mutineers would return to [[Guanabara Bay]].

In early 1942, German submarines aimed to interdict supplies from reaching Britain and the Soviet Union. Between 1942 and 1944, Brazil's navy was supported by the United States Navy. During this period several naval bases were established in the North and Northeast of Brazil, becoming the headquarters of the Allied Command Atlantic South.\n\nWithin their limitations and with the refitting and reorganization promoted with American resources, the Brazilian Navy participated actively in the fight [[anti-submarine|against U-boats]] in the [[South Atlantic|South]], Central Atlantic and also the [[Caribbean]]. They guarded [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[convoy]]s bound for [[North Africa]] and the Mediterranean. Between 1942 and 1945 the navy was responsible for conducting 574 convoy operations protecting 3,164 merchant ships of various nationalities. Enemy submarines managed to sink only three vessels. According to German documentation the Brazilian Navy made over sixty-six attacks against German submarines.\n\nA total of nine U-boats known German submarines were destroyed along the Brazilian coast.

Local fishermen complained that large boats were coming from France to catch lobster off the state of Pernambuco, so the Brazilian Admiral Arnoldo Toscano ordered two corvettes to sail to the area where the French fishing boats were located. Seeing that the fishermen's claim was justifiable, the captain of the Brazilian vessel then demanded that the French boats retreat to deeper water, leaving the continental shelf to smaller Brazilian vessels. The situation became very tense once the French rejected this demand and radioed a message asking for the French government to send a destroyer to accompany the lobster boats, which prompted the Brazilian government to put fleet in a state of alert.\n\nThe French Government dispatched a {{sclass2-|T 53|destroyer|2}} on 21 February to watch over the French fishing boats.

The dissatisfaction with officialdom and conservative politicians, coupled with the lack of vision and inability of the general policy of then president [[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]], led the sailors, encouraged by leaders such as Corporal Anselmo, to the military coup of 1964.\n\nThe purges carried out later (not just the navy but for all the armed forces), and the establishment of certain criteria for selection of its new members were a military term in the Brazilian tradition among its members openly harboring various currents of political thought.\n\nThe {{sclass-|Colossus|aircraft carrier|2}} ''Minas Gerais'' served the Navy until its decommissioning in 2001.\n\nThe carrier was commissioned as NAeL ''Minas Gerais'' (named for Kubitschek's home state) on 6 December 1960.

Cyanide is quickly metabolized to 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid and [[thiocyanate]] with a [[half life]] of 10\u201330 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism.  Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys.  Thiocyanate possesses ~0.01% the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLactate concentrations above 10&nbsp;mmol per liter are an indicator of cyanide poisoning, as defined by the presence of a blood cyanide concentration above 40 mumol per liter. Lactate levels greater than 6&nbsp;mmol/L after reported or strongly suspected pure cyanide poisoning, such as cyanide-containing smoke exposure, suggests significant cyanide exposure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leybell |first1=Inna |title=Cyanide Toxicity Workup |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-workup |website=Medscape |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMethods of detection include colorimetric assays such as the [[Prussian blue (medical use)|Prussian blue]] test, the pyridine-barbiturate assay, also known as the \"Conway diffusion method\"<ref>Forensic Toxicology: Principles and Concepts By Nicholas T Lappas, Courtney M Lappas, Chapter 10.</ref> and the taurine fluorescence-HPLC but like all colorimetric assays these are prone to false positives.  Lipid peroxidation resulting in \"[[TBARS]],\" an artifact of heart attack produces dialdehydes that cross-react with the pyridine-barbiturate assay.  Meanwhile, the taurine-fluorescence-HPLC assay used for cyanide detection is identical to the assay used to detect glutathione in spinal fluid.\n\nCyanide and thiocyanate assays have been run with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which are considered specific tests.

In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).\n|-\n| [[Dicobalt edetate]]\n| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnosis of cyanide poisoning.

Cyanide reacts at a higher level with high stomach [[acidity]].\n\n*On 26 January 1904, company promoter and swindler [[Whitaker Wright]] committed suicide by ingesting cyanide in a court anteroom immediately after being convicted of fraud.\n* In February 1937, the Uruguayan short story writer [[Horacio Quiroga]] committed suicide by drinking cyanide in a hospital at [[Buenos Aires]].\n* In 1937, polymer chemist [[Wallace Carothers]] committed suicide by cyanide.\n* In the 1943 [[Operation Gunnerside]] to destroy the Vemork Heavy Water Plant in World War II (an attempt to stop or slow German atomic bomb progress), the commandos were given cyanide tablets (cyanide enclosed in rubber) kept in the mouth and were instructed to bite into them in case of German capture. The tablets ensured death within three minutes.<ref>\"Operation Gunnerside\" in the book ''Bomb: The Race to Build&nbsp;\u2013 and Steal&nbsp;\u2013 the World's Most Dangerous Weapon''</ref>\n* Cyanide, in the form of pure liquid [[prussic acid]] (a historical name for hydrogen cyanide), was the favored [[suicide agent]] of the [[Third Reich]]. It was used to commit suicide by [[Erwin Rommel]] (1944), [[Adolf Hitler]]'s wife, [[Eva Braun]] (1945), and by Nazi leaders [[Heinrich Himmler]] (1945), possibly [[Martin Bormann]] (1945), and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] (1946).\n* It is speculated that, in 1954, [[Alan Turing]] used an apple that had been injected with a solution of cyanide to commit suicide after being convicted of having a homosexual relationship\u2014illegal at the time in the UK\u2014and forced to undergo hormonal castration.\n* Members of the Sri Lankan [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] ([[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], whose [[LTTE Insurgency|insurgency]] lasted from 1983 to 2009), used to wear cyanide vials around their necks with the intention of committing suicide if captured by the government forces.\n*On 18 November 1978, [[Jonestown]]. A total of 909 individuals died in Jonestown, many from apparent cyanide poisoning, in an event termed \"revolutionary suicide\" by Jones and some members on an audio tape of the event and in prior discussions. The poisonings in Jonestown followed the murder of five others by Temple members at Port Kaituma, including United States Congressman Leo Ryan, an act that Jones ordered. Four other Temple members committed murder-suicide in Georgetown at Jones' command.\n* On 6 June 1985, serial killer [[Leonard Lake]] died in custody after having ingested cyanide pills he had sewn into his clothes. \n* On 28 June 2012, Wall Street trader [[Michael Marin]] ingested a cyanide pill seconds after a guilty verdict was read in his arson trial in Phoenix, AZ; he died minutes after.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57481400-504083/michael-marin-former-wall-street-trader-took-cyanide-after-arson-conviction-says-autopsy/ | publisher=CBS News | title=Michael Marin, former Wall Street trader, took cyanide after arson conviction, says autopsy | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727233413/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57481400-504083/michael-marin-former-wall-street-trader-took-cyanide-after-arson-conviction-says-autopsy/ | archivedate=27 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* On 22 June 2015, John B.

Cyanide is quickly metabolized to 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid and [[thiocyanate]] with a [[half life]] of 10\u201330 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism.  Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys.  Thiocyanate possesses ~0.01% the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLactate concentrations above 10&nbsp;mmol per liter are an indicator of cyanide poisoning, as defined by the presence of a blood cyanide concentration above 40 mumol per liter. Lactate levels greater than 6&nbsp;mmol/L after reported or strongly suspected pure cyanide poisoning, such as cyanide-containing smoke exposure, suggests significant cyanide exposure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leybell |first1=Inna |title=Cyanide Toxicity Workup |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-workup |website=Medscape |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMethods of detection include colorimetric assays such as the [[Prussian blue (medical use)|Prussian blue]] test, the pyridine-barbiturate assay, also known as the \"Conway diffusion method\"<ref>Forensic Toxicology: Principles and Concepts By Nicholas T Lappas, Courtney M Lappas, Chapter 10.</ref> and the taurine fluorescence-HPLC but like all colorimetric assays these are prone to false positives.  Lipid peroxidation resulting in \"[[TBARS]],\" an artifact of heart attack produces dialdehydes that cross-react with the pyridine-barbiturate assay.  Meanwhile, the taurine-fluorescence-HPLC assay used for cyanide detection is identical to the assay used to detect glutathione in spinal fluid.\n\nCyanide and thiocyanate assays have been run with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which are considered specific tests. Since cyanide has a short half-life, the main metabolite, thiocyanate is typically measured to determine exposure. Other methods of detection include the identification of plasma lactate.\n\n==Treatment==\n===Decontamination===\nDecontamination of people exposed to hydrogen cyanide gas only requires removal of the outer clothing and the washing of their hair.<ref name=NIH2015/> Those exposed to liquids or powders generally require [[Human decontamination|full decontamination]].<ref name=NIH2015/>\n\n===Antidote===\nThe United States standard cyanide [[antidote]] kit first uses a small inhaled dose of [[amyl nitrite]], followed by intravenous [[sodium nitrite]], followed by intravenous [[sodium thiosulfate]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|814287|Toxicity, Cyanide|overview}}</ref> [[Hydroxocobalamin]] is newly approved in the US and is available in Cyanokit antidote kits.<ref name=EmedTreat>{{EMedicine|article|814287|Toxicity, Cyanide|treatment}}</ref> [[Sulfanegen TEA]], which could be delivered to the body through an intra-muscular (IM) injection, detoxifies cyanide and converts the cyanide into [[thiocyanate]], a less toxic substance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/antidote-cyanide-found-132827160.html |title=New Antidote for Cyanide Found |accessdate=14 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305003617/http://news.yahoo.com/antidote-cyanide-found-132827160.html |archivedate=5 March 2016  }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Alternative methods of treating cyanide intoxication are used in other countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, this reaction occurs too slowly in the body for thiosulfate to be adequate by itself in acute cyanide poisoning. Thiosulfate must therefore be used in combination with nitrites.<ref name=\"emedicine.medscape.com\"/>\n|-cyanide can be found on a silver back lizard frog from the village called Bodelwyddan in the north of Wales.\n| [[Hydroxocobalamin]]\n|[[Hydroxocobalamin]], a form (or [[vitamer]]) of [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] made by bacteria, and sometimes denoted vitamin B<sub>12a</sub>, is used to bind cyanide to form the harmless [[cyanocobalamin]] form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. \n|-\n| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]]\n| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]] (4-DMAP) has been proposed{{By whom|date=May 2010}} in Germany as a more rapid antidote than nitrites with (reportedly) lower toxicity.  4-DMAP is used currently by the German military and by the civilian population.  In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).\n|-\n| [[Dicobalt edetate]]\n| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnosis of cyanide poisoning. Because of its side effects, it should be reserved only for patients with the most severe degree of exposure to cyanide; otherwise, nitrite/thiosulfate is preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=209160 |name-list-format=vanc|year=1978 |last1=Nagler |first1=J |last2=Provoost |first2=RA |last3=Parizel |first3=G |title=Hydrogen cyanide poisoning: Treatment with cobalt EDTA |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=414\u20136 |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Glucose]]\n| Evidence from animal experiments suggests that coadministration of [[glucose]] protects against cobalt toxicity associated with the antidote agent dicobalt edetate.
