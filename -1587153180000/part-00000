(''Kaap Pieter Boreels'' was renamed [[Cape Egmont]] by Captain [[James Cook]] 125 years later.)\n\n=== Return voyage ===\n[[File:Tasman-dagboek-b.jpg|thumb|[[Tongatapu]], the main island of [[Tonga]]; drawing by [[Isaack Gilsemans]]]]\n[[File:Tasman-dagboek-a.jpg|thumb|The bay of Tongatapu with the two ships; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans]]\n\nEn route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the [[Tonga]]n archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]] Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of [[Vanua Levu]] and Cikobia before making his way back into the open sea.\n\nThe expedition turned north-west towards [[New Guinea]] and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Second major voyage ==\nTasman left [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (''Limmen'', ''Zeemeeuw'' and the tender ''Braek''). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. However, he missed the [[Torres Strait]] between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], and its people.<ref name=Quanchi>Quanchi, ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', page 237</ref> He arrived back in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in August 1644.\n\nFrom the point of view of the [[Dutch East India Company]], Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman did not fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abel Tasman's great voyage|url=http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=0x000ae4f7|work=Abel Tasman's great voyage|publisher=Tai Awatea-Knowledge Net|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> Tasman explained he had found a country with covered with lush vegetation and freshwater however was chased away by the savage natives who were still living like cavemen. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans \u2013 mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.\n\n== Later life ==\nOn 2 November 1644 Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now [[Thailand]]) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to [[Manila]] to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage.

By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman's suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref>\n\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}<!--need citations for things that are not obviously after him and those without articles-->\n[[File:AbelTasmanNP.jpg|thumb|[[Abel Tasman National Park]]]]\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0430, \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0410. \u0422\u0430\u0441\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043e. \u0422\u043e\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0443.jpg|thumb|Memorial stele erected in honor of the visit of Abel Tasman to Tongatapu Island]]\nMultiple places have been named after Tasman, including:\n*the Australian island and state of [[Tasmania]], renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen's land.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [https://www.andamanbliss.com/ authenticity], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Manzar Bashir\">([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes])</ref><ref name=\"Manzar Bashir2\">(Fagence, http://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{|date=April 2020}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0.htm|title=Ulfat ki ksi dahleez per, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R.

(2007). \"Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark\". ''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839\u2013854.</ref>\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592\u2013608.</ref>\n\n=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/>  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.<ref name=\"Wyllie\">Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R.

''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T.

''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3\u20137.</ref> Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''.

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [https://www.andamanbliss.com/ authenticity], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Manzar Bashir\">([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes])</ref><ref name=\"Manzar Bashir2\">(Fagence, http://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{|date=April 2020}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0.htm|title=Ulfat ki ksi dahleez per, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R. (2015). ''Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World'' (pp. 1\u201320). London: WTO.</ref> The GDP increase comes from the over one billion international tourists worldwide, a number that has been growing by 5 percent annually since 2012.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\">Muchapondwa, E., & Stage, J. (2013). \"The economic impacts of tourism in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa: Is poverty subsiding?\", ''Natural Resources Forum'', 37(2), 80\u201389.</ref><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\">Norjanah, Mohd B., Jaafar Mastura, and Mohamad Diana.

''SHS Web of Conferences'', vol. 12, 2014, p. 01100</ref> Visits and boosts to GDP are expected to continue to rise in the near future as falling oil prices contribute to reduced living costs and increased available income for households, as well as reduced costs for air travel.\n\nTourism can be divided into subcategories into which impacts fall: spending from visitors on tourism experiences like beach holidays and theme parks (domestic and international), spending on leisure items like bicycles, business spending, and capital investment.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\">Zhang, J., Madsen, B., & Jensen-Butler, C. (2007). \"Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark\". ''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839\u2013854.</ref>\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D. (2016). \"Tourism, ecotourism and protected areas\". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M. Needham (eds.), ''Parks and protected areas in Canada: Planning and management'' (4th ed) (pp. 391 \u2013 425). Toronto: Oxford University Press</ref> For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination. That individual goes on to spend that dollar on lunch from a local vendor, and that vendor goes on to spend it locally.<ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\">Wagner, J. E. (1997). \"Estimating the economic impacts of tourism\". ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592\u2013608.</ref>\n\n=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/>  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.<ref name=\"Wyllie\">Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). \"Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach\". ''Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication'', Number 2. ''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T. J., & Johnston, R. J. (2006). \"The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue\". ''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3\u20137.</ref> Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''. Routledge.</ref> This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

Under awkward and unfortunate circumstances, he becomes trapped in a restaurant bathroom with Mina ([[Alba Rohrwacher]]), who works at the Italian embassy. Despite the uncomfortable and slightly humorous first encounter, Jude and Mina form a strong relationship and move in together.\n\nA few months later, Mina wakes to a phone call from her employer. They notify her that she has been transferred and will be relocated to her native Italy in two months, separating her from Jude. Upon learning of the impending transfer, Jude is deeply upset, and later in the day initiates a sexual encounter. Against Mina\u2019s wishes, Jude ejaculates inside of her, and Mina later discovers she is pregnant. Jude and Mina are married at a beachside cafe. After the reception, a man shoots a deer on the boardwalk outside. Mina is distraught after witnessing the unnecessary and careless death of an animal, and is bothered by recurring nightmares of the instance.\n\nAs the pregnancy begins, Mina fails to maintain a stable diet. At a friend\u2019s art exhibit, Mina wanders outside to the patio and faints. She is taken to the hospital, where an ultrasound is performed and Mina and Jude are informed that their baby is not receiving adequate nutrients to grow. The couple return home, where Mina expresses a distrust of modern medicine. She decides to employ only [[alternative medicine]], going so far as to visit a psychic who informs Mina that her fetus is an [[Indigo child]]. Trusting her maternal instincts, Jude does not initially intervene with Mina\u2019s self-inflicted undernourishment and shunning of western treatment options.\n\nMina continues to undernourish herself and her unborn child, and when it is time for her to give birth, contractions do not begin due to her malnourishment. As the baby goes into distress, Jude takes Mina to the hospital where a [[c-section]] is performed against her wishes. The baby boy is weak and must begin his life inside an [[neonatal incubator|incubator]]. \n\nSeven months later, Mina has not allowed her son to be taken outside of the apartment. Over a growing obsession with purity and cleanliness, Mina does not allow outsiders to touch her baby without first washing their hands, requires all cell phones be left at the bottom of the entryway stairs, and keeps the infant to a vegan diet. She continues to renounce modern medicine. While Mina is gone, Jude takes the baby to a doctor who informs him that the baby is severely malnourished, and at risk of retarded growth or death. Jude returns home and confronts Mina about her parenting style. The rift between the two grows larger. Mina is horrified when she returns home to find Jude feeding their baby a meat product, and after an argument during which Jude slaps Mina, she agrees to allow Jude to take charge of feeding the baby.\n\nAfter two weeks of following the prescribed diet, the baby has not gained any weight. Jude is suspicious of Mina, who takes the baby away after every meal. Jude discovers that Mina, gaunt and withered herself, has been feeding the baby an [[anti-nutrient]] oil, preventing him from absorbing food. Jude finds excuses throughout each day to take the infant outside and feed him in secret. While visiting, Jude\u2019s mother becomes aware of the situation and urges Jude to take action. He visits a lawyer, who advises him to take the infant somewhere he can be safe, and obtains a court order prohibiting Mina from being the child\u2019s  primary caretaker.\n\nWhile Mina is distracted, Jude gives the baby boy to his mother, who takes provisional care of him while Mina is meant to recuperate. Jude and Mina, now at seemingly irreparable odds with each other, visit their child on a frequent basis, and Jude\u2019s mother grows further uncomfortable with Mina\u2019s disturbing physical and mental state. During an unannounced visit, Mina attempts to forcibly take her child home with her, but Jude and his mother prevent this. In a brief struggle for the baby between Mina and Jude, Mina is knocked into a door frame, bruising and splitting her lip. Mina leaves the house in quiet frustration.\n\nThe following night Jude is woken by flashing lights outside of his mother\u2019s house. He and his mother convene downstairs, where a police officer knocks on the door, informing Jude that he has been accused of battery. Mina appears from behind the officer, accompanied by other authorities, and takes their child back to New York City despite Jude and his mother\u2019s desperate pleadings.\n\nMina takes the infant to the boardwalk where she and Jude were married, and the two spend the day quietly observing the ocean. \n\nIn the night Mina wakes upon hearing someone enter the apartment. An unseen person enters the bedroom and stands face-to-face with Mina. The screen cuts to black as a gunshot sounds.\n\nJude is shown running down a street illuminated by police lights. He turns into a police station, urgently inquiring to the residing officers about the whereabouts of his son. The authorities hand Jude the baby. In the station, Jude sobs while holding his child. A police interview is shown revealing that Jude\u2019s mother killed Mina to ensure the safety of her grandson, accepting the punishment she will receive as a result.\n\nIn the final scene, Jude and his son walk along the beach. The child, now healthy and of school age, holds his father\u2019s hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Jude\n* [[Alba Rohrwacher]] as Mina\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Anne\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Dr. Bill\n* [[Natalie Gold]] as Jennifer\n* [[Victor Williams]]\n* [[Victoria Cartagena]] as Monica\n* [[Cristina J.

The couple return home, where Mina expresses a distrust of modern medicine. She decides to employ only [[alternative medicine]], going so far as to visit a psychic who informs Mina that her fetus is an [[Indigo child]]. Trusting her maternal instincts, Jude does not initially intervene with Mina\u2019s self-inflicted undernourishment and shunning of western treatment options.\n\nMina continues to undernourish herself and her unborn child, and when it is time for her to give birth, contractions do not begin due to her malnourishment. As the baby goes into distress, Jude takes Mina to the hospital where a [[c-section]] is performed against her wishes. The baby boy is weak and must begin his life inside an [[neonatal incubator|incubator]]. \n\nSeven months later, Mina has not allowed her son to be taken outside of the apartment. Over a growing obsession with purity and cleanliness, Mina does not allow outsiders to touch her baby without first washing their hands, requires all cell phones be left at the bottom of the entryway stairs, and keeps the infant to a vegan diet. She continues to renounce modern medicine. While Mina is gone, Jude takes the baby to a doctor who informs him that the baby is severely malnourished, and at risk of retarded growth or death. Jude returns home and confronts Mina about her parenting style. The rift between the two grows larger. Mina is horrified when she returns home to find Jude feeding their baby a meat product, and after an argument during which Jude slaps Mina, she agrees to allow Jude to take charge of feeding the baby.\n\nAfter two weeks of following the prescribed diet, the baby has not gained any weight. Jude is suspicious of Mina, who takes the baby away after every meal. Jude discovers that Mina, gaunt and withered herself, has been feeding the baby an [[anti-nutrient]] oil, preventing him from absorbing food. Jude finds excuses throughout each day to take the infant outside and feed him in secret. While visiting, Jude\u2019s mother becomes aware of the situation and urges Jude to take action. He visits a lawyer, who advises him to take the infant somewhere he can be safe, and obtains a court order prohibiting Mina from being the child\u2019s  primary caretaker.\n\nWhile Mina is distracted, Jude gives the baby boy to his mother, who takes provisional care of him while Mina is meant to recuperate. Jude and Mina, now at seemingly irreparable odds with each other, visit their child on a frequent basis, and Jude\u2019s mother grows further uncomfortable with Mina\u2019s disturbing physical and mental state. During an unannounced visit, Mina attempts to forcibly take her child home with her, but Jude and his mother prevent this. In a brief struggle for the baby between Mina and Jude, Mina is knocked into a door frame, bruising and splitting her lip. Mina leaves the house in quiet frustration.\n\nThe following night Jude is woken by flashing lights outside of his mother\u2019s house. He and his mother convene downstairs, where a police officer knocks on the door, informing Jude that he has been accused of battery. Mina appears from behind the officer, accompanied by other authorities, and takes their child back to New York City despite Jude and his mother\u2019s desperate pleadings.\n\nMina takes the infant to the boardwalk where she and Jude were married, and the two spend the day quietly observing the ocean. \n\nIn the night Mina wakes upon hearing someone enter the apartment. An unseen person enters the bedroom and stands face-to-face with Mina. The screen cuts to black as a gunshot sounds.\n\nJude is shown running down a street illuminated by police lights. He turns into a police station, urgently inquiring to the residing officers about the whereabouts of his son. The authorities hand Jude the baby. In the station, Jude sobs while holding his child. A police interview is shown revealing that Jude\u2019s mother killed Mina to ensure the safety of her grandson, accepting the punishment she will receive as a result.\n\nIn the final scene, Jude and his son walk along the beach. The child, now healthy and of school age, holds his father\u2019s hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Jude\n* [[Alba Rohrwacher]] as Mina\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Anne\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Dr. Bill\n* [[Natalie Gold]] as Jennifer\n* [[Victor Williams]]\n* [[Victoria Cartagena]] as Monica\n* [[Cristina J.

It was created by [[Alan Bateman]] and commenced broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to [[Kangaroo Point, New South Wales]], where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called ''Refuge'', but the name was changed to the \"friendlier\" title of ''Home and Away'' once production began. The show premiered with a ninety-minute pilot episode (subsequently in re-runs and on VHS known as ''Home and Away: The Movie''). Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and ''Home and Away'' has become the second longest-running drama series in Australian television. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm.\n\n'Home and Away' follows the lives and loves of the residents in [[Summer Bay]], a fictional seaside town of [[New South Wales]]. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family \u2013 [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) and [[Pippa Ross|Pippa]] ([[Vanessa Downing]]), and their five foster children, [[Frank Morgan (Home and Away)|Frank Morgan]] ([[Alex Papps]]), [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]), [[Lynn Davenport]] (Helena Bozich), [[Steven Matheson]] ([[Adam Willits]]) and [[Sally Fletcher]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) \u2013 who moved from the city into the [[Summer Bay#Summer Bay House|Summer Bay House]], where they assumed the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]). ''Home and Away'' was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, rape, drug and alcohol addiction, drug overdose and attempted suicide. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its restricted time slot. [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] in [[Sydney]]'s [[Northern Beaches]] district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the [[Australian Technology Park]] in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\n''Home and Away'' has been sold to over eighty countries around the world, making it one of Australia's successful media exports. In the UK, it and ''[[Neighbours]]'', another Australian soap opera, are the most popular of the genre that are filmed internationally, with them both airing twice daily on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. It is one of the highest-rating shows on [[RT\u00c9 Television]] in Ireland and [[TVNZ 2]] in New Zealand. In Australia, ''Home and Away'' is the most awarded program at the [[Logie Awards]], with a total of forty-six wins, including [[Logie Award for Best Drama Program|Best Drama Program]]. Some cast members have won several other awards such as the [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television]], [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actor|Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor]], and [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actress|Most Popular Actress]]. In 2015, ''Home and Away'' was inducted into the [[Logie Hall of Fame]].\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Seven Network]] cancelled their soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' on 12 July 1985 due to low ratings, rival network [[Network Ten|Ten]] picked it up and turned it into a success.<ref>[[#refmercado|Mercado 2004]], p. 205.</ref> A couple of years later, Seven's head of drama, [[Alan Bateman]], became desperate to get back into the soap market and began to work out how to launch another soap that was not a copy of ''Neighbours''.<ref name=\"TwoFiveOne\">[[#refmercado|Mercado 2004]], p. 251.</ref> While on a trip to [[Kangaroo Point, New South Wales]] with his family, Bateman began talking to locals who were \"up in arms\" over the construction of a foster home for children from the city.<ref name=\"TwoFiveOne\"/><ref name=\"Rand\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/sunday-magazine/home-and-away-in-la/story-e6frf039-1111118645473|title=Home and Away in LA|last=Rand|first=Hannah|date=25 January 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> Seeing the degree of conflict the \"influx of parentless children on a tight-knit community\" was having, Bateman came away with the idea for a new serial.<ref name=\"Rand\"/> He explained \"Nobody in the community wanted them to move in and I began to wonder how streetwise city kids would adapt to the new lifestyle.

Network executives are currently considering the show's future as pressure is on the Seven Network to make drastic changes to the schedule before 2020. The series will likely be losing its 7pm timeslot in favour of reality TV which has been dominating Australian television more recently. Despite the drop in viewing figures, ''Home and Away'' remains one of the highest-rated drama series' in Australia and is significantly more popular within streaming and catch-up services. One option is to move the series to a later timeslot on the Seven Network, following the reality shows, in order to explore more adult oriented storylines, while another option is to premiere five episodes each Friday on 7Plus and replay over the following week on 7Two.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Kevin|title=SEVEN executives look to TODAY TONIGHT as the future of HOME AND AWAY now in doubt| url=https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2019/1/15/seven-home-away?format=non-amp|website=TV Blackbox|date=5 July 2019|accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the cancellation news, Lynne McGranger claimed that she hadn't heard that the show was being cancelled and commented that \"I'm seeing all this stuff but I honestly have heard nothing. It may be true.... but then again I apparently was definitely leaving the Bay 18 months or so ago.\" It was said that rumours began circulating when TV Blackbox posted the article and stated that the show was to move to a new timeslot and that it performs better on catch-up and demand which was believed to be a misunderstanding when tabloids reported that the show was close to its end.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderton|first1=Joe|title=Home and Away legend Lynne McGranger plays down talk of the soap's axe|\nurl=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/a28306133/home-and-away-lynne-mcgranger-soap-axe-talk/|website=Digital Spy|date=6 July 2019|accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 July 2019, in an article for [[New Idea]], it was confirmed that the rumours were in fact untrue.

(often abbreviated as '''H&A''') is an Australian television [[soap opera]]. It was created by [[Alan Bateman]] and commenced broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to [[Kangaroo Point, New South Wales]], where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called ''Refuge'', but the name was changed to the \"friendlier\" title of ''Home and Away'' once production began. The show premiered with a ninety-minute pilot episode (subsequently in re-runs and on VHS known as '''Home and Away: The Movie'''). Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and ''Home and Away'' has become the second longest-running drama series in Australian television. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm.\n\n'Home and Away' follows the lives and loves of the residents in [[Summer Bay]], a fictional seaside town of [[New South Wales]]. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family \u2013 [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) and [[Pippa Ross|Pippa]] ([[Vanessa Downing]]), and their five foster children, [[Frank Morgan (Home and Away)|Frank Morgan]] ([[Alex Papps]]), [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]), [[Lynn Davenport]] (Helena Bozich), [[Steven Matheson]] ([[Adam Willits]]) and [[Sally Fletcher]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) \u2013 who moved from the city into the [[Summer Bay#Summer Bay House|Summer Bay House]], where they assumed the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]). ''Home and Away'' was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, rape, drug and alcohol addiction, drug overdose and attempted suicide. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its restricted time slot. [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] in [[Sydney]]'s [[Northern Beaches]] district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the [[Australian Technology Park]] in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\n''Home and Away'' has been sold to over eighty countries around the world, making it one of Australia's successful media exports. In the UK, it and ''[[Neighbours]]'', another Australian soap opera, are the most popular of the genre that are filmed internationally, with them both airing twice daily on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. It is one of the highest-rating shows on [[RT\u00c9 Television]] in Ireland and [[TVNZ 2]] in New Zealand. In Australia, ''Home and Away'' is the most awarded program at the [[Logie Awards]], with a total of forty-six wins, including [[Logie Award for Best Drama Program|Best Drama Program]]. Some cast members have won several other awards such as the [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television]], [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actor|Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor]], and [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actress|Most Popular Actress]]. In 2015, ''Home and Away'' was inducted into the [[Logie Hall of Fame]].\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Seven Network]] cancelled their soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' on 12 July 1985 due to low ratings, rival network [[Network Ten|Ten]] picked it up and turned it into a success.<ref>[[#refmercado|Mercado 2004]], p. 205.</ref> A couple of years later, Seven's head of drama, [[Alan Bateman]], became desperate to get back into the soap market and began to work out how to launch another soap that was not a copy of ''Neighbours''.<ref name=\"TwoFiveOne\">[[#refmercado|Mercado 2004]], p. 251.</ref> While on a trip to [[Kangaroo Point, New South Wales]] with his family, Bateman began talking to locals who were \"up in arms\" over the construction of a foster home for children from the city.<ref name=\"TwoFiveOne\"/><ref name=\"Rand\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/sunday-magazine/home-and-away-in-la/story-e6frf039-1111118645473|title=Home and Away in LA|last=Rand|first=Hannah|date=25 January 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> Seeing the degree of conflict the \"influx of parentless children on a tight-knit community\" was having, Bateman came away with the idea for a new serial.<ref name=\"Rand\"/> He explained \"Nobody in the community wanted them to move in and I began to wonder how streetwise city kids would adapt to the new lifestyle.

Network executives are currently considering the show's future as pressure is on the Seven Network to make drastic changes to the schedule before 2020. The series will likely be losing its 7pm timeslot in favour of reality TV which has been dominating Australian television more recently. Despite the drop in viewing figures, ''Home and Away'' remains one of the highest-rated drama series' in Australia and is significantly more popular within streaming and catch-up services. One option is to move the series to a later timeslot on the Seven Network, following the reality shows, in order to explore more adult oriented storylines, while another option is to premiere five episodes each Friday on 7Plus and replay over the following week on 7Two.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Kevin|title=SEVEN executives look to TODAY TONIGHT as the future of HOME AND AWAY now in doubt| url=https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2019/1/15/seven-home-away?format=non-amp|website=TV Blackbox|date=5 July 2019|accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the cancellation news, Lynne McGranger claimed that she hadn't heard that the show was being cancelled and commented that \"I'm seeing all this stuff but I honestly have heard nothing. It may be true.... but then again I apparently was definitely leaving the Bay 18 months or so ago.\" It was said that rumours began circulating when TV Blackbox posted the article and stated that the show was to move to a new timeslot and that it performs better on catch-up and demand which was believed to be a misunderstanding when tabloids reported that the show was close to its end.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderton|first1=Joe|title=Home and Away legend Lynne McGranger plays down talk of the soap's axe|\nurl=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/a28306133/home-and-away-lynne-mcgranger-soap-axe-talk/|website=Digital Spy|date=6 July 2019|accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 July 2019, in an article for [[New Idea]], it was confirmed that the rumours were in fact untrue.

In 2007, the show breached broadcasting rules when they aired a number of episodes featuring [[Martha MacKenzie]] ([[Jodi Gordon]]) involved with [[pole-dancing]] in the G classification, as the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) said that these episodes should have been rated PG as they contained sexual scenes and references.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/home-and-away-too-saucy-for-rating/story-e6frfmyi-1111114569324|title=Home and Away too saucy for rating|publisher=news.com.au|date=4 October 2007|accessdate=22 August 2007}}</ref> Since 2008, every subsequent episode has been broadcast under the PG classification and often continues to exceed the rating. A 2010 episode which featured Martha McKenzie engaging in a sexual scene with [[Liam Murphy]] ([[Axle Whitehead]]) on a kitchen table was deemed \"too raunchy\" by a television watchdog in New Zealand, as the series was aired in a G-rated timeslot at 5:30 pm on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/a277936/ha-too-raunchy-for-nz-television/|title='H&A' too \"raunchy\" for NZ television|last=Davies|first=Rebecca|date=21 September 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> From 2015, ''The Early Years'' episodes (G-rated in original airings) which broadcast on weekday mornings on 7Two have been re-rated PG.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Home and Away characters|List of past Home and Away characters}}\n<!-- Please do not add character tables here - use the existing articles listed above -->\n[[File:Ray Meagher.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Ray Meagher]] ([[Alf Stewart]]) is currently the only remaining original cast member in ''Home and Away''.]]\n\nWhen ''Home and Away'' began in 1988, it initially focused on the Fletcher family \u2013 [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) and his wife [[Pippa Ross|Pippa]] ([[Vanessa Downing]]), and their five foster children, [[Frank Morgan (Home and Away)|Frank Morgan]] ([[Alex Papps]]), [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]), [[Steven Matheson]] ([[Adam Willits]]), [[Lynn Davenport]]&nbsp;(Helena Bozich), and [[Sally Fletcher]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) \u2013 who relocated from the city to live in the seaside town of Summer Bay.<ref name=\"TelevisionAu\"/><ref name=\"25 Years\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/01/25-years-for-home-and-away.html|title=25 years for Home and Away|last=Knox|first=David|website=TV Tonight|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> At the end of the first episode, Tom and Pippa take in their sixth foster child [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]).<ref name=\"TelevisionAu\"/><ref name=\"25 Years\"/> The Fletchers bought the Summer Bay Caravan Park and moved into the Summer Bay House.<ref name=\"Rand\"/> They quickly built strong friendships with the locals, [[Ailsa Stewart]] ([[Judy Nunn]]), [[Alf Stewart]] ([[Ray Meagher]]), [[Donald Fisher (Home and Away)|Donald Fisher]] ([[Norman Coburn]]), and [[Neville McPhee|Neville]] ([[Frank Lloyd (actor)|Frank Lloyd]]) and [[Floss McPhee]] ([[Sheila Kennelly]]).<ref name=\"TelevisionAu\"/><ref name=\"25 Years\"/>\n\nWhile ''Home and Away'' features a mix of young cast members and older, more experienced actors, the show has always had a definite youth focus, with the younger characters dominating much of the storylines.<ref name=\"TelevisionAu\"/> Many of the cast have spent several years on ''Home and Away'', including original cast member Judy Nunn who left the series in 2000 after 12 years playing the co-owner of Summer Bay's diner.
