Hempstead Village is the site of the seventeenth-century \"town spot\" from which English and Dutch settlers developed the Town of Hempstead, the Town of North Hempstead, and ultimately Nassau County.\n\nSeveral of Nassau County's most historically valuable buildings are in the Village of Hempstead, including Town of Hempstead Town Hall (built in 1918), Carman-Irish Hall at 160 Marvin Avenue (built about 1700), St. George's Episcopal Church (319 Front Street, erected 1822), St. George's Rectory (217 Peninsula Boulevard, built 1793), and the United Methodist Church at 40 Washington Street (erected 1855).<ref name=\"Bethany 2018\">{{Cite book|title=Hempstead Village|last=Bethany|first=Reine|date=2018|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|others=Foreword by Don Ryan.|isbn=978-1467128155|location=Charleston, South Carolina|pages=|oclc=1011679636}}</ref> The Carman-Irish Hall is occupied by American Legion Post 390. The church structures have been in continuous use by their congregations since they were built.\n\nChrist's First Presbyterian Church at 353 Fulton Avenue is Nassau County's oldest Presbyterian congregation, and one of the earliest in the United States, having been founded in 1644 by Richard Denton.\n\nJackson Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church, housed at 60 Peninsula Boulevard since the mid-1950s, was established between 1825 and 1840.<ref name=\"Bethany 2018\"/> It is one of the county's oldest African American congregations.\n\nDiversity has long been a characteristic of Hempstead. While it was majority white until the mid-twentieth century, Hempstead had a significant black population from about 1651 onward, in addition to the native peoples still living on Long Island. Starting in the nineteenth century, Hempstead's diversity increased. Irish, Polish, and German immigrants arrived during the second half of the nineteenth century to join the descendants of the original English and Dutch settlers. Military personnel were trained at Camp Mills during 1918 and at Mitchel Field during World War II, and some stayed to raise families, adding other European-descent groups and African Americans. During the first half of the twentieth century, African Americans from the South who sought opportunities in the North established homes and businesses in Hempstead. Nassau County's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established in Hempstead in 1932. A major case against de facto segregation in Hempstead was taken to the New York State Supreme Court in 1949 by Thurgood Marshall. From the 1950s forward, the village's African American population has increased, and so have Mexican, Central American, and South American groups, as well as Caribbean immigrants, Middle Easterners, and Asians, especially Indians and South Asians. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Hofstra University]] (founded 1934) is located in Hempstead.\n\n== History ==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:TownOfHempsteadHall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Town of Hempstead]]'s old Town Hall located in The Village of Hempstead on the corner of Front Street and Washington Street.

In 1968, a new Town Hall with entrance on Washington Street instead of Front Street was attached to the historic building, and so was the Nathan H.L. Bennett Pavilion, whose main entrance faces toward Main Street across the Town Hall parking lot. The 1918 building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in May 2018.<ref>Costello, Alex. \"Hempstead Town Hall Added to Registry of Historic Places.\" ''Long Island Patch'', May 14, 2018, https://patch.com/new-york/gardencity/hempstead-town-hall-added-registry-historic-places</ref>]]\nThe land on which the Village of Hempstead stands was under Dutch control from the early 1620s. The Dutch West India Company established, first a trading post in 1613, and then the community of New Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan. Dutch colonies were founded in what is now New Jersey as well as the western half of Long Island. Attracting a sufficient quantity of Dutch settlers to colonize the land, however, proved difficult.<ref>Naylor, Natalie A., editor. The Roots and Heritage of Hempstead Town. Interlaken, NY: Heart of the Lakes Publishing, 1994. p. 15.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, European traders from France, Spain, Holland, and England set up trading posts along the Atlantic Coast; Native Americans had been encountering Europeans since Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into New York Harbor on April 17, 1524. Starting with the Pilgrims in 1620, English citizens founded the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut. A Presbyterian minister named Richard Denton came from Yorkshire, England, to join the Massachusetts Bay colony. He then went to Connecticut and helped establish both Wethersfield and Stamford.\n\nThese colonies were threatened by wars among the Pequots, Narragansetts, and Mohegans. The Pequots had for decades forcibly exerted control over much of the area that became New England, subjugating the Mohegans and many other Algonquian-speaking groups, such as the Narragansett. The Pequots controlled the wampum and fur trades with the Europeans. Initially the Pequots lived peacefully with the Puritans and other English colonists of New England, but as English communities grew, the Pequots felt pressured by loss of territory. They began to trade exclusively with the Dutch, who were centered in New Amsterdam. Native groups resentful of Pequot control (mainly Mohegan and Narragansett) allied with the English. War broke out, culminating in the ugly [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pequot-War Pequot War] of 1636-1637, which broke the dominance of the Pequots.<ref name=\"McBride, Kevin 2019\">McBride, Kevin. \"Pequot War.\" Encyclopaedia Britannica, updated April 9, 2019.</ref>\n\nRelations between Dutch and Indians in western Long Island, and between English and Indians on eastern Long Island, while never truly equal, were more peaceful than in New England. Incidents of violence and misunderstanding did occur during European encounters with the Native Americans along the Hudson River after Henry Hudson reached Manhattan in 1609. However, the native groups had something that the Europeans badly wanted (furs) and the native groups willingly traded furs for the brightly colored European coats and other clothing, as well as for European-style beads, firearms, metal tools, and at times alcohol. The relations between the foreigners and the natives therefore continued to develop.<ref>Strong, John. The Algonquian Peoples of Long Island from Earliest Times to 1700. Interlaken, NY: Empire State Books, 1997, pp. 144-150.</ref> The Pequot defeat in 1636-1637 meant Long Island Native Americans were no longer subject to Pequot dominance, and were free to establish their own complex dealings with the Europeans.<ref>Strong, John.

Interlaken, NY: Empire State Books, 1997, pp. 151-161.</ref>\n\nThe Dutch needed to populate Long Island or lose control of the territory. They invited New England colonists to found new settlements on Long Island, as long as the English settlers agreed to Dutch sovereignty.<ref>Naylor, Natalie A., editor. ''The Roots and Heritage of Hempstead Town''. Interlaken, NY: Heart of the Lakes Publishing, 1994. pp. 15-16.</ref> Possibly the English had visited Long Island during the late 1630s and early 1640s.<ref name=\"McBride, Kevin 2019\"/> A dreadful series of raids on Native American groups mainly in Staten Island and Manhattan, provoked and sustained by then-Dutch Governor Willem Kieft during 1640-1645, evoked retaliatory action from the Native groups, and led ultimately to the deaths of 1,000+ Native Americans and a few dozen white settlers (mostly Hutch). This unfortunate series of battles was known as Kieft's War, and was finally ended with a treaty signed in Manhattan in 1645.<ref>Strong, John. The Algonquian Peoples of Long Island from Earliest Times to 1700. Interlaken, NY: Empire State Books, 1997, p. 33.</ref> These perturbances could have deterred further European settlements in western Long Island. However, at a lull in Kieft's War, a Long Island Native leader known as Sachem Pennawitz represented Long Island's Native groups in a peace agreement with the Dutch on March 4, 1643.<ref>Smits, Edward J. \"New From Lange Eylandt: The 1640s and 1650s,\" in Natalie A.

Denton's followers, Robert Fordham and John Carman, crossed [[Long Island Sound]] by rowboat to negotiate with the local inhabitants (Indians) for a tract of land upon which to establish a new community or \"town spot\". Representatives of the [[Marsapeague]] (Massapequa), [[Mericock]] (Merrick), [[Matinecock]] and [[Rekowake]] (Rockaway) tribes met with the two men at a site slightly west of the current Denton Green in Hempstead Village. Tackapousha, who was the [[sachem]] (chief spokesman) of the Marsapeague, was the acknowledged spokesman for conducting the transaction.<ref name=\"History of Hempstead Village\">{{cite web|url=http://longislandgenealogy.com/hempstead.html|title=History of Hempstead Village|publisher=Long Island Genealogy (James.

The settling of Hempstead marked the beginnings of the oldest English settlement in what is now Nassau County. Subsequent trips across the Sound brought more settlers who prepared a fort here for their mutual protection. These original Hempstead settlers were [[Puritan]]s in search of a place where they could more freely express their particular brand of [[Protestantism]]. They established a Presbyterian church that is the oldest continually active Presbyterian congregation in the nation.<ref name=\"History of Hempstead Village\"/> In 1843, Benjamin F. Thompson wrote and published a history of the village, and an account of contemporary Hempstead Village. Thompson reported that there were 200 dwellings, and 1,400 residents; that the village was connected to [[New York City]] by a [[Hempstead Turnpike|Turnpike]] and a railroad; that it had dry soil, excellent water, and pure air; and that it was the principal place of mercantile, and mechanical business, in the county. The village of Hempstead was incorporated on May 6, 1853, becoming the first community in [[Queens|Queens County]] (Nassau County did not exist as a separate county until 1899) to do so.<ref name=\"Village\"/>\n\nRegarding the origin of the name \"Hempstead\", Hempstead founder John Carman was born in 1606 in [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], on ancestral land recorded in the 2nd historic census of England (under [[Edward the First]]), the Rotuli Hundredorum (Hundred Rolls) AD 1273 as being owned by his direct ancestor Henry Carman. These same properties were on record continuously as being owned by Henry's descendants, through John Carman of 1606. John's wife Florence and her father, Rev. Robert Fordham, were from the county of [[Surrey]], England.<ref name=\"History of Hempstead Village\"/> Another theory regarding the origin of the name 'Hempstead' is that it is derived from the Dutch town of '[[Heemstede]]' in the Netherlands, as this was an area from which many Dutch settlers of New Netherland originated. Several of Hempstead's original fifty patentees had Dutch [[surname]]s. In 1664, the new settlement adopted the [[The Duke's Laws|Duke's Laws]], an austere set of laws that became the basis upon which the laws of many colonies were to be founded. For a time, Hempstead became known as \"Old Blue,\" as a result of the \"[[Blue law|Blue Laws]]\".<ref name=\"Village\"/>\n\n===Rise===\n[[File:stgeorgeold.jpg|right|thumb|St. George's Church circa 1734]]\nAs the years passed, the population of Hempstead increased, as did its importance and prestige. Between 1703 and 1705, the newly formed [[St. George's Episcopal Church (Hempstead)|St. George's Church]], which would not have been called \"Episcopal\" then, but was under the established Church of England, received a silver communion service from [[England]]'s [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref name=\"Village\"/>  Right after he became President, George Washington made a tour of Long Island, stopping overnight at Sammis Tavern here (Nehemiah Sammis's Inn established between 1660 and 1680<ref>Schultz, Bernice Marshall, 1937.

Hempstead can boast of its share of celebrities. [[Peter Cooper]], inventor and politician, lived with his brother in Hempstead until he married Sarah Bedell of Hempstead on Dec. 18, 1813, and settled there 1814-1818.<ref>Nevins, Allan. 1935.

Before Nat Hicks, baseball catchers would stand approximately 25 feet behind the batter, catching the pitched baseball on a bounce, since there were no gloves or protective gear. Pitchers would not throw curveballs because they would likely be wild pitches. In 1872 while playing for a Brooklyn team, Hicks stood directly behind the batter, catching the pitched baseball in flight instead of on a bounce.  This allowed his teammate, pitcher Cummings, to throw curveballs. Hicks was badly injured often but he changed baseball fundamentally. This repositing of catcher by Hicks facilitated pictures throwing breaking balls, throwing over-hand instead of underhand, made the game faster paced, and necessitated the need for new inventions such as baseball gloves, catchers protective gear, and the facemask.<ref>{{cite web | website=Society for Baseball Research | url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/aa4bd0e2 | accessdate=December 28, 2019 | title=Nat Hicks}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Peter |title=Baseball Fever: Early Baseball in Michigan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ry-ioPx2V4kC&pg=PA322&lpg=PA322&dq=nat+hicks+baseball#v=onepage&q=nat%20hicks%20baseball&f=false |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=322 |isbn=0-472-09826-8|year=2003 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Hempstead became increasingly important as a trading center for [[Long Island]]. In 1853 it became the first self-governing incorporated village. Many prominent families such as the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] and the [[August Belmont|Belmonts]] built homes here, making Hempstead a center of Long Island society. Hempstead merchants established routes out to outlying farms and served as a distribution point for many firms. Wagons would leave Hempstead loaded with tobacco, candy, and cigarettes and return in a week to restock. Bakeries covered routes from [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin]] to [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]] daily. Butchers ran routes to [[Seaford, New York|Seaford]], [[Elmont, New York|Elmont]], [[Valley Stream, New York|Valley Stream]], [[Wantagh, New York|Wantagh]], [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]], [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center|Creedmoor]], [[East Rockaway, New York|East Rockaway]] and [[Christian Hook, New York|Christian Hook]]. Drugs, medicines, perfumes, extracts, aprons, children's coats and dresses and men's clothes were peddled about the country by Hempstead merchants. People came from all sections of Queens to purchase stoves, and there were few places outside Hempstead where stoves could be purchased. Hempstead was the shopping center for Nassau County and the eastern portion of Queens, those settlements east of Jamaica before 1900 when Nassau County was established, following the creation of the [[City of Greater New York]] in 1898. Hempstead has historically been the center of commercial activity for the eastern counties of Long Island. In Nassau County, all major county roads emanate from this village. It is indeed the \"Hub\" of Nassau County. During the 18th and 19th centuries, all stage coaches en route to [[Suffolk County, New York|eastern Long Island]] from Brooklyn passed through Hempstead. Today, seventeen bus routes and three interstate buses leave from the village every day. In addition, the [[Hempstead Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] has its terminal here. At one time, there were three railroad companies with terminals within the village.<ref>\"The Creation of Nassau County\"- Published 1960, by the Nassau County Historical Museum</ref>\n\nIn March 1898, Camp Black was formed on the [[Hempstead Plains]] (roughly the shared location of Hempstead and [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]]), in support of the impending [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Camp Black was bounded on the north by [[Old Country Road]], on the west by Clinton Road, and on the south by the [[Central Branch (Long Island Rail Road)|Central Line]] rail. Camp Black was opened on April 29, 1898 as a training facility and a point of embarkation for troops.<ref name=\"LIgenealogy-CampBlack\">{{cite web |url=http://longislandgenealogy.com/CampBlack/CampBlack.html |title=Camp Black \u2013 Garden City, Hemstead Plains 1898 |publisher=Long Island Genealogy |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Lindbergh|Charles A.

Hempstead, with its central location, became the marketplace for the outlying [[rural]] farming communities. It was a natural progression, as the surrounding areas developed from small farms into today's [[suburbia]], that Hempstead Village would remain as the marketplace. [[Chain store|Chain]] [[department stores]] such as [[Arnold Constable & Company|Arnold Constable]] and [[Abraham & Straus]] called Hempstead home for many years. Hempstead's Abraham & Straus was the largest grossing suburban department store in the country during the late 1960s. Hempstead was Nassau's retail center during the 1940s through the 1960s. The advent of regional [[shopping mall]]s such as the one at nearby [[Roosevelt Field Mall|Roosevelt Field]], the demise of nearby [[Mitchel Air Force Base]] in 1961 as well as the changing [[demographics]] put the retail trade in the village into a downward spiral that it was unable to recover from during the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s.

There are more government employees from all levels of government in the village than there are in the county seat in [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]].

Specifically, two large tracts of retail property have recently undergone redevelopment.  The former {{convert|8.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} Times Squares Stores (or TSS) property on [[Peninsula Boulevard]] and Franklin Street has been redeveloped as Hempstead Village Commons, a {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail center including [[Pep Boys]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]]. The former Abraham & Straus department store on {{convert|17|acre|m2}} has recently undergone demolition and been replaced by a large retail development consisting of [[Home Depot]], [[Old Navy]], [[Stop & Shop]] and many other smaller establishments. A considerable infusion of state and federal funding as well as private investment have enabled the replacement of blighted storefronts, complete commercial building rehabilitations and the development of affordable housing for the local population. The replacement of the 1913 [[Long Island Rail Road]] [[Hempstead (LIRR station)|Hempstead Terminal]] with a modern facility was completed in 2002<ref name=\"antonnews.com\">{{cite news | title = LIRR Hempstead Station Hub Reconstruction Work Marked by Dedication Ceremony | work = Three Village Times | date = 1999-03-19 | url = http://www.antonnews.com/threevillagetimes/1999/03/19/news/railroad.html | accessdate = 2019-01-30 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080906222113/http://www.antonnews.com/threevillagetimes/1999/03/19/news/railroad.html | archivedate = 2008-09-06 }}</ref> and a four-story, 112 unit building for senior housing, with retail on the ground level was completed at Main and West Columbia Streets in January 1998. Thirty two units of affordable townhouses known as Patterson Mews at Henry Street and Baldwin Road was completed and fully occupied in 1997.\n\nIn 1989, Hempstead residents elected [[James Garner (politician)|James A. Garner]] ([[United States Republican Party|R]]) as their mayor. He was the first Black or African-American mayor ever elected to office in New York state and he served for four consecutive terms.  Subsequently, Wayne Hall, a former Village of Hempstead trustee who is also African American, served as mayor for three terms, from 2005 to 2017.\n\nThe first African-American male judge, Lance Clarke, was elected in 2001. Cynthia Diaz-Wilson was the first female justice in the Village of Hempstead and first African American village justice in the state of New York.\n\nIn recent years, there has been concern regarding ongoing gang activity in certain neighborhoods, notably the \"Heights\". Hempstead was also one of the first Long Island communities that had to deal with the [[Salvadoran]] gang, [[Ms 13|MS-13]] or \"La Mara Salvatrucha\". The continual intra-violence this gang has exhibited has led to the formation of their arch-rivals, \"SWP\" or \"Salvadorans with Pride\". These issues have contributed to Hempstead's high crime rate as compared to other communities in the area.\n\n==Today==\n\nHempstead has developed into the most populous village in the state of New York, with a population in excess of 50,000 people. It is also the seat of government for the town of Hempstead, the largest [[minor civil division]] in the nation with over seven hundred thousand people. Hempstead is just as urban (at least with regard to population density and activity) as any major city. In stark contrast to the surrounding villages in the town and county, it is more densely populated than many American cities with exception to New York City, [[Long Beach, New York]]; [[Mount Vernon, New York]]; [[Boston]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; [[San Francisco, California]]; [[Santa Ana, California]]; and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[Paterson, New Jersey]].\n\nHempstead consists of several areas or [[neighborhood]]s that are distinct in character.  Some enclaves have a reputation of being the source of crime, some are known to be populated by indigent residents, others consist of middle income residents and homeowners, while others boast stately homes with relatively little incidence of criminal activity. The area has a mixture of homes and apartment complexes throughout the area. Originally, there were two known sides of town, \"The Heights\" (Hempstead Heights) and \"The Hills\" (Hempstead Hills). Hempstead Heights is the area east of Clinton St and west of Westbury Blvd. Over the years, several new regions, or \"turfs\" have informally been established, including \"Terrace\" (also known as \"TA\" or Terrace Ave.), \"Parkside\", \"Trackside\" and \"Midway\",\"D-Block\".\n\nThere are over fifty religious institutions located in the village of Hempstead. They include a vast range of denominations, including, [[Roman Catholic]], (Eastern Catholic) [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Greek Orthodox|Orthodox]], [[Methodist]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Baptist]], [[Lutheran]] and other [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Sikh]] [[Gurudwara]], a [[Korea]]n temple, a [[Judaism|Hebrew Congregation]] and a host of smaller congregations.<ref name=\"About the Village\"/>{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Government==\nThe Hempstead Village government is currently headed by mayor Don Ryan, who defeated three-term mayor Wayne Hall in the March 2017 election.<ref>\"[http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/hempstead-village-gets-new-mayor-as-don-ryan-defeats-wayne-hall-1.13300256 Hempstead Village gets new mayor as Don Ryan defeats Wayne Hall]\" (preview only; subscription required).

Hempstead Village is the site of the seventeenth-century \"town spot\" from which English and Dutch settlers developed the Town of Hempstead, the Town of North Hempstead, and ultimately Nassau County.\n\nSeveral of Nassau County's most historically valuable buildings are in the Village of Hempstead, including Town of Hempstead Town Hall (built in 1918), Carman-Irish Hall at 160 Marvin Avenue (built about 1700), St. George's Episcopal Church (319 Front Street, erected 1822), St. George's Rectory (217 Peninsula Boulevard, built 1793), and the United Methodist Church at 40 Washington Street (erected 1855).<ref name=\"Bethany 2018\">{{Cite book|title=Hempstead Village|last=Bethany|first=Reine|date=2018|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|others=Foreword by Don Ryan.|isbn=978-1467128155|location=Charleston, South Carolina|pages=|oclc=1011679636}}</ref> The Carman-Irish Hall is occupied by American Legion Post 390. The church structures have been in continuous use by their congregations since they were built.\n\nChrist's First Presbyterian Church at 353 Fulton Avenue is Nassau County's oldest Presbyterian congregation, and one of the earliest in the United States, having been founded in 1644 by Richard Denton.\n\nJackson Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church, housed at 60 Peninsula Boulevard since the mid-1950s, was established between 1825 and 1840.<ref name=\"Bethany 2018\"/> It is one of the county's oldest African American congregations.\n\nDiversity has long been a characteristic of Hempstead. While it was majority white until the mid-twentieth century, Hempstead had a significant black population from about 1651 onward, in addition to the native peoples still living on Long Island. Starting in the nineteenth century, Hempstead's diversity increased. Irish, Polish, and German immigrants arrived during the second half of the nineteenth century to join the descendants of the original English and Dutch settlers. Military personnel were trained at Camp Mills during 1918 and at Mitchel Field during World War II, and some stayed to raise families, adding other European-descent groups and African Americans. During the first half of the twentieth century, African Americans from the South who sought opportunities in the North established homes and businesses in Hempstead. Nassau County's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established in Hempstead in 1932. A major case against de facto segregation in Hempstead was taken to the New York State Supreme Court in 1949 by Thurgood Marshall. From the 1950s forward, the village's African American population has increased, and so have Mexican, Central American, and South American groups, as well as Caribbean immigrants, Middle Easterners, and Asians, especially Indians and South Asians. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Hofstra University]] (founded 1934) is located in Hempstead.\n\n== History ==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:TownOfHempsteadHall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Town of Hempstead]]'s old Town Hall located in The Village of Hempstead on the corner of Front Street and Washington Street.

The Dutch West India Company established, first a trading post in 1613, and then the community of New Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan. Dutch colonies were founded in what is now New Jersey as well as the western half of Long Island. Attracting a sufficient quantity of Dutch settlers to colonize the land, however, proved difficult.<ref>Naylor, Natalie A., editor. The Roots and Heritage of Hempstead Town. Interlaken, NY: Heart of the Lakes Publishing, 1994. p. 15.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, European traders from France, Spain, Holland, and England set up trading posts along the Atlantic Coast; Native Americans had been encountering Europeans since Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into New York Harbor on April 17, 1524. Starting with the Pilgrims in 1620, English citizens founded the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut. A Presbyterian minister named Richard Denton came from Yorkshire, England, to join the Massachusetts Bay colony. He then went to Connecticut and helped establish both Wethersfield and Stamford.\n\nThese colonies were threatened by wars among the Pequots, Narragansetts, and Mohegans. The Pequots had for decades forcibly exerted control over much of the area that became New England, subjugating the Mohegans and many other Algonquian-speaking groups, such as the Narragansett. The Pequots controlled the wampum and fur trades with the Europeans. Initially the Pequots lived peacefully with the Puritans and other English colonists of New England, but as English communities grew, the Pequots felt pressured by loss of territory. They began to trade exclusively with the Dutch, who were centered in New Amsterdam. Native groups resentful of Pequot control (mainly Mohegan and Narragansett) allied with the English. War broke out, culminating in the ugly [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pequot-War Pequot War] of 1636-1637, which broke the dominance of the Pequots.<ref name=\"McBride, Kevin 2019\">McBride, Kevin. \"Pequot War.\" Encyclopaedia Britannica, updated April 9, 2019.</ref>\n\nRelations between Dutch and Indians in western Long Island, and between English and Indians on eastern Long Island, while never truly equal, were more peaceful than in New England. Incidents of violence and misunderstanding did occur during European encounters with the Native Americans along the Hudson River after Henry Hudson reached Manhattan in 1609. However, the native groups had something that the Europeans badly wanted (furs) and the native groups willingly traded furs for the brightly colored European coats and other clothing, as well as for European-style beads, firearms, metal tools, and at times alcohol. The relations between the foreigners and the natives therefore continued to develop.<ref>Strong, John. The Algonquian Peoples of Long Island from Earliest Times to 1700.

They invited New England colonists to found new settlements on Long Island, as long as the English settlers agreed to Dutch sovereignty.<ref>Naylor, Natalie A., editor.

This unfortunate series of battles was known as Kieft's War, and was finally ended with a treaty signed in Manhattan in 1645.<ref>Strong, John.

Denton's followers, Robert Fordham and John Carman, crossed [[Long Island Sound]] by rowboat to negotiate with the local inhabitants (Indians) for a tract of land upon which to establish a new community or \"town spot\". Representatives of the [[Marsapeague]] (Massapequa), [[Mericock]] (Merrick), [[Matinecock]] and [[Rekowake]] (Rockaway) tribes met with the two men at a site slightly west of the current Denton Green in Hempstead Village.

The settling of Hempstead marked the beginnings of the oldest English settlement in what is now Nassau County. Subsequent trips across the Sound brought more settlers who prepared a fort here for their mutual protection. These original Hempstead settlers were [[Puritan]]s in search of a place where they could more freely express their particular brand of [[Protestantism]]. They established a Presbyterian church that is the oldest continually active Presbyterian congregation in the nation.<ref name=\"History of Hempstead Village\"/> In 1843, Benjamin F. Thompson wrote and published a history of the village, and an account of contemporary Hempstead Village. Thompson reported that there were 200 dwellings, and 1,400 residents; that the village was connected to [[New York City]] by a [[Hempstead Turnpike|Turnpike]] and a railroad; that it had dry soil, excellent water, and pure air; and that it was the principal place of mercantile, and mechanical business, in the county. The village of Hempstead was incorporated on May 6, 1853, becoming the first community in [[Queens|Queens County]] (Nassau County did not exist as a separate county until 1899) to do so.<ref name=\"Village\"/>\n\nRegarding the origin of the name \"Hempstead\", Hempstead founder John Carman was born in 1606 in [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], on ancestral land recorded in the 2nd historic census of England (under [[Edward the First]]), the Rotuli Hundredorum (Hundred Rolls) AD 1273 as being owned by his direct ancestor Henry Carman. These same properties were on record continuously as being owned by Henry's descendants, through John Carman of 1606. John's wife Florence and her father, Rev. Robert Fordham, were from the county of [[Surrey]], England.<ref name=\"History of Hempstead Village\"/> Another theory regarding the origin of the name 'Hempstead' is that it is derived from the Dutch town of '[[Heemstede]]' in the Netherlands, as this was an area from which many Dutch settlers of New Netherland originated. Several of Hempstead's original fifty patentees had Dutch [[surname]]s. In 1664, the new settlement adopted the [[The Duke's Laws|Duke's Laws]], an austere set of laws that became the basis upon which the laws of many colonies were to be founded. For a time, Hempstead became known as \"Old Blue,\" as a result of the \"[[Blue law|Blue Laws]]\".<ref name=\"Village\"/>\n\n===Rise===\n[[File:stgeorgeold.jpg|right|thumb|St. George's Church circa 1734]]\nAs the years passed, the population of Hempstead increased, as did its importance and prestige. Between 1703 and 1705, the newly formed [[St. George's Episcopal Church (Hempstead)|St. George's Church]], which would not have been called \"Episcopal\" then, but was under the established Church of England, received a silver communion service from [[England]]'s [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref name=\"Village\"/>  Right after he became President, George Washington made a tour of Long Island, stopping overnight at Sammis Tavern here (Nehemiah Sammis's Inn established between 1660 and 1680<ref>Schultz, Bernice Marshall, 1937.

Hempstead can boast of its share of celebrities. [[Peter Cooper]], inventor and politician, lived with his brother in Hempstead until he married Sarah Bedell of Hempstead on Dec. 18, 1813, and settled there 1814-1818.<ref>Nevins, Allan. 1935.

Before Nat Hicks, baseball catchers would stand approximately 25 feet behind the batter, catching the pitched baseball on a bounce, since there were no gloves or protective gear. Pitchers would not throw curveballs because they would likely be wild pitches. In 1872 while playing for a Brooklyn team, Hicks stood directly behind the batter, catching the pitched baseball in flight instead of on a bounce.  This allowed his teammate, pitcher Cummings, to throw curveballs. Hicks was badly injured often but he changed baseball fundamentally. This repositing of catcher by Hicks facilitated pictures throwing breaking balls, throwing over-hand instead of underhand, made the game faster paced, and necessitated the need for new inventions such as baseball gloves, catchers protective gear, and the facemask.<ref>{{cite web | website=Society for Baseball Research | url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/aa4bd0e2 | accessdate=December 28, 2019 | title=Nat Hicks}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Peter |title=Baseball Fever: Early Baseball in Michigan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ry-ioPx2V4kC&pg=PA322&lpg=PA322&dq=nat+hicks+baseball#v=onepage&q=nat%20hicks%20baseball&f=false |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=322 |isbn=0-472-09826-8|year=2003 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Hempstead became increasingly important as a trading center for [[Long Island]]. In 1853 it became the first self-governing incorporated village. Many prominent families such as the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] and the [[August Belmont|Belmonts]] built homes here, making Hempstead a center of Long Island society. Hempstead merchants established routes out to outlying farms and served as a distribution point for many firms. Wagons would leave Hempstead loaded with tobacco, candy, and cigarettes and return in a week to restock. Bakeries covered routes from [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin]] to [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]] daily. Butchers ran routes to [[Seaford, New York|Seaford]], [[Elmont, New York|Elmont]], [[Valley Stream, New York|Valley Stream]], [[Wantagh, New York|Wantagh]], [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]], [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center|Creedmoor]], [[East Rockaway, New York|East Rockaway]] and [[Christian Hook, New York|Christian Hook]]. Drugs, medicines, perfumes, extracts, aprons, children's coats and dresses and men's clothes were peddled about the country by Hempstead merchants. People came from all sections of Queens to purchase stoves, and there were few places outside Hempstead where stoves could be purchased. Hempstead was the shopping center for Nassau County and the eastern portion of Queens, those settlements east of Jamaica before 1900 when Nassau County was established, following the creation of the [[City of Greater New York]] in 1898. Hempstead has historically been the center of commercial activity for the eastern counties of Long Island. In Nassau County, all major county roads emanate from this village. It is indeed the \"Hub\" of Nassau County. During the 18th and 19th centuries, all stage coaches en route to [[Suffolk County, New York|eastern Long Island]] from Brooklyn passed through Hempstead. Today, seventeen bus routes and three interstate buses leave from the village every day. In addition, the [[Hempstead Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] has its terminal here. At one time, there were three railroad companies with terminals within the village.<ref>\"The Creation of Nassau County\"- Published 1960, by the Nassau County Historical Museum</ref>\n\nIn March 1898, Camp Black was formed on the [[Hempstead Plains]] (roughly the shared location of Hempstead and [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]]), in support of the impending [[Spanish\u2013American War]].

Hempstead, with its central location, became the marketplace for the outlying [[rural]] farming communities. It was a natural progression, as the surrounding areas developed from small farms into today's [[suburbia]], that Hempstead Village would remain as the marketplace. [[Chain store|Chain]] [[department stores]] such as [[Arnold Constable & Company|Arnold Constable]] and [[Abraham & Straus]] called Hempstead home for many years. Hempstead's Abraham & Straus was the largest grossing suburban department store in the country during the late 1960s. Hempstead was Nassau's retail center during the 1940s through the 1960s. The advent of regional [[shopping mall]]s such as the one at nearby [[Roosevelt Field Mall|Roosevelt Field]], the demise of nearby [[Mitchel Air Force Base]] in 1961 as well as the changing [[demographics]] put the retail trade in the village into a downward spiral that it was unable to recover from during the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s.

There are more government employees from all levels of government in the village than there are in the county seat in [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]]. According to James York, the municipal historian, writing in 1998, the population during the day might rise to nearly 200,000, from a normal census of 50,000.<ref name=\"History of Hempstead Village\" /> Retailers' interest in the village was rekindled, due to the aggressive revitalization efforts of former Mayor James Garner, who served from 1989 to 2005, and former Community Development Agency Commissioner, Glen Spiritis, who served under Garner's administration. Specifically, two large tracts of retail property have recently undergone redevelopment.  The former {{convert|8.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} Times Squares Stores (or TSS) property on [[Peninsula Boulevard]] and Franklin Street has been redeveloped as Hempstead Village Commons, a {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail center including [[Pep Boys]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]]. The former Abraham & Straus department store on {{convert|17|acre|m2}} has recently undergone demolition and been replaced by a large retail development consisting of [[Home Depot]], [[Old Navy]], [[Stop & Shop]] and many other smaller establishments.

Garner]] ([[United States Republican Party|R]]) as their mayor. He was the first Black or African-American mayor ever elected to office in New York state and he served for four consecutive terms.  Subsequently, Wayne Hall, a former Village of Hempstead trustee who is also African American, served as mayor for three terms, from 2005 to 2017.\n\nThe first African-American male judge, Lance Clarke, was elected in 2001. Cynthia Diaz-Wilson was the first female justice in the Village of Hempstead and first African American village justice in the state of New York.\n\nIn recent years, there has been concern regarding ongoing gang activity in certain neighborhoods, notably the \"Heights\". Hempstead was also one of the first Long Island communities that had to deal with the [[Salvadoran]] gang, [[Ms 13|MS-13]] or \"La Mara Salvatrucha\". The continual intra-violence this gang has exhibited has led to the formation of their arch-rivals, \"SWP\" or \"Salvadorans with Pride\". These issues have contributed to Hempstead's high crime rate as compared to other communities in the area.\n\n==Today==\n\nHempstead has developed into the most populous village in the state of New York, with a population in excess of 50,000 people. It is also the seat of government for the town of Hempstead, the largest [[minor civil division]] in the nation with over seven hundred thousand people. Hempstead is just as urban (at least with regard to population density and activity) as any major city. In stark contrast to the surrounding villages in the town and county, it is more densely populated than many American cities with exception to New York City, [[Long Beach, New York]]; [[Mount Vernon, New York]]; [[Boston]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; [[San Francisco, California]]; [[Santa Ana, California]]; and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[Paterson, New Jersey]].\n\nHempstead consists of several areas or [[neighborhood]]s that are distinct in character.  Some enclaves have a reputation of being the source of crime, some are known to be populated by indigent residents, others consist of middle income residents and homeowners, while others boast stately homes with relatively little incidence of criminal activity. The area has a mixture of homes and apartment complexes throughout the area. Originally, there were two known sides of town, \"The Heights\" (Hempstead Heights) and \"The Hills\" (Hempstead Hills). Hempstead Heights is the area east of Clinton St and west of Westbury Blvd. Over the years, several new regions, or \"turfs\" have informally been established, including \"Terrace\" (also known as \"TA\" or Terrace Ave.), \"Parkside\", \"Trackside\" and \"Midway\",\"D-Block\".\n\nThere are over fifty religious institutions located in the village of Hempstead.

The 250th overall episode, it was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The episode premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 8, 2014. The episode explores the culture of [[transgender]] individuals and [[gender identity]].\n\n==Plot==\nGetting tired of the stalls in the boys' room being occupied, [[Eric Cartman]] puts a bow on his hat and claims to be \"[[transgender|transginger]]\" in order to use the girls' toilets at school. [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Principal Victoria|Principal Victoria]] is unimpressed, but [[Mr. Garrison]] advises her to give in to avoid the scandal Cartman is almost certain to cause. The girls however are disgusted at Cartman's presence in their toilets, so the school compromises by installing a very fancy transgender toilet in the janitor's room.\n\nMeanwhile, following the previous episode \"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\" in which [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] appeared to impersonate [[Lorde]] for the children's party, it is now revealed that Randy actually is Lorde, who does not otherwise exist. Randy is struggling to keep this secret from both his wife [[Sharon Marsh (South Park)|Sharon]], and from a suspicious [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine]] reporter named Brandon Carlile.\n\nTo get back at Cartman for his actions, [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] uses Cartman's private bathroom by claiming to be transgender herself, using the name \"Wendyl\". Cartman is furious at losing his private room. After angrily confronting Principal Victoria, Cartman takes his anger out on Wendy's boyfriend Stan by saying dating her makes him [[gay]]. Stan, now confused, attempts to discuss gender identity with his father, but Randy misunderstands and instead reveals to Stan that he actually is Lorde. He explains that he started using the women's bathroom at work out of convenience, pretending to be a woman, but eventually found the bathroom to be conducive to creating music. He even shows Stan how he uses home studio software to make himself sound like a girl on a song called \"Feeling Good on a Wednesday\". This leaves Stan even more confused. At the Geological Survey, Randy/Lorde's boss proposes a separate bathroom to appease the other women at the office; however, Randy/Lorde says the bathroom is critical for his/her musical creations.\n\n''[[E! News]]'' reports that Lorde is abandoning music and ''Spin'' will reveal the singer's secret. Cartman teases Stan about his gender confusion issues, coining the insult \"cissy\", based on the term \"[[cisgender]]\". Sharon comforts Randy and indirectly encourages him to continue to express himself as Lorde. Randy completes another, more personal song called \"Push\".

The 250th overall episode, it was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The episode premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 8, 2014. The episode explores the culture of [[transgender]] individuals and [[gender identity]].\n\n==Plot==\nGetting tired of the stalls in the boys' room being occupied, [[Eric Cartman]] puts a bow on his hat and claims to be \"[[transgender|transginger]]\" in order to use the girls' toilets at school. [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Principal Victoria|Principal Victoria]] is unimpressed, but [[Mr. Garrison]] advises her to give in to avoid the scandal Cartman is almost certain to cause. The girls however are disgusted at Cartman's presence in their toilets, so the school compromises by installing a very fancy transgender toilet in the janitor's room.\n\nMeanwhile, following the previous episode \"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\" in which [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] appeared to impersonate [[Lorde]] for the children's party, it is now revealed that Randy actually is Lorde, who does not otherwise exist. Randy is struggling to keep this secret from both his wife [[Sharon Marsh (South Park)|Sharon]], and from a suspicious [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine]] reporter named Brandon Carlile.\n\nTo get back at Cartman for his actions, [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] uses Cartman's private bathroom by claiming to be transgender herself, using the name \"Wendyl\". Cartman is furious at losing his private room. After angrily confronting Principal Victoria, Cartman takes his anger out on Wendy's boyfriend Stan by saying dating her makes him [[gay]]. Stan, now confused, attempts to discuss gender identity with his father, but Randy misunderstands and instead reveals to Stan that he actually is Lorde. He explains that he started using the women's bathroom at work out of convenience, pretending to be a woman, but eventually found the bathroom to be conducive to creating music. He even shows Stan how he uses home studio software to make himself sound like a girl on a song called \"Feeling Good on a Wednesday\". This leaves Stan even more confused. At the Geological Survey, Randy/Lorde's boss proposes a separate bathroom to appease the other women at the office; however, Randy/Lorde says the bathroom is critical for his/her musical creations.\n\n''[[E! News]]'' reports that Lorde is abandoning music and ''Spin'' will reveal the singer's secret. Cartman teases Stan about his gender confusion issues, coining the insult \"cissy\", based on the term \"[[cisgender]]\". Sharon comforts Randy and indirectly encourages him to continue to express himself as Lorde. Randy completes another, more personal song called \"Push\". Enjoying the music, and realizing the deep personal meaning behind it, the female geologists decide to accept Randy's alias, and Brandon Carlile (the ''Spin'' magazine reporter) deletes his expos\u00e9 on Lorde. The school decides to get rid of the transgender bathroom and allow anyone to use the bathroom with which they are most comfortable, thus foiling Cartman's plans. For those who are bothered by transgender people, a new designation is made to keep them away from the normal people who do not care: cissy bathrooms.

Molko eventually leans forward, causing many characters to react in sadness and anguish as if he has jumped; but instead of falling all the way, he impossibly starts walking vertically down the side of the building to about halfway down the building, to the astonishment of all.
