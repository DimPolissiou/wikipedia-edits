This effort to establish a University was again mandated by Article 7, Section 10 of the [[Constitution of Texas|Texas Constitution of 1876]] which directed the legislature to \"establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and direction of a university of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people of this State, and styled \"The University of Texas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1876/a7|title=Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1876)|access-date=January 31, 2015|publisher=Tarlton Library, Jamail Center for Legal Research, [[University of Texas School of Law|School of Law]], University of Texas at Austin|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001624/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1876/a7|archivedate=February 1, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Article 7, Section 11 of the 1876 Constitution established the [[Permanent University Fund]], a sovereign wealth fund managed by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas and dedicated for the maintenance of the university. Because some state legislators perceived an extravagance in the construction of academic buildings of other universities, Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature from using the state's general revenue to fund construction of university buildings. Funds for constructing university buildings had to come from the university's endowment or from private gifts to the university, but the university's operating expenses could come from the state's general revenues.\n[[File:Old Main Building at The University of Texas at Austin .jpg|right|thumb|The university's Old Main building in 1903]]\n\nThe 1876 Constitution also revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858, but dedicated {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} of land, along with other property appropriated for the university, to the Permanent University Fund. This was greatly to the detriment of the university as the lands the Constitution of 1876 granted the university represented less than 5% of the value of the lands granted to the university under the Act of 1858 (the lands close to the railroads were quite valuable, while the lands granted the university were in far west Texas, distant from sources of transportation and water).<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=John J.|title=History of Education in Texas|publisher=United States Bureau of Economics|date=1903|page=144}}</ref> The more valuable lands reverted to the fund to support general education in the state (the Special School Fund).\n\nOn April 10, 1883, the legislature supplemented the Permanent University Fund with another {{Convert|1000000|acre|ha}} of land in west Texas granted to the Texas and Pacific Railroad, but returned to the state as seemingly too worthless to even survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/379/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822\u20131897 Volume 9|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201020004/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/379/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The legislature additionally appropriated $256,272.57 to repay the funds taken from the university in 1860 to pay for frontier defense and for transfers to the state's General Fund in 1861 and 1862.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Charles Ray|title=The Early Years of the Permanent University Fund from 1836 to 1937|publisher=UMI (UMI Number 3284727)|date=2006|page=24}}</ref> The 1883 grant of land increased the land in the Permanent University Fund to almost 2.2&nbsp;million acres.

But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.\n\nIn 1910, George Washington Brackenridge again displayed his philanthropy, this time donating {{convert|500|acre|ha}} on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] to the university. A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing. Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract. The [[Brackenridge Field Laboratory]] was established on {{convert|82|acre|ha}} of the land in 1967.\n[[File:UT architecture library.jpg|thumb|UT Architecture Library]]\nIn 1916, Gov. [[James E. Ferguson]] became involved in a serious quarrel with the University of Texas. The controversy grew out of the board of regents' refusal to remove certain faculty members whom the governor found objectionable. When Ferguson found he could not have his way, he vetoed practically the entire appropriation for the university. Without sufficient funding, the university would have been forced to close its doors. In the middle of the controversy, Ferguson's critics brought to light a number of irregularities on the part of the governor. Eventually, the Texas House of Representatives prepared 21 charges against Ferguson and the Senate convicted him on 10 of them, including misapplication of public funds and receiving $156,000 from an unnamed source. The Texas Senate removed Ferguson as governor and declared him ineligible to hold office.<ref>{{cite HOT|first=Ralph W.|last=Steen|title=Ferguson, James Edward|id=ffe05|date=February 24, 2016|orig-year=June 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the legislature appropriated $1.35&nbsp;million for the purchase of land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well<ref>{{cite HOT|title=Santa Rita Oil Well|id=dos01|first=Julia Cauble|last=Smith|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> and the discovery of [[petroleum|oil]] on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund.

This effort to establish a University was again mandated by Article 7, Section 10 of the [[Constitution of Texas|Texas Constitution of 1876]] which directed the legislature to \"establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and direction of a university of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people of this State, and styled \"The University of Texas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1876/a7|title=Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1876)|access-date=January 31, 2015|publisher=Tarlton Library, Jamail Center for Legal Research, [[University of Texas School of Law|School of Law]], University of Texas at Austin|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001624/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1876/a7|archivedate=February 1, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Article 7, Section 11 of the 1876 Constitution established the [[Permanent University Fund]], a sovereign wealth fund managed by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas and dedicated for the maintenance of the university. Because some state legislators perceived an extravagance in the construction of academic buildings of other universities, Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature from using the state's general revenue to fund construction of university buildings. Funds for constructing university buildings had to come from the university's endowment or from private gifts to the university, but the university's operating expenses could come from the state's general revenues.\n[[File:Old Main Building at The University of Texas at Austin .jpg|right|thumb|The university's Old Main building in 1903]]\n\nThe 1876 Constitution also revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858, but dedicated {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} of land, along with other property appropriated for the university, to the Permanent University Fund. This was greatly to the detriment of the university as the lands the Constitution of 1876 granted the university represented less than 5% of the value of the lands granted to the university under the Act of 1858 (the lands close to the railroads were quite valuable, while the lands granted the university were in far west Texas, distant from sources of transportation and water).<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=John J.|title=History of Education in Texas|publisher=United States Bureau of Economics|date=1903|page=144}}</ref> The more valuable lands reverted to the fund to support general education in the state (the Special School Fund).\n\nOn April 10, 1883, the legislature supplemented the Permanent University Fund with another {{Convert|1000000|acre|ha}} of land in west Texas granted to the Texas and Pacific Railroad, but returned to the state as seemingly too worthless to even survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/379/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822\u20131897 Volume 9|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201020004/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/379/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The legislature additionally appropriated $256,272.57 to repay the funds taken from the university in 1860 to pay for frontier defense and for transfers to the state's General Fund in 1861 and 1862.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Charles Ray|title=The Early Years of the Permanent University Fund from 1836 to 1937|publisher=UMI (UMI Number 3284727)|date=2006|page=24}}</ref> The 1883 grant of land increased the land in the Permanent University Fund to almost 2.2&nbsp;million acres.

But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.\n\nIn 1910, George Washington Brackenridge again displayed his philanthropy, this time donating {{convert|500|acre|ha}} on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] to the university. A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing. Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract. The [[Brackenridge Field Laboratory]] was established on {{convert|82|acre|ha}} of the land in 1967.\n[[File:UT architecture library.jpg|thumb|UT Architecture Library]]\nIn 1916, Gov. [[James E. Ferguson]] became involved in a serious quarrel with the University of Texas. The controversy grew out of the board of regents' refusal to remove certain faculty members whom the governor found objectionable. When Ferguson found he could not have his way, he vetoed practically the entire appropriation for the university. Without sufficient funding, the university would have been forced to close its doors. In the middle of the controversy, Ferguson's critics brought to light a number of irregularities on the part of the governor. Eventually, the Texas House of Representatives prepared 21 charges against Ferguson and the Senate convicted him on 10 of them, including misapplication of public funds and receiving $156,000 from an unnamed source. The Texas Senate removed Ferguson as governor and declared him ineligible to hold office.<ref>{{cite HOT|first=Ralph W.|last=Steen|title=Ferguson, James Edward|id=ffe05|date=February 24, 2016|orig-year=June 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the legislature appropriated $1.35&nbsp;million for the purchase of land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well<ref>{{cite HOT|title=Santa Rita Oil Well|id=dos01|first=Julia Cauble|last=Smith|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> and the discovery of [[petroleum|oil]] on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income from Permanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, which allowed the legislature to address funding for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as [[Texas A&M University]]). With sufficient funds to finance construction on both campuses, on April 8, 1931, the Forty Second Legislature passed H.B. 368.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legislative Reference Library of Texas, HB 368, 42nd Regular Session|url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/sessionLaws/42-0/HB_368_CH_42.pdf|access-date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202215456/http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/sessionLaws/42-0/HB_368_CH_42.pdf|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> which dedicated the Agricultural and Mechanical College a 1/3 interest in the Available University Fund,<ref>{{cite web|title=Texas State Education Code, Title 3, Subtitle C, Chapter 66.02|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.66.htm|access-date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202225320/http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.66.htm|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> the annual income from Permanent University Fund investments.\n\nThe University of Texas was inducted into the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|title=Association of American Universities|url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476|access-date=November 7, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69oUMM90E?url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476|archive-date=August 10, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> During World War II, the University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"list-of-v-12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html|title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II|publisher=HyperWar Foundation|access-date=September 29, 2011|year=2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BpgktZlN?url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html|archive-date=October 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, following [[Sweatt v.

It became the home of the superintendent of the Model Farm and in later years, the deans of Agriculture, including Seaman Knapp and \"Tama Jim\" Wilson.

The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university's prominent features.  Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer.  Courses in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], and [[mining engineering]] were also part of the curriculum.\n\nIn 1870, President Welch and I.

Welch, the president's wife.  Iowa State became the first land grant university in the nation to offer training in domestic economy for college credit.<ref name=\"of Iowa State Time Line, 1858\u20131874\"/>\n\nIn 1879, the School of Veterinary Science was organized, the first state veterinary college in the United States (although veterinary courses had been taught since the beginning of the College).  This was originally a two-year course leading to a diploma.  The veterinary course of study contained classes in zoology, botany, anatomy of domestic animals, veterinary obstetrics, and sanitary science.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1875-1899.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410221627/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html |date=2009-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Iowa state beardshear hall.jpg|thumb|Beardshear Hall]]\nWilliam M.

Webster said, \u201cWhen tillage begins, other\narts follow. The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization.\u201d Wood had\nplanned to create seventeen mural panels for the library, but only the eleven devoted to\nagriculture and the practical arts were completed.

The tower is located on ISU's central campus, just north of the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]]. The site was selected by Margaret's husband, Edgar W. Stanton, with the help of then-university president William M. Beardshear. The campanile stands {{convert|110|ft|m}} tall on a 16 by 16 foot (5 by 5 m) base, and cost $6,510.20 to construct.<ref name=\"lib.iastate.edu\">[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/campanile/camphist.html Iowa State University Library. \"History of the Campanile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607110636/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/campanile/camphist.html |date=2011-06-07 }}</ref>\n\nThe campanile is widely seen as one of the major symbols of Iowa State University.

Noyes, who also donated the funds to see that Alumni Hall could be completed after sitting unfinished and unused from 1905 to 1907.  Dr. Noyes is an 1872 alumnus. Lake LaVerne is located west of the [[#Memorial Union|Memorial Union]] and south of Alumni Hall, [[#Carver Hall|Carver Hall]], and [[#Music Hall|Music Hall]].  The lake was a gift from Dr. Noyes in 1916.\n\nLake LaVerne is the home of two [[mute swan]]s named Sir Lancelot and Elaine, donated to Iowa State by VEISHEA 1935.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm Swans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113121/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm |date=2011-06-07 }} from the Iowa State Library's special exhibits section</ref>  In 1944, 1970, and 1971 [[Cygnet (bird)|cygnets]]  (baby swans) made their home on Lake LaVerne.

In support of Iowa Department of Natural Resources efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.iastate.edu/oldreleases/2003/mar/swans.shtml|title=News Releases: Iowa State University|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Reiman Gardens ===\n[[Image:RG Conservatory Inside.jpg|thumb|Tropical conservatory, [[Reiman Gardens]]]]\nIowa State has maintained a [[horticulture]] garden since 1914. [[Reiman Gardens]] is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from [[Roy Reiman|Bobbi and Roy Reiman]]. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial {{convert|5|acre|m2}} were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.\n\nReiman Gardens has since grown to become a {{convert|14|acre|m2}} site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly \"wing\", butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of [[Jack Trice Stadium]] on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa.\n\nThe Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its [[rose garden]]s are particularly noteworthy.  It was honored with the President's Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the [[United States]] each year for superior rose maintenance and display: \u201cFor contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173000/http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== University Museums ===\nThe University Museums consist of the Brunnier Art Museum, Farm House Museum, the Art on Campus Program, the Christian Petersen Art Museum, and the Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden.

Brunnier and his wife Ann. The decorative arts collection they donated, called the Brunnier Collection, is extensive, consisting of ceramics, glass, dolls, ivory, jade, and enameled metals.\n\nOther fine and decorative art objects from the University Art Collection include prints, paintings, sculptures, textiles, carpets, wood objects, lacquered pieces, silver, and furniture. About eight to 12 annual changing exhibitions and permanent collection exhibitions provide educational opportunities for all ages, from learning the history of a quilt hand-stitched over 100 years ago to discovering how scientists analyze the physical properties of artists' materials, such as glass or stone.  Lectures, receptions, conferences, university classes, panel discussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks are presented to assist with further interpretation of objects.\n\n==== Farm House Museum ====\n[[Image:Farm House Museum south sign.jpg|thumb|The Farm House Museum]]\n{{main|The Farm House (Knapp\u2013Wilson House)}}\nLocated near the center of the Iowa State campus, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture as well as a [[National Historic Landmark]].  As the first building on campus, the Farm House was built in 1860 before campus was occupied by students or even classrooms. The college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. This early practice lead to Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm opening its doors to Iowa students for free in 1869 under the [[Morrill Act of 1862|Morrill Act]] (or Land-grant Act) of 1862.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/FarmHouse.htm Iowa State University Museums Farm House Museum online]</ref>\n\nMany prominent figures have made the Farm House their home throughout its 150 years of use. The first president of the College, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and even wrote his inaugural speech in a bedroom on the second floor.  James \u201cTama Jim\u201d Wilson resided for much of the 1890s with his family at the Farm House until he joined President [[William McKinley]]'s cabinet as [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]]. Agriculture Dean [[Charles Curtiss]] and his young family replaced Wilson and became the longest resident of Farm House.\n\nIn 1976, over 110 years after the initial construction, the Farm House became a museum after much time and effort was put into restoring the early beauty of the modest farm home.  Today, faculty, students, and community members can enjoy the museum while honoring its significance in shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university. Its collection boasts a large collection of 19th and early 20th century decorative arts, furnishings and material culture reflecting Iowa State and Iowa heritage.  Objects include furnishings from [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] and Charles Curtiss, a wide variety of quilts, a modest collection of textiles and apparel, and various china and glassware items.\n\nAs with many sites on the Iowa State University Campus, The Farm House Museum has a few old [[Iowa State Myths and Legends|myths and legends]] associated with it. There are rumors of a ghost changing silverware and dinnerware, unexplained rattling furniture, and curtains that have opened seemingly by themselves.\n\nThe Farm House Museum is a unique on-campus educational resource providing a changing environment of exhibitions among the historical permanent collection objects that are on display. A walk through the Farm House Museum immerses visitors in the [[Victorian era]] (1860-1910) as well as exhibits colorful Iowa and local Ames history.\n\n==== Art on Campus Collection ====\nIowa State is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States.  Over 2,000 works of public art, including 600 by significant national and international artists, are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and offices.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/AOC.htm Iowa State University Museums Art on Campus online]</ref>\n\nThe traditional public art program began during the Depression in the 1930s when Iowa State College's President Raymond Hughes envisioned that \"the arts would enrich and provide substantial intellectual exploration into our college curricula.\" Hughes invited [[Grant Wood]] to create the Library's agricultural murals that speak to the founding of Iowa and Iowa State College and Model Farm. He also offered [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]] a one-semester sculptor residency to design and build the fountain and bas relief at the Dairy Industry Building. In 1955, 21 years later, Petersen retired having created 12 major sculptures for the campus and hundreds of small studio sculptures.\n\nThe Art on Campus Collection is a campus-wide resource of over 2000 public works of art. Programs, receptions, dedications, university classes, Wednesday Walks, and educational tours are presented on a regular basis to enhance visual literacy and aesthetic appreciation of this diverse collection.\n\n==== Christian Petersen Art Museum ====\n[[Image:Justin Smith Morrill - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Justin Smith Morrill]], namesake of Morrill Hall]]\nThe Christian Petersen Art Museum in [[Morrill Hall (Iowa State University)|Morrill Hall]] is named for the nation's first permanent campus artist-in-residence, [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]], who sculpted and taught at Iowa State from 1934 through 1955, and is considered the founding artist of the Art on Campus Collection.\n\nNamed for [[Justin Smith Morrill]] who created the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], Morrill Hall was completed in 1891.  Originally constructed to fill the capacity of a library, museum, and chapel, its original uses are engraved in the exterior stonework on the east side.  The building was vacated in 1996 when it was determined unsafe and was also listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the same year.  In 2005, $9 million was raised to renovate the building and convert it into a museum.  Completed and reopened in March 2007, Morrill Hall is home to the Christian Petersen Art Museum.\n\nAs part of University Museums, the Christian Petersen Art Museum at Morrill Hall is the home of the Christian Petersen Art Collection, the Art on Campus Program, the University Museums's Visual Literacy and Learning Program, and Contemporary Changing Art Exhibitions Program.\n\nLocated within the Christian Petersen Art Museum are the Lyle and Nancy Campbell Art Gallery, the Roy and Bobbi Reiman Public Art Studio Gallery, the Margaret Davidson Center for the Study of the Art on Campus Collection, the Edith D. and Torsten E. Lagerstrom Loaned Collections Center, and the Neva M. Petersen Visual Learning Gallery. University Museums shares the James R. and Barbara R. Palmer Small Objects Classroom in Morrill Hall.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/CPAM.htm Iowa State University Museums Christian Petersen Art Museum online]</ref>\n\n==== Anderson Sculpture Garden ====\nThe Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located by the Christian Petersen Art Museum at historic Morrill Hall. The [[sculpture garden]] design incorporates sculptures, a gathering arena, and sidewalks and pathways. Planted with perennials, ground cover, shrubs, and flowering trees, the landscape design provides a distinctive setting for important works of 20th and 21st century sculpture, primarily American.  Ranging from forty-four inches to nearly nine feet high and from bronze to other metals, these works of art represent the richly diverse character of modern and contemporary sculpture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.iastate.edu/ASGMain.htm|title=Anderson Sculpture Garden Main|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe sculpture garden is adjacent to Iowa State's {{convert|22|acre|m2}} central campus. Adonijah Welch, ISU's first president, envisioned a picturesque campus with a winding road encircling the college's majestic buildings, vast lawns of green grass, many varieties of trees sprinkled throughout to provide shade, and shrubbery and flowers for fragrance. Today, the central lawn continues to be an iconic place for all Iowa Staters, and enjoys national acclaim as one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.  The new Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden further enhances the beauty of Iowa State.\n\n=== Sustainability ===\nIowa State's composting facility is capable of processing over 10,000 tons of organic waste every year.<ref name=\"ISU promotes sustainability via an all-university compost facility.\">{{cite web\n| title =ISU promotes sustainability via an all-university compost facility| publisher =Iowa State University News| url =http://www.public.iastate.edu/~nscentral/news/2009/may/compost.shtml\n| accessdate = June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"New web site charts campus building energy use\">{{cite web| title =New web site charts campus building energy use| publisher =Iowa State University| url =http://www.iastate.edu/Inside/2009/0417/energywatch.shtml| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090420225219/http://www.iastate.edu/Inside/2009/0417/energywatch.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date =2009-04-20| accessdate =2009-06-10}}</ref> The school's $3 million revolving loan fund loans money for energy efficiency and conservation projects on campus.<ref name=\"Live Green revolving loan fund\">{{cite web| title =Live Green revolving loan fund| publisher =Iowa State University News| url =http://www.livegreen.iastate.edu/loan/| accessdate =2009-06-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104949/http://www.livegreen.iastate.edu/loan/| archivedate =2009-05-03| df =}}</ref> In the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card issued by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the university received a B grade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/iowa-state-university |title=Iowa State University - Green Report Card 2011 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Residence halls ===\n[[File:Roberts Residence Hall Iowa State University.jpg|thumb|View looking east towards Roberts Hall]]\n\nIowa State operates 20 on-campus [[dormitory|residence halls]].

Proudfoot. The building employs a classical style of [[architecture]] reflecting [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influences. The building's design specifically complements the designs of the major buildings surrounding the University's Central Campus area, Beardshear Hall to the west, Curtiss Hall to the east, and MacKay Hall to the north.  The style utilizes columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals, Palladian windows, triangular [[pediments]], and formally balanced [[facades]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mu.iastate.edu/en/about_the_mu/architecture|title=Architecture|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\nDesigned to be a living memorial for ISU students lost in [[World War I]], the building includes a solemn memorial hall, named the Gold Star Room, which honors the names of the dead World War I, [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korean]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[War on Terrorism]] veterans engraved in marble.  Symbolically, the hall was built directly over a library (the Browsing Library) and a small chapel, the symbol being that no country would ever send its young men to die in a war for a noble cause without a solid foundation on both education (the library) and religion (the chapel).\n\nRenovations and additions have continued through the years to include: elevators, bowling lanes, a parking ramp, a book store, food court, and additional wings.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe Choral Division of the Department of Music and Theater at Iowa State University consists of over 400 choristers in four main ensembles \u2013 the ''Iowa State Singers'', ''Cantamus,'' the ''Iowa Statesmen'', and ''Lyrica'' \u2013 and multiple small ensembles including three a cappella groups, ''Count Me In'' (female), ''Shy of a Dozen'' (male), and \"Hymn and Her\" (co-ed).\n\n=== Greek community ===\nISU is home to an active [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]].

That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as [[tornado]]es were called at the time). In September, Iowa Agricultural College's football team traveled to [[Northwestern University]] and defeated that team by a score of 36\u20130. The next day, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s headline read \"Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.\"<ref name=\"isutimeline1875\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/~isu150/history/timeline-1875.html|title=Iowa State University Time Line, 1875-1899 |work=iastate.edu}}</ref> The article began, \"Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday.\" The nickname stuck.\n\nThe school colors are [[cardinal (color)|cardinal]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The mascot is [[Cy the Cardinal]], introduced in 1954. Since a cyclone was determined to be difficult to depict in costume, the cardinal was chosen in reference to the school colors. A contest was held to select a name for the mascot, with the name Cy being chosen as the winner.\n\nThe Iowa State Cyclones are a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] and compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), fielding 16 varsity teams in 12 sports. The Cyclones also compete in and are a founding member of the [[Central States Collegiate Hockey League]] of the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]].\n\nIowa State's intrastate [[College rivalry|archrival]] is the [[University of Iowa]] with whom it competes annually for the [[Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series]] trophy, an annual athletic competition between the two schools.

Trice died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] on October 6, 1923.  Suffering from a broken collarbone early in the game, he continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players.

Hoiberg (\"The Mayor\") played three seasons under legendary coach [[Johnny Orr (basketball, born 1927)|Johnny Orr]] and one season under future [[Chicago Bulls]] coach [[Tim Floyd]] during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991\u201395).  Orr laid the foundation of success in men's basketball upon his arrival from [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic.  Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including [[Jeff Grayer]], [[Barry Stevens (basketball)|Barry Stevens]], and walk-on [[Jeff Hornacek]].  The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable.  Orr coached the team to second place in the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the second round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]].\n\nUnder coaches Floyd (1995\u201398) and [[Larry Eustachy]] (1998\u20132003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000\u201301, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated [[UCLA]] in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]' narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout [[Marcus Fizer]] and [[Jamaal Tinsley]] were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32\u20135.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed [[Hampton University|Hampton]] in the first round.\n\nIn 2011\u201312, Hoiberg's Cyclones finished third in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA Tournament, dethroning defending national champion [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], 77\u201364, in the second round before losing in the Round of 32 to top-seeded [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]].  All-Big 12 First Team selection [[Royce White]] led the Cyclones with 38 points and 22 rebounds in the two contests, ending the season at 23\u201311.\n\nThe 2013-14 campaign turned out to be another highly successful season.  Iowa State went 28\u20138, won the Big 12 Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by beating [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Cyclones finished 11\u20137 in Big 12 play, finishing in a tie for third in the league standings, and beat a school-record nine teams (9-3) that were ranked in the Associated Press top 25.  The Cyclones opened the season 14\u20130, breaking the school record for consecutive wins. [[Melvin Ejim]] was named the Big 12 Player of the Year and an All-American by five organizations.  Deandre Kane was named the Big 12 Tournament's most valuable player.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, Steve Prohm took over as head basketball coach replacing Hoiberg who left to take the head coaching position with the Chicago Bulls.  In his first season with the Cyclones, Prohm secured a #4 seed in the Midwest region where the Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to top-seeded [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], 84\u201371. In 2017, Iowa State stunned 3rd ranked [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], 92\u201389, in overtime, snapping KU's 54-game home winning streak, before winning the [[2017 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]], its third conference championship in four years, defeating [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] in the final.\n\nOf Iowa State's 19 NCAA Tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen six times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000, 2014, 2016), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Iowa State Men's Basketball Media Guide\" Iowa State University. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle,dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&ATCLID=1608347&KEY=&DB_OEM_ID=10700&DB_LANG=&IN_SUBSCRIBE.html }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Women's basketball ===\n{{main|Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball}}\nIowa State is known for having one of the most successful women's basketball programs in the nation.

The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and two women.<ref name=\"of Iowa State Time Line, 1858\u20131874\"/>\n\nThe Farm House, the first building on the Iowa State campus, was completed in 1861 before the campus was occupied by students or classrooms.  It became the home of the superintendent of the Model Farm and in later years, the deans of Agriculture, including Seaman Knapp and \"Tama Jim\" Wilson. Iowa State's first president, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and penned his inaugural speech in a second floor bedroom.<ref name=\"of Iowa State Time Line, 1858\u20131874\"/>\n\nThe college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university's prominent features.  Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer.  Courses in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], and [[mining engineering]] were also part of the curriculum.\n\nIn 1870, President Welch and I. P. Roberts, professor of agriculture,<ref>Isaac Phillips Roberts (1916) [https://archive.org/details/autobiographyoff00robe/page/152 Autobiography of a Farm Boy] via [[Internet Archive]]</ref> held three-day farmers' institutes at [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], [[Washington, Iowa|Washington]], and [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]].  These became the earliest institutes held off-campus by a land grant institution and were the forerunners of 20th century extension.\n\nIn 1872, the first courses were given in domestic economy (home economics, family and consumer sciences) and were taught by Mary B. Welch, the president's wife.  Iowa State became the first land grant university in the nation to offer training in domestic economy for college credit.<ref name=\"of Iowa State Time Line, 1858\u20131874\"/>\n\nIn 1879, the School of Veterinary Science was organized, the first state veterinary college in the United States (although veterinary courses had been taught since the beginning of the College).  This was originally a two-year course leading to a diploma.  The veterinary course of study contained classes in zoology, botany, anatomy of domestic animals, veterinary obstetrics, and sanitary science.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1875-1899.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410221627/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html |date=2009-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Iowa state beardshear hall.jpg|thumb|Beardshear Hall]]\nWilliam M.

Beardshear developed new agricultural programs and was instrumental in hiring premier faculty members such as Anson Marston, Louis B. Spinney, J.B. Weems, Perry G. Holden, and Maria Roberts.  He also expanded the university administration, and added Morrill Hall (1891), the Campanile (1899), Old Botany (now Carrie Chapman Catt Hall) (1892), and Margaret Hall (1895) to the campus, all of which stand today.

The idea was first proposed by Professor Samuel Beyer, the college's \u201cpatron saint of athletics,\u201d who suggested that Iowa State inaugurate a celebration for alumni during the annual football game against rival University of Iowa. Iowa State's new president, Raymond A. Pearson, liked the idea and issued a special invitation to alumni two weeks prior to the event: \u201cWe need you, we must have you.

Robert Parks (1915\u20132003), the 11th president of Iowa State University, and his wife, Ellen Sorge Parks, the original library was built in 1925 with three subsequent additions made in 1961, 1969, and 1983. The library was dedicated and named after W. Robert and Ellen Sorge Parks in 1984.<ref>[http://www.ir.iastate.edu/FB11/PDF/FB11-020.pdf ISU Fact Book 2010-2011.

Facilities consist of the main Parks Library, the e-Library, the Veterinary Medical Library, two subject-oriented reading rooms (design and mathematics), and a remote library storage building.\n\nThe Library's extensive collections include electronic and print resources that support research and study for all undergraduate and graduate programs.  Nationally recognized collections support the basic and applied fields of biological and physical sciences. The Parks Library includes four public service desks: the Learning Connections Center, the Circulation Desk, the Media Center (including Maps, Media,\nMicroforms, and Course Reserve collections), and Special Collections. The Library's instruction program includes a required undergraduate information literacy course as well as a wide variety of subject-based seminars on the effective use of Library resources for undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe e-Library, accessed through the Internet, provides access to local and Web-based resources including electronic journals and books, local collections, online indexes, electronic course reserves and guides, and a broad range of subject research guides.\n\nSurrounding the first floor lobby staircase in Parks Library are eight mural panels\ndesigned by Iowa artist [[Grant Wood]]. As with ''Breaking the Prairie Sod'', Wood's other\nIowa State University mural painted two years later, Wood borrowed his theme for ''When Tillage Begins Other Arts Follow'' from a speech on [[agriculture]] delivered by Daniel\nWebster in 1840 at the State House in [[Boston]]. Webster said, \u201cWhen tillage begins, other\narts follow. The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization.\u201d Wood had\nplanned to create seventeen mural panels for the library, but only the eleven devoted to\nagriculture and the practical arts were completed. The final six, which would have hung\nin the main reading room (now the Periodical Room) and were to have depicted the fine\narts, were never begun.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/libinfo/factsfigs.html It's a Fact: Iowa State University.

Committed to community, Iowa State pioneered the outreach mission of being a land-grant college through creation of the first Extension Service in 1902.  In 1906, the [[Iowa Legislature]] enacted the Agricultural Extension Act making funds available for demonstration projects.  It is believed this was the first specific legislation establishing state extension work, for which Iowa State assumed responsibility.  The national extension program was created in 1914 based heavily on the Iowa State model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/dubuque/info/history.htm|title=Extension Service: A Historical Perspective |accessdate=2016-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/about/highlights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095050/http://www.iastate.edu/about/highlights/ |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/IaStater/1997/feb/landgrant.html |title=Land-grant universities born from radical idea |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527124225/http://www.iastate.edu/IaStater/1997/feb/landgrant.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== VEISHEA celebration ===\n{{main|VEISHEA}}\n[[Image:VEISHEA2006.jpg|thumb|The [[VEISHEA]] 2006 Battle of the Bands]]\nIowa State is widely known for VEISHEA, an annual education and entertainment festival that was held on campus each spring.

Previously Sir Lancelot and Elaine were [[trumpeter swan]]s but were too aggressive and in 1999 were replaced with two mute swans.\n\nIn early spring 2003, Lake LaVerne welcomed its newest and most current mute swan duo. In support of Iowa Department of Natural Resources efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.iastate.edu/oldreleases/2003/mar/swans.shtml|title=News Releases: Iowa State University|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Reiman Gardens ===\n[[Image:RG Conservatory Inside.jpg|thumb|Tropical conservatory, [[Reiman Gardens]]]]\nIowa State has maintained a [[horticulture]] garden since 1914. [[Reiman Gardens]] is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from [[Roy Reiman|Bobbi and Roy Reiman]]. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial {{convert|5|acre|m2}} were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.\n\nReiman Gardens has since grown to become a {{convert|14|acre|m2}} site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly \"wing\", butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of [[Jack Trice Stadium]] on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa.\n\nThe Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its [[rose garden]]s are particularly noteworthy.  It was honored with the President's Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the [[United States]] each year for superior rose maintenance and display: \u201cFor contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173000/http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== University Museums ===\nThe University Museums consist of the Brunnier Art Museum, Farm House Museum, the Art on Campus Program, the Christian Petersen Art Museum, and the Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden. The Museums include a multitude of unique exhibits, each promoting the understanding and delight of the visual arts as well as attempt to incorporate a vast interaction between the arts, sciences, and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.iastate.edu|title=University Museums|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\n==== Brunnier Art Museum ====\nThe Brunnier Art Museum, Iowa's only accredited museum emphasizing a [[decorative arts]] collection, is one of the nation's few museums located within a performing arts and conference complex, the [[Iowa State Center]].<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/Brunnier.htm Iowa State University Museums Brunnier Art Museum online]</ref> Founded in 1975, the museum is named after its benefactors, Iowa State alumnus Henry J. Brunnier and his wife Ann. The decorative arts collection they donated, called the Brunnier Collection, is extensive, consisting of ceramics, glass, dolls, ivory, jade, and enameled metals.\n\nOther fine and decorative art objects from the University Art Collection include prints, paintings, sculptures, textiles, carpets, wood objects, lacquered pieces, silver, and furniture. About eight to 12 annual changing exhibitions and permanent collection exhibitions provide educational opportunities for all ages, from learning the history of a quilt hand-stitched over 100 years ago to discovering how scientists analyze the physical properties of artists' materials, such as glass or stone.  Lectures, receptions, conferences, university classes, panel discussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks are presented to assist with further interpretation of objects.\n\n==== Farm House Museum ====\n[[Image:Farm House Museum south sign.jpg|thumb|The Farm House Museum]]\n{{main|The Farm House (Knapp\u2013Wilson House)}}\nLocated near the center of the Iowa State campus, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture as well as a [[National Historic Landmark]].  As the first building on campus, the Farm House was built in 1860 before campus was occupied by students or even classrooms. The college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. This early practice lead to Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm opening its doors to Iowa students for free in 1869 under the [[Morrill Act of 1862|Morrill Act]] (or Land-grant Act) of 1862.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/FarmHouse.htm Iowa State University Museums Farm House Museum online]</ref>\n\nMany prominent figures have made the Farm House their home throughout its 150 years of use. The first president of the College, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and even wrote his inaugural speech in a bedroom on the second floor.  James \u201cTama Jim\u201d Wilson resided for much of the 1890s with his family at the Farm House until he joined President [[William McKinley]]'s cabinet as [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]]. Agriculture Dean [[Charles Curtiss]] and his young family replaced Wilson and became the longest resident of Farm House.\n\nIn 1976, over 110 years after the initial construction, the Farm House became a museum after much time and effort was put into restoring the early beauty of the modest farm home.  Today, faculty, students, and community members can enjoy the museum while honoring its significance in shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university. Its collection boasts a large collection of 19th and early 20th century decorative arts, furnishings and material culture reflecting Iowa State and Iowa heritage.  Objects include furnishings from [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] and Charles Curtiss, a wide variety of quilts, a modest collection of textiles and apparel, and various china and glassware items.\n\nAs with many sites on the Iowa State University Campus, The Farm House Museum has a few old [[Iowa State Myths and Legends|myths and legends]] associated with it. There are rumors of a ghost changing silverware and dinnerware, unexplained rattling furniture, and curtains that have opened seemingly by themselves.\n\nThe Farm House Museum is a unique on-campus educational resource providing a changing environment of exhibitions among the historical permanent collection objects that are on display. A walk through the Farm House Museum immerses visitors in the [[Victorian era]] (1860-1910) as well as exhibits colorful Iowa and local Ames history.\n\n==== Art on Campus Collection ====\nIowa State is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States.  Over 2,000 works of public art, including 600 by significant national and international artists, are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and offices.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/AOC.htm Iowa State University Museums Art on Campus online]</ref>\n\nThe traditional public art program began during the Depression in the 1930s when Iowa State College's President Raymond Hughes envisioned that \"the arts would enrich and provide substantial intellectual exploration into our college curricula.\" Hughes invited [[Grant Wood]] to create the Library's agricultural murals that speak to the founding of Iowa and Iowa State College and Model Farm. He also offered [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]] a one-semester sculptor residency to design and build the fountain and bas relief at the Dairy Industry Building. In 1955, 21 years later, Petersen retired having created 12 major sculptures for the campus and hundreds of small studio sculptures.\n\nThe Art on Campus Collection is a campus-wide resource of over 2000 public works of art. Programs, receptions, dedications, university classes, Wednesday Walks, and educational tours are presented on a regular basis to enhance visual literacy and aesthetic appreciation of this diverse collection.\n\n==== Christian Petersen Art Museum ====\n[[Image:Justin Smith Morrill - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Justin Smith Morrill]], namesake of Morrill Hall]]\nThe Christian Petersen Art Museum in [[Morrill Hall (Iowa State University)|Morrill Hall]] is named for the nation's first permanent campus artist-in-residence, [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]], who sculpted and taught at Iowa State from 1934 through 1955, and is considered the founding artist of the Art on Campus Collection.\n\nNamed for [[Justin Smith Morrill]] who created the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], Morrill Hall was completed in 1891.  Originally constructed to fill the capacity of a library, museum, and chapel, its original uses are engraved in the exterior stonework on the east side.  The building was vacated in 1996 when it was determined unsafe and was also listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the same year.  In 2005, $9 million was raised to renovate the building and convert it into a museum.  Completed and reopened in March 2007, Morrill Hall is home to the Christian Petersen Art Museum.\n\nAs part of University Museums, the Christian Petersen Art Museum at Morrill Hall is the home of the Christian Petersen Art Collection, the Art on Campus Program, the University Museums's Visual Literacy and Learning Program, and Contemporary Changing Art Exhibitions Program.\n\nLocated within the Christian Petersen Art Museum are the Lyle and Nancy Campbell Art Gallery, the Roy and Bobbi Reiman Public Art Studio Gallery, the Margaret Davidson Center for the Study of the Art on Campus Collection, the Edith D. and Torsten E. Lagerstrom Loaned Collections Center, and the Neva M. Petersen Visual Learning Gallery. University Museums shares the James R. and Barbara R. Palmer Small Objects Classroom in Morrill Hall.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/CPAM.htm Iowa State University Museums Christian Petersen Art Museum online]</ref>\n\n==== Anderson Sculpture Garden ====\nThe Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located by the Christian Petersen Art Museum at historic Morrill Hall. The [[sculpture garden]] design incorporates sculptures, a gathering arena, and sidewalks and pathways. Planted with perennials, ground cover, shrubs, and flowering trees, the landscape design provides a distinctive setting for important works of 20th and 21st century sculpture, primarily American.  Ranging from forty-four inches to nearly nine feet high and from bronze to other metals, these works of art represent the richly diverse character of modern and contemporary sculpture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.iastate.edu/ASGMain.htm|title=Anderson Sculpture Garden Main|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe sculpture garden is adjacent to Iowa State's {{convert|22|acre|m2}} central campus. Adonijah Welch, ISU's first president, envisioned a picturesque campus with a winding road encircling the college's majestic buildings, vast lawns of green grass, many varieties of trees sprinkled throughout to provide shade, and shrubbery and flowers for fragrance. Today, the central lawn continues to be an iconic place for all Iowa Staters, and enjoys national acclaim as one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.  The new Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden further enhances the beauty of Iowa State.\n\n=== Sustainability ===\nIowa State's composting facility is capable of processing over 10,000 tons of organic waste every year.<ref name=\"ISU promotes sustainability via an all-university compost facility.\">{{cite web\n| title =ISU promotes sustainability via an all-university compost facility| publisher =Iowa State University News| url =http://www.public.iastate.edu/~nscentral/news/2009/may/compost.shtml\n| accessdate = June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"New web site charts campus building energy use\">{{cite web| title =New web site charts campus building energy use| publisher =Iowa State University| url =http://www.iastate.edu/Inside/2009/0417/energywatch.shtml| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090420225219/http://www.iastate.edu/Inside/2009/0417/energywatch.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date =2009-04-20| accessdate =2009-06-10}}</ref> The school's $3 million revolving loan fund loans money for energy efficiency and conservation projects on campus.<ref name=\"Live Green revolving loan fund\">{{cite web| title =Live Green revolving loan fund| publisher =Iowa State University News| url =http://www.livegreen.iastate.edu/loan/| accessdate =2009-06-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104949/http://www.livegreen.iastate.edu/loan/| archivedate =2009-05-03| df =}}</ref> In the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card issued by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the university received a B grade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/iowa-state-university |title=Iowa State University - Green Report Card 2011 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Residence halls ===\n[[File:Roberts Residence Hall Iowa State University.jpg|thumb|View looking east towards Roberts Hall]]\n\nIowa State operates 20 on-campus [[dormitory|residence halls]].

Organizations are supported by Iowa State's Student Activities Center. Many student organization offices are housed in the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]].\n\nThe Memorial Union at Iowa State University opened in September 1928 and is currently home to a number of University departments and student organizations, a bowling alley, the University Book Store, and the Hotel Memorial Union.\n\nThe original building was designed by architect, William T. Proudfoot. The building employs a classical style of [[architecture]] reflecting [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influences. The building's design specifically complements the designs of the major buildings surrounding the University's Central Campus area, Beardshear Hall to the west, Curtiss Hall to the east, and MacKay Hall to the north.  The style utilizes columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals, Palladian windows, triangular [[pediments]], and formally balanced [[facades]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mu.iastate.edu/en/about_the_mu/architecture|title=Architecture|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>\n\nDesigned to be a living memorial for ISU students lost in [[World War I]], the building includes a solemn memorial hall, named the Gold Star Room, which honors the names of the dead World War I, [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korean]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[War on Terrorism]] veterans engraved in marble.  Symbolically, the hall was built directly over a library (the Browsing Library) and a small chapel, the symbol being that no country would ever send its young men to die in a war for a noble cause without a solid foundation on both education (the library) and religion (the chapel).\n\nRenovations and additions have continued through the years to include: elevators, bowling lanes, a parking ramp, a book store, food court, and additional wings.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe Choral Division of the Department of Music and Theater at Iowa State University consists of over 400 choristers in four main ensembles \u2013 the ''Iowa State Singers'', ''Cantamus,'' the ''Iowa Statesmen'', and ''Lyrica'' \u2013 and multiple small ensembles including three a cappella groups, ''Count Me In'' (female), ''Shy of a Dozen'' (male), and \"Hymn and Her\" (co-ed).\n\n=== Greek community ===\nISU is home to an active [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]].

Hoiberg (\"The Mayor\") played three seasons under legendary coach [[Johnny Orr (basketball, born 1927)|Johnny Orr]] and one season under future [[Chicago Bulls]] coach [[Tim Floyd]] during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991\u201395).  Orr laid the foundation of success in men's basketball upon his arrival from [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic.  Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including [[Jeff Grayer]], [[Barry Stevens (basketball)|Barry Stevens]], and walk-on [[Jeff Hornacek]].  The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable.  Orr coached the team to second place in the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the second round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]].\n\nUnder coaches Floyd (1995\u201398) and [[Larry Eustachy]] (1998\u20132003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000\u201301, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated [[UCLA]] in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]' narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout [[Marcus Fizer]] and [[Jamaal Tinsley]] were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32\u20135.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed [[Hampton University|Hampton]] in the first round.\n\nIn 2011\u201312, Hoiberg's Cyclones finished third in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA Tournament, dethroning defending national champion [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], 77\u201364, in the second round before losing in the Round of 32 to top-seeded [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]].  All-Big 12 First Team selection [[Royce White]] led the Cyclones with 38 points and 22 rebounds in the two contests, ending the season at 23\u201311.\n\nThe 2013-14 campaign turned out to be another highly successful season.  Iowa State went 28\u20138, won the Big 12 Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by beating [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Cyclones finished 11\u20137 in Big 12 play, finishing in a tie for third in the league standings, and beat a school-record nine teams (9-3) that were ranked in the Associated Press top 25.  The Cyclones opened the season 14\u20130, breaking the school record for consecutive wins. [[Melvin Ejim]] was named the Big 12 Player of the Year and an All-American by five organizations.  Deandre Kane was named the Big 12 Tournament's most valuable player.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, Steve Prohm took over as head basketball coach replacing Hoiberg who left to take the head coaching position with the Chicago Bulls.  In his first season with the Cyclones, Prohm secured a #4 seed in the Midwest region where the Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to top-seeded [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], 84\u201371. In 2017, Iowa State stunned 3rd ranked [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], 92\u201389, in overtime, snapping KU's 54-game home winning streak, before winning the [[2017 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]], its third conference championship in four years, defeating [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] in the final.\n\nOf Iowa State's 19 NCAA Tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen six times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000, 2014, 2016), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Iowa State Men's Basketball Media Guide\" Iowa State University. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle,dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&ATCLID=1608347&KEY=&DB_OEM_ID=10700&DB_LANG=&IN_SUBSCRIBE.html }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Women's basketball ===\n{{main|Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball}}\nIowa State is known for having one of the most successful women's basketball programs in the nation.

One such example was seen in 1887, when Case physicist [[Albert Michelson]] and Reserve chemist [[Edward Morley]] collaborated on the famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nThere had been some discussion of a merger of the two institutions as early as 1890, but those talks dissolved quickly. In the 1920s, the Survey Commission on Higher Education in Cleveland took a strong stand in favor of federation and the community was behind the idea as well, but in the end all that came of the study was a decision by the two institutions to cooperate in founding Cleveland College, a special unit for part-time and adult students in [[downtown Cleveland]].\n\nBy the 1960s, Reserve President [[John S. Millis|John Schoff Millis]] and Case President [[T. Keith Glennan]] shared the idea that federation would create a complete university, one better able to attain national distinction. Financed by the [[Carnegie Corporation]], [[Cleveland Foundation]], [[Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation]], and several local donors, a study commission of national leaders in higher education and public policy was charged with exploring the idea of federation. The Heald Commission, so known for its chair, former [[Ford Foundation]] President [[Henry Townley Heald|Henry T.

[[Amasa Stone]]'s gift to relocate Western Reserve College to Cleveland also included a provision for the purchase of land in the [[University Circle]] area, adjacent to Western Reserve University, for the Case School of Applied Science. The school relocated to [[University Circle]] in 1885.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Case School of Applied Science was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"case-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://usna50.8k.com/1950-1959.htm |title=Deceased Classmates in the Year 1950-1959 |publisher=[[United States Naval Academy]] |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319054220/http://usna50.8k.com/1950-1959.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOver time, the Case School of Applied Science expanded to encompass broader subjects, adopting the name Case Institute of Technology in 1947 to reflect the institution's growth.<ref name=\"case.edu\"/>\n\nLed by polymer expert [[Eric Baer]] in 1963, the nation's first stand-alone Polymer Science and Engineering program was founded, to eventually become the Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://engineering.case.edu/macromolecular-science-and-engineering/history|title=History - Case School of Engineering|website=engineering.case.edu|accessdate=19 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516081842/https://engineering.case.edu/macromolecular-science-and-engineering/history|archive-date=May 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Federation of two universities===\nAlthough the trustees of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University did not formally federate their institutions until 1967, the institutions already shared buildings and staff when necessary and worked together often. One such example was seen in 1887, when Case physicist [[Albert Michelson]] and Reserve chemist [[Edward Morley]] collaborated on the famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nThere had been some discussion of a merger of the two institutions as early as 1890, but those talks dissolved quickly. In the 1920s, the Survey Commission on Higher Education in Cleveland took a strong stand in favor of federation and the community was behind the idea as well, but in the end all that came of the study was a decision by the two institutions to cooperate in founding Cleveland College, a special unit for part-time and adult students in [[downtown Cleveland]].\n\nBy the 1960s, Reserve President [[John S. Millis|John Schoff Millis]] and Case President [[T. Keith Glennan]] shared the idea that federation would create a complete university, one better able to attain national distinction. Financed by the [[Carnegie Corporation]], [[Cleveland Foundation]], [[Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation]], and several local donors, a study commission of national leaders in higher education and public policy was charged with exploring the idea of federation. The Heald Commission, so known for its chair, former [[Ford Foundation]] President [[Henry Townley Heald|Henry T. Heald]], issued its final report, \"Vision of a University.\" The report predicted that a federation could create one of the largest private universities in the nation.\n\n===Case Western Reserve University (1967\u2013present)===\nIn 1967, Case Institute of Technology, a school with its emphasis on engineering and science, and Western Reserve University, a school with professional programs and liberal arts, came together to form Case Western Reserve University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.case.edu/visit/history/fed.html |title=Visiting Case: Case Western Reserve University |publisher=Case.edu |date=1967-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035412/http://www.case.edu/visit/history/fed.html |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the [[CWRU Biomedical Engineering|Department of Biomedical Engineering]] launched as a newly unified collaboration between the [[Case School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] and [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] as the first in the nation and as one of the first [[Biomedical Engineering]] programs in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspapers.case.edu/?a=d&d=RT19680517-01.2.18&srpos=12&e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-%22biomedical%22------|title=The Reserve Tribune 17 May 1968 \u2014 Case Western Reserve University|website=Newspapers.case.edu|accessdate=19 May 2019}}</ref> The following year in 1969, the first Biomedical Engineering MD/PhD program in the world began at Case Western Reserve.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The History of Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University 1960 - 2009|last=Gill|first=Kathy|year=2009|location=Cleveland}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[computer engineering]] degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at Case Western Reserve.\n\nThe \"Forward Thinking\" campaign was launched in 2011 by President [[Barbara Snyder]] to fundraise $1 billion, the largest in school history.

While historical information can be useful, interesting and can provide insights to individuals, I don't think that it's the sure foundation of faith. The sure foundation of faith is spiritual and not physical. ... [T]he more an individual learns about the history of the Church, the greater that individual's understanding will be of the overall picture. Thus, every piece of evidence will be viewed against the total picture. Otherwise, people who do not have much knowledge of Church history may find themselves being tossed to and fro by tidbits from the past.<ref name=devotee/></blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book\n | author        = Turley, Richard E.

To tell the story from the perspectives of the murder victims and the LDS Church (which Turley believed had been misrepresented) he published ''Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case'' in 1992 through the [[University of Illinois Press]]. Though he wrote the book without church direction, his trusted position granted him church leaders' support and access to interviews, diaries, journals, memoranda, and other records.<ref name=devotee/>\n\n===Expanded role===\nTurley was appointed Managing Director of the Historical Department in 1989,<ref>[[John K.

These comprise one of the largest collections of [[Mormon history]], [[Western United States|western]] history, and [[genealogy]] in the world.<ref name=newsroombio/> As a person of authority in LDS history and past defender of the church in the Hofmann controversy, Turley later became one of three official LDS Church respondents to a popular 2003 book critical of Mormonism, ''[[Under the Banner of Heaven]]'' by [[Jon Krakauer]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven | date=June 27, 2003 | work=Newsroom | publisher=LDS Church | url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/church-response-to-jon-krakauer-s-under-the-banner-of-heaven | accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Digital projects===\nIn the department, Turley managed several notable electronic projects.

While historical information can be useful, interesting and can provide insights to individuals, I don't think that it's the sure foundation of faith. The sure foundation of faith is spiritual and not physical. ... [T]he more an individual learns about the history of the Church, the greater that individual's understanding will be of the overall picture. Thus, every piece of evidence will be viewed against the total picture. Otherwise, people who do not have much knowledge of Church history may find themselves being tossed to and fro by tidbits from the past.<ref name=devotee/></blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book\n | author        = Turley, Richard E., Jr.\n | title         = Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case\n | publisher     = [[University of Illinois Press]]\n | location      = Urbana, Illinois\n | year          = 1992\n | isbn          = 0-252-01885-0\n | url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=IqrDDrWR_X4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | author1       = \u2014\u2014\n | author2       = Littke, Lael\n | title         = Stories from the Life of Joseph Smith\n | year          = 2003\n | publisher     = [[Deseret Book]]\n | location      = Salt Lake City, Utah\n | isbn          = 1-57008-915-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last1         = Walker\n | first1        = Ronald W.\n | author1-link  = Ronald W.

Bennett]], who served as the school's president from 1928 to 1950. Early in his tenure Dr. Bennett developed a strategic vision for the physical expansion of the university campus. The plan was adopted in 1937 and his vision was followed for more than fifty years, making the university what it is today, including the [[Georgian architecture]] that permeates the campus. The focal point of his vision was a centrally located library building, which became a reality when the [[Edmon Low Library]] opened in 1953. Another major addition to the campus during the Bennett years was the construction of the Student Union, which opened in 1950.

Oklahoma Gov. [[Raymond Gary]] signed the bill authorizing the name change passed by the 26th Oklahoma Legislature on May 15, 1957. However, the bill only authorized the Board of Regents to change the name of the college, a measure they voted on at their meeting on June 6. However, the name was quickly shortened to '''Oklahoma State University''' for most purposes, and the \"Agricultural & Applied Sciences\" name was formally dropped in 1980. Subsequently, the [[Oklahoma State University System]] was created, with the Stillwater campus as the flagship institution and several outlying branches: [[Oklahoma State University - Okmulgee|OSU-Institute of Technology]] in [[Okmulgee, OK|Okmulgee]] (1946), [[Oklahoma State University - Oklahoma City|OSU-Oklahoma City]] (1961), [[Oklahoma State University - Tulsa|OSU-Tulsa]] (1984), and the [[Oklahoma State University - Center for Health Sciences|Center for Health Sciences]] also in [[Tulsa]] (1988).<ref>[http://osu.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=280&Itemid=96 \"OSU History\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901073919/http://osu.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=280&Itemid=96 |date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, OSU announced its \"Campus Master Plan\", a campaign to enhance academic, athletic, and administrative facilities. Over $800 million is ear-marked for campus construction and renovation over twenty years. The Plan calls for an \"athletic village\" where all of the university's athletic facilities will be located on the main campus. To accomplish this goal, the athletic department bought all (or nearly all) the property north of [[Boone Pickens Stadium]] up to McElroy between Knoblock and Washington streets.

Student living was previously dominated by traditional residence halls; however, apartment-style buildings now comprise approximately half of the living quarters.<ref name=\"reslife.okstate.edu\">https://reslife.okstate.edu/housing-options/neighborhoods/</ref> In 2005, the high-rise Willham North and South residence halls that once dominated the Stillwater skyline were demolished and replaced with the Village suites on its site.<ref>https://www.ocolly.com/suites-to-replace-willham-north-and-south/article_27d0ae48-28f1-555e-9f89-c0b562520044.html</ref> Iba Hall, another traditional hall, was closed in 2007, but was reopened in 2011 due to an increase of incoming freshman.<ref>https://www.ocolly.com/iba-hall-closing-after-summer/article_8bc479b0-904a-519d-aeca-d036d007a504.html</ref> In 2017, Iba Hall underwent significant renovations which lasted through most of that year, before reopening in time for the Fall 2018 semester.\n\nIba, Parker, Wentz and Stout Halls continue to offer traditional residence hall accommodations. In addition, three residence halls were opened in the fall of 2015, collectively known as the University Commons. North houses female students, south houses male students, and west is a co-ed facility that also houses the twenty-four-hour service desk for the area. Although Kerr-Drummond was slated to be closed with the opening of the University Commons, Drummond was reopened in fall 2015 due to increased occupancy of campus housing.<ref>https://www.ocolly.com/news/residential-life-announces-closure-of-drummond-hall/article_46b487d2-2703-11e8-9a05-57e2f67ae30e.html</ref> Kerr was closed and is scheduled for demolition in the coming years. Apartments for single students are Bost, Davis, Morsani-Smith, Peterson-Friend, Kamm, Sitlington and Young Halls. Housing in suite-style accommodations are provided in the named Village CASNR (College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources), Village HS (Human Sciences), Village C, Village D, Village E and Village F. Deluxe suites are provided in Patchin & Jones, Bennett, Zink & Allen, and Stinchcomb & Booker Halls.<ref>https://reslife.okstate.edu/housing-options/halls/index.html</ref> Graduate students and families are offered accommodations in seven apartment \"neighborhoods\" with a variety of floor plans and amenities: Brumley, Demaree, Prosser, Stevens, West, and Williams.<ref name=\"reslife.okstate.edu\"/>\n\nAdditionally, a number of learning communities and special interest housing options are available, providing opportunity for students who share interests or majors to live together. Most of these communities occupy certain floors of buildings or halls, rather than consisting of separate buildings. Included among the options are: FIT (Freshman in Transition, College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources), athletic training, career exploration (College of Arts and Sciences), computer science floor, engineering floors, health and sciences floor, HS housing (College of Human and Environmental Sciences), journalism and broadcasting housing, Kamm Leadership House, Ketchum House (Native American interests), James Building (Young Engineers House), Maude's Quad (Women in Engineering House), Recovery House (students recovering from drug and/or alcohol dependence), Spanish House (language immersion), Spears School of Business House, Stout Honors housing (University's Honors Program), Uhuru House (African Centered Cultural House), Wellness House, and The Transfer Zone (transfer students).\n{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Fraternity & Sorority life===\nOklahoma State University's fraternities and sororities celebrated 100 years of existence at OSU in 2008.\n\nSocial fraternities and sororities at Oklahoma State are divided among four councils: Panhellenic, Interfraternity, National Pan-Hellenic and Multicultural.\n\nThirteen national Panhellenic sororities have chapters at OSU.

Bennett]], who served as the school's president from 1928 to 1950. Early in his tenure Dr. Bennett developed a strategic vision for the physical expansion of the university campus. The plan was adopted in 1937 and his vision was followed for more than fifty years, making the university what it is today, including the [[Georgian architecture]] that permeates the campus. The focal point of his vision was a centrally located library building, which became a reality when the [[Edmon Low Library]] opened in 1953. Another major addition to the campus during the Bennett years was the construction of the Student Union, which opened in 1950. Subsequent additions and renovations have made the building one of the largest student union buildings in the world at {{convert|611000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://union.okstate.edu/renovation/BuildingHistory.htm |title=OSU Student Union Building History |publisher=Union.okstate.edu |date=September 9, 1950 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720020635/http://union.okstate.edu/renovation/BuildingHistory.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> A complete renovation and further expansion of the building began in 2010.\n\n[[File:HenryBennettStatueatOSU.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Henry G.

Oklahoma Gov. [[Raymond Gary]] signed the bill authorizing the name change passed by the 26th Oklahoma Legislature on May 15, 1957. However, the bill only authorized the Board of Regents to change the name of the college, a measure they voted on at their meeting on June 6. However, the name was quickly shortened to '''Oklahoma State University''' for most purposes, and the \"Agricultural & Applied Sciences\" name was formally dropped in 1980. Subsequently, the [[Oklahoma State University System]] was created, with the Stillwater campus as the flagship institution and several outlying branches: [[Oklahoma State University - Okmulgee|OSU-Institute of Technology]] in [[Okmulgee, OK|Okmulgee]] (1946), [[Oklahoma State University - Oklahoma City|OSU-Oklahoma City]] (1961), [[Oklahoma State University - Tulsa|OSU-Tulsa]] (1984), and the [[Oklahoma State University - Center for Health Sciences|Center for Health Sciences]] also in [[Tulsa]] (1988).<ref>[http://osu.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=280&Itemid=96 \"OSU History\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901073919/http://osu.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=280&Itemid=96 |date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, OSU announced its \"Campus Master Plan\", a campaign to enhance academic, athletic, and administrative facilities. Over $800 million is ear-marked for campus construction and renovation over twenty years. The Plan calls for an \"athletic village\" where all of the university's athletic facilities will be located on the main campus. To accomplish this goal, the athletic department bought all (or nearly all) the property north of [[Boone Pickens Stadium]] up to McElroy between Knoblock and Washington streets.
