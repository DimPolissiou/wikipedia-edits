For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

New York Times ] October 29, 1966: 1.</ref>)\n\nHamilton then made a science fiction movie for [[George Pal]] at MGM, ''[[The Power (1968 film)|The Power]]'' (1968).\n\n===Television===\nGeorge went into television in 1969, supporting [[Lana Turner]] in the all-star ABC series ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]'' (1969\u201370).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-survivors/cast/204719/|title=The Survivors (1969) Cast| website=TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the show was canceled in January 1970, George went into ''[[Paris 7000]]'' (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

For the next 33 years she travelled around Europe with a touring show from the collection. She married Francois Tussaud in 1795 and took his surname. She renamed her show as Madame Tussaud's. In 1802, she accepted an invitation from [[Paul Philidor]], a [[lantern]] and [[phantasmagoria]] pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nShe was unable to return to France because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], so she traveled throughout [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] exhibiting her collection. From 1831, she took a series of short leases on the upper floor of \"Baker Street Bazaar\" (on the west side of [[Baker Street]], Dorset Street, and King Street).<ref>Pilbeam (2006) pp. 102\u2013106</ref> This site was later featured in the [[Druce-Portland case]] sequence of trials of 1898\u20131907.

Other famous people were added, including [[Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome sculptures still exist that were made by Marie Tussaud herself. The gallery originally contained some 400 different figures, but fire damage in 1925, coupled with [[The Blitz|German bombs in 1941]], severely damaged most of such older models. The casts themselves have survived, allowing the historical waxworks to be remade, and these can be seen in the museum's history exhibit. The oldest figure on display is that of [[Madame du Barry]], the work of Curtius from 1765 and part of the waxworks left to Grosholtz at his death. Other faces from the time of Tussaud include [[Robespierre]] and [[George III of England|George III]]. In 1842, she made a [[self-portrait]], which is now on display at the entrance of her museum.

Until 2010 it incorporated the [[London Planetarium]] in its west wing. A large animated [[dark ride]], ''The Spirit of London'', opened in 1993. Today's wax figures at Tussauds include historical and royal figures, film stars, sports stars, and famous murderers. It has been known since 2007 as \"Madame Tussauds\" museums (no apostrophe).\n\nIn July 2008, Madame Tussauds' Berlin branch became embroiled in controversy when a 41-year-old German man brushed past two guards and decapitated a wax figure depicting [[Adolf Hitler]]. This was believed to be an act of protest against showing the ruthless dictator alongside sports heroes, movie stars, and other historical figures. The statue has since been repaired, and the perpetrator has admitted that he attacked the statue to win a bet.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |title       = Adolf Hitler returns to Berlin museum after beheading\n |publisher   = meeja.com.au\n |date        = 14 September 2008\n |accessdate  = 14 September 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919112006/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |archivedate = 19 September 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The original model of Hitler was unveiled in Madame Tussauds London in April 1933; it was frequently vandalised and a 1936 replacement had to be carefully guarded.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. p. 199.</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|title = Madame Tussauds to repair beheaded Hitler\n|agency = Associated Press\n|date = 7 July 2008\n|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25540602\n|accessdate = 7 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man rips head from Hitler wax figure |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN0547926220080705?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews |agency=[[Reuters]] |first=Paul |last=Carrel |date=5 July 2008}}</ref> In January 2016, the statue of Adolf Hitler was removed from the London museum in response to an open letter sent by a staff writer of ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', followed by significant support for its removal from social media.<ref name=jjmadameremoved>{{cite news|last1=Gur-Arieh|first1=Noga|title=Madame Tussauds Museum in London Removed Hitler Figure|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israelife/item/madame_tussauds_museum_in_london_removed_hitler_figure|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|date=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first Madame Tussauds in India opened in New Delhi on 1 December 2017.

Her mother worked for [[Philippe Curtius]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, who was a physician skilled in wax modeling. Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modelling beginning when she was a child. He moved to Paris and took his young apprentice, then only 6 years old, with him.<ref name=denton>{{cite web|url=https://thelegendsoflondon.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/the-baker-street-bazaar/|title=The Baker Street Bazaar|date=26 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nGrosholtz created her first [[wax sculpture]] in 1777 of [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Du Plessis |first=Amelia |title=England\u2014Madame Tussauds] |url=http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |publisher=Informational site about England |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213062041/http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |archivedate=13 December 2011}}</ref> At the age of 17, she became the art tutor to Madame Elizabeth, the sister of King [[Louis XVI]] of France, at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. During the [[French Revolution]], she was imprisoned for three months and awaiting execution, but was released after the intervention of an influential friend.<ref name=denton/> Other famous people whom she modelled included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

For the next 33 years she travelled around Europe with a touring show from the collection. She married Francois Tussaud in 1795 and took his surname. She renamed her show as Madame Tussaud's. In 1802, she accepted an invitation from [[Paul Philidor]], a [[lantern]] and [[phantasmagoria]] pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nShe was unable to return to France because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], so she traveled throughout [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] exhibiting her collection. From 1831, she took a series of short leases on the upper floor of \"Baker Street Bazaar\" (on the west side of [[Baker Street]], Dorset Street, and King Street).<ref>Pilbeam (2006) pp. 102\u2013106</ref> This site was later featured in the [[Druce-Portland case]] sequence of trials of 1898\u20131907.

Madame Tussauds.com.</ref> One of the main attractions of her museum was the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]]. The name is often credited to a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1845, but Tussaud appears to have originated it herself, using it in advertising as early as 1843.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Berridge\n|first=Kate...But now British actress Emma Watson is already to set and appear here...\n|title=Madame Tussaud: A life in wax\n|location=New York\n|publisher=HarperCollins\n|year=2006\n|isbn=978-0-06-052847-8\n|url=https://archive.org/details/madametussaud00kate\n}}</ref>\n\nThis part of the exhibition included victims of the French Revolution and newly created figures of murderers and other criminals. Other famous people were added, including [[Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome sculptures still exist that were made by Marie Tussaud herself. The gallery originally contained some 400 different figures, but fire damage in 1925, coupled with [[The Blitz|German bombs in 1941]], severely damaged most of such older models. The casts themselves have survived, allowing the historical waxworks to be remade, and these can be seen in the museum's history exhibit. The oldest figure on display is that of [[Madame du Barry]], the work of Curtius from 1765 and part of the waxworks left to Grosholtz at his death. Other faces from the time of Tussaud include [[Robespierre]] and [[George III of England|George III]]. In 1842, she made a [[self-portrait]], which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. She died in her sleep on 16 April 1850.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Bernard Tussaud befejezi Lady Alice Scott \u00e9s a Gloucesteri herceg viasszobr\u00e1t \u2013 London, 1935.10.16.tif|thumb|left|200px|Bernard Tussaud finishes the wax figure of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Scott]] and the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 1935.10.16]]\n\nBy 1883, the restricted space and rising cost of the Baker Street site prompted her grandson Joseph Randall to commission construction of a building at the museum's current location on [[Marylebone Road]]. The new exhibition galleries were opened on 14 July 1884 and were a great success.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. pp. 166, 168\u20139.</ref> But Randall had bought out his cousin Louisa's half share in the business in 1881, and that plus the building costs resulted in his having too little capital.

Until 2010 it incorporated the [[London Planetarium]] in its west wing. A large animated [[dark ride]], ''The Spirit of London'', opened in 1993. Today's wax figures at Tussauds include historical and royal figures, film stars, sports stars, and famous murderers. It has been known since 2007 as \"Madame Tussauds\" museums (no apostrophe).\n\nIn July 2008, Madame Tussauds' Berlin branch became embroiled in controversy when a 41-year-old German man brushed past two guards and decapitated a wax figure depicting [[Adolf Hitler]]. This was believed to be an act of protest against showing the ruthless dictator alongside sports heroes, movie stars, and other historical figures. The statue has since been repaired, and the perpetrator has admitted that he attacked the statue to win a bet.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |title       = Adolf Hitler returns to Berlin museum after beheading\n |publisher   = meeja.com.au\n |date        = 14 September 2008\n |accessdate  = 14 September 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919112006/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |archivedate = 19 September 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The original model of Hitler was unveiled in Madame Tussauds London in April 1933; it was frequently vandalised and a 1936 replacement had to be carefully guarded.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. p. 199.</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|title = Madame Tussauds to repair beheaded Hitler\n|agency = Associated Press\n|date = 7 July 2008\n|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25540602\n|accessdate = 7 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man rips head from Hitler wax figure |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN0547926220080705?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews |agency=[[Reuters]] |first=Paul |last=Carrel |date=5 July 2008}}</ref> In January 2016, the statue of Adolf Hitler was removed from the London museum in response to an open letter sent by a staff writer of ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', followed by significant support for its removal from social media.<ref name=jjmadameremoved>{{cite news|last1=Gur-Arieh|first1=Noga|title=Madame Tussauds Museum in London Removed Hitler Figure|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israelife/item/madame_tussauds_museum_in_london_removed_hitler_figure|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|date=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first Madame Tussauds in India opened in New Delhi on 1 December 2017.

Due to privilege regarding race and color, mulattoes on the plantation were given more respectable jobs where as the Edmonson's  mainly worked in the corn fields and handled livestock. The Edmondson family worked on the plantation and earned a mere 12 dollars a month. During these times in the corn fields he would see \"angels in the clouds\" and believe it was God talking to him. <ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson had little or no formal education. \n\n\nWhen his father died in late 1889, 16-year-old Edmondson refused to continue to tirelessly work on the plantation and left to Nashville for work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He got a good job working at the expansive new [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad]] shops. After an injury sustained at the Railway shops in 1907, Edmondson took a job as a custodian at the Nashville Women's Hospital, where he worked until the hospital closed in 1931.<ref name=\":2\" /> During this time, the Edmondson family officially resided in Nashville as his mother, Jane, was the last to leave the Compton Plantation. By age 39, his wages at Women's Hospital allowed him to buy a modest home and spacious lot in Edgehill, a segregated neighborhood in Nashville's Vanderbilt-Belmont area.<ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson never married and he shared the home with his mother and sister, as well as, occasionally, other siblings, nieces, and nephews. With Jane's passing in 1922, Edmonson's sister, Sarah, soon became the woman of the house. It was said she would often hold family barbecues that consisted of laughter and storytelling.<ref name=\":1\" />  When the hospital closed in 1931, Edmondson picked up work at various part-time jobs and in his leisure, he could be found in his backyard sculpting and selling his vegetables.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\nIn 1948 Edmondson stopped sculpting. On February 7, 1951 at age seventy-six, he passed quietly in his home in Nashville, Tennessee, where illness had confined him to bed for several months. As he was the last of his siblings to pass, his five nieces and seven nephews carried out his funeral service which was held the next day<ref name=\":1\" />. William Edmondson was buried in Mount Ararat Cemetery, now [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)]], Nashville's oldest black cemetery. Today there is no sign of Edmondson's grave marker because at the time cheap wooden caskets were used to bury African Americans. As the wood decayed it would cause the grave markers to sink into the earth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mt. Ararat burial records of the period were lost in a fire, so his exact grave site is unknown.\n\n== Art career ==\n[[File:Crucifix_ca._1932-1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|369x369px|\"Crucifixion\" ca. 1932\u201337, carved limestone, gift from Elizabeth Gibbons-Hanson]]\nEdmondson entered the world of sculpture at the advanced age of about 60 years old in 1934. He reported that he received a vision from God, who told him to start sculpting: \"I was out in the driveway with some old sculptures of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make. I knowed it was God telling me what to do.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Jack|first=Lindsey|title=Miracles : the sculptures of William Edmondson.|last2=Pa.)|first2=Janet Fleisher Gallery (Philadelphia|isbn=0962150630|oclc=32664611}}</ref> He carved tombstones primarily from chunks of discarded limestone from demolished buildings, which were delivered to him by wrecking companies' trucks. A signature Edmondson tombstone reflects strong large lettering carved in the stone<ref name=\":1\" />. He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures. In his yard hung a sign \"Tomb-Stones. For Sale. Garden. Ornaments. Stone Work W M Edmondson\". <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Spires|first=Elizabeth|title=I Hear God Talking to Me|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2009|isbn=9780374335281|location=New York|pages=50-52}}</ref> \n\nEdmondson's work was influenced by his [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and his membership in a nearby [[Primitive Baptist]] congregation. His sculptures are straightforward and emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height, many sharing his unique religious symbolism. He carved figures of biblical characters, angels, doves, turtles, eagles, rabbits, horses and other real and fanciful creatures. His sculpture ''Noah's Ark'' stood tall in the middle of his backyard. It consists for four differently carved tiers of limestone and is the only architectural work that existed in his collection.<ref name=\":1\" />, He carved local community icons such as preachers, lawyers and school teachers, celebrities of the day who were important to the [[African American]] community, such as prizefighter [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio/william-edmondson/|title=WILLIAM EDMONDSON|work=Ricco Maresca Gallery|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> He also sculpted a number of popular figures such as First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Edmondson also created and a small number of nude figures.<ref>''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.70</ref> Most of Edmonson's carved figures consisted of faces carved on a spherical base, with a small mouth resting directly under a vertical nose, following to connect to the curve of the brow.

Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery. \n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels.

Due to privilege regarding race and color, mulattoes on the plantation were given more respectable jobs where as the Edmonson's  mainly worked in the corn fields and handled livestock. The Edmondson family worked on the plantation and earned a mere 12 dollars a month. During these times in the corn fields he would see \"angels in the clouds\" and believe it was God talking to him. <ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson had little or no formal education. \n\n\nWhen his father died in late 1889, 16-year-old Edmondson refused to continue to tirelessly work on the plantation and left to Nashville for work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He got a good job working at the expansive new [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad]] shops. After an injury sustained at the Railway shops in 1907, Edmondson took a job as a custodian at the Nashville Women's Hospital, where he worked until the hospital closed in 1931.<ref name=\":2\" /> During this time, the Edmondson family officially resided in Nashville as his mother, Jane, was the last to leave the Compton Plantation. By age 39, his wages at Women's Hospital allowed him to buy a modest home and spacious lot in Edgehill, a segregated neighborhood in Nashville's Vanderbilt-Belmont area.<ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson never married and he shared the home with his mother and sister, as well as, occasionally, other siblings, nieces, and nephews. With Jane's passing in 1922, Edmonson's sister, Sarah, soon became the woman of the house. It was said she would often hold family barbecues that consisted of laughter and storytelling.<ref name=\":1\" />  When the hospital closed in 1931, Edmondson picked up work at various part-time jobs and in his leisure, he could be found in his backyard sculpting and selling his vegetables.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\nIn 1948 Edmondson stopped sculpting. On February 7th, 1951 at age seventy-six, he passed quietly in his home in Nashville, Tennessee, where illness had confined him to bed for several months. As he was the last of his siblings to pass, his five nieces and seven nephews carried out his funeral service which was held the next day<ref name=\":1\" />. William Edmondson was buried in Mount Ararat Cemetery, now [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)]], Nashville's oldest black cemetery. Today there is no sign of Edmondson's grave marker because at the time cheap wooden caskets were used to bury African Americans. As the wood decayed it would cause the grave markers to sink into the earth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mt. Ararat burial records of the period were lost in a fire, so his exact grave site is unknown.\n\n== Art career ==\n[[File:Crucifix_ca._1932-1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|369x369px|\"Crucifixion\" ca. 1932\u201337, carved limestone, gift from Elizabeth Gibbons-Hanson]]\nEdmondson entered the world of sculpture at the advanced age of about 60 years old in 1934. He reported that he received a vision from God, who told him to start sculpting: \"I was out in the driveway with some old sculptures of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make.

A signature Edmondson tombstone reflects strong large lettering carved in the stone<ref name=\":1\" />. He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures.

His sculptures are straightforward and emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height, many sharing his unique religious symbolism. He carved figures of biblical characters, angels, doves, turtles, eagles, rabbits, horses and other real and fanciful creatures. His sculpture ''Noah's Ark'' stood tall in the middle of his backyard. It consists for four differently carved tiers of limestone and is the only architectural work that existed in his collection.<ref name=\":1\" />, He carved local community icons such as preachers, lawyers and school teachers, celebrities of the day who were important to the [[African American]] community, such as prizefighter [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio/william-edmondson/|title=WILLIAM EDMONDSON|work=Ricco Maresca Gallery|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> He also sculpted a number of popular figures such as First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Edmondson also created and a small number of nude figures.<ref>''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed.
