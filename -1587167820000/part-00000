Two [[Roman legion|legions]] were deployed in the [[imperial province]] of '''\u00c6gyptus''' (Egypt) in the year 125.\n}}\nAs a key province, but also the 'crown domain' where the emperors succeeded the divine [[Pharaoh]]s, Egypt was ruled by a uniquely styled [[Praefectus augustalis]] ('Augustal prefect'), instead of the traditional senatorial governor of other [[Roman provinces]]. The prefect was a man of [[equestrian rank]] and was appointed by the Emperor. The first prefect of Aegyptus, [[Gaius Cornelius Gallus]], brought Upper Egypt under Roman control by force of arms, and established a [[protectorate]] over the southern frontier district, which had been abandoned by the later Ptolemies.\n\nThe second prefect, [[Aelius Gallus]], made an unsuccessful expedition to conquer [[Arabia Petraea]] and even [[Arabia Felix]]. The [[Red Sea]] coast of Aegyptus was not brought under Roman control until the reign of [[Claudius]]. The third prefect, [[Gaius Petronius]], cleared the neglected canals for irrigation, stimulating a revival of agriculture. Petronius even led a campaign into present-day central [[Sudan]] against the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]], whose [[Kandake|queen]] [[Amanirenas|Imanarenat]] had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains, in 22 BC he razed the city of [[Napata]] to the ground and retreated to the north.\n\nFrom the reign of [[Nero]] onward, Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the [[Jew]]s, particularly in [[Alexandria]], which after the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture. Under [[Trajan]] a [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]] occurred, resulting in the suppression of the Jews of Alexandria and the loss of all their privileges, although they soon returned. [[Hadrian]], who twice visited Aegyptus, founded [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] in memory of his drowned lover [[Antinous]]. From his reign onward buildings in the Greco-Roman style were erected throughout the country.\n\nUnder [[Antoninus Pius]] oppressive taxation led to a revolt in 139, of the native [[Egyptians]], which was suppressed only after several years of fighting. This Bucolic War, led by one [[Isidorus]], caused great damage to the economy and marked the beginning of Egypt's economic decline. [[Avidius Cassius]], who led the Roman forces in the war, declared himself emperor in 175, and was acknowledged by the armies of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and Aegyptus.\n\nOn the approach of Marcus Aurelius, Cassius was deposed and killed and the clemency of the emperor restored peace. A similar revolt broke out in 193, when [[Pescennius Niger]] was proclaimed emperor on the death of [[Pertinax]]. The Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] gave a constitution to Alexandria and the provincial capitals in 202.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Caracalla]] (211\u2013217) granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians, in common with the other provincials, but this was mainly to extort more taxes, which grew increasingly onerous as the needs of the emperors for more revenue grew more desperate.\n\nThere was a series of revolts, both military and civilian, through the 3rd century. Under [[Decius]], in 250, the Christians again suffered from persecution, but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260, [[Mussius Aemilianus]], first supported the [[Macriani (disambiguation)|Macriani]], [[Gallienus usurpers|usurpers during the rule of Gallienus]], and later, in 261, became a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] himself, but was defeated by Gallienus.\n\n[[Zenobia]], queen of [[Palmyra]], took the country away from the Romans when she conquered Aegyptus in 269, declaring herself the Queen of [[Egypt]] also. This warrior queen claimed that Egypt was an ancestral home of hers through a familial tie to [[Cleopatra VII]]. She was well educated and familiar with the culture of Egypt, its religion, and its language. She lost it later when the Roman emperor, [[Aurelian]], severed amicable relations between the two countries and retook Egypt in 274.\n\nTwo generals based in Aegyptus, [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] and [[Domitius Domitianus]], led successful revolts and made themselves emperors. [[Diocletian]] captured Alexandria from Domitius in 298 and reorganised the whole province. His edict of 303 against the Christians began a new era of persecution. This was the last serious attempt to stem the steady growth of Christianity in Egypt, however.\n\n== Roman government in Egypt ==\n{{Further|List of governors of Roman Egypt}}\n\nAs Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt, they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept, some were changed, and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] introduced important changes in the administrative system, aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing [[revenue]]. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], for the organization of finance and taxation, and for the administration of justice.\n\nThe reforms of the early 4th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in [[Egypt|Aegyptus]], at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces, and separate civil and military officials were established; the [[praeses]] and the [[dux]]. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient (i.e. the vicar) of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria.\n\nEmperor Justinian abolished the diocese of Egypt in 538 and re-combined civil and military power in the hands of the [[dux]] with a civil deputy (the praeses) as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local [[autonomy]] had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable, its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|450px|[[Indo-Roman trade and relations|Roman trade with India]] started from Aegyptus according to the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] (1st century).]]\nThe economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the [[Ptolemaic period]], but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated [[tax|taxation system]] was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land, and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash, as well as customs dues and the like, was collected by appointed officials.\n\nA massive amount of Aegyptus's grain was shipped downriver (north) both to feed the population of [[Alexandria]] and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers.\n\nThe Roman government had actively encouraged the [[privatization]] of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture, commerce, and trade, and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of state-owned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords, and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals, which tended to remain at a fairly high level.\n\nOverall, the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy, even at the [[village]] level, was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and, in the towns and the larger villages, a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade, both internal and external, reached its peak in the 1st and 2nd centuries.\n\nBy the end of the 3rd century, major problems were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage,<ref>{{cite book |first=Erik |last=Christiansen |title=Coinage in Roman Egypt: The Hoard Evidence |location= |publisher=Aarhus University Press |year=2004 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VkVmAAAAMAAJ }} }}</ref> and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channeled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the [[Committee|councils]] was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]].\n\n== Military ==\nThis wealthiest of provinces could be held militarily by a very small force; and the threat implicit in an embargo on the export of grain supplies, vital to the provisioning of the city of Rome and its populace, was obvious. Internal security was guaranteed by the presence of three Roman legions (later reduced to two, then one [[Legio II Traiana]]) stationed at the grand capital Alexandria. Each of these numbered around 5000 strong, and several units of auxiliaries.\n\nIn the first decade of Roman rule the spirit of Augustan imperialism looked farther afield, attempting expansion to the east and to the south. Most of the early Roman troops stationed there were Greco-Macedonians and native Egyptians once part of the dissolved Ptolemaic army finding service for Rome. Eventually Romans or Romanized people were a majority.\n\n== Social structure in early Roman Egypt ==\n{{See also|Fayum mummy portraits}}\n[[File:Egyptian - Mummy Portrait of a Man - Walters 323.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Citizen of Roman Egypt ([[Fayum mummy portrait]])]]\n[[File:Bust of Roman Nobleman, ca. 30 B.C.E.\u2013 50 C.E., 54.51.jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Roman Nobleman, c. 30 BC\u201350 AD, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Egipto Hadrianeum.JPG|right|thumb|Possible depiction of the province of Egypt from the Hadrianeum in Rome]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Octavian Karnak.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Augustus]] wearing the [[nemes]] like Egyptian pharaohs.]] -->\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand, the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time, the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as \u201cEgyptians\u201d, an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected.<ref name=\"Oxyrhynchus and Rome, p.3\">{{cite journal |first=E.

Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 4th century.  One element in particular was the appointment of [[strategoi]] to govern the \u2018[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]s\u2019, the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt.  [[Boulai]], or town councils, in Egypt were only formally constituted by [[Septimius Severus]].  It was only under [[Diocletian]] later in the 3rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service, which was based on ''poros'' (property or income qualification), which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied, but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of metropolises.<ref>Lewis, p.141</ref> The city of [[Oxyrhynchus]] had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities.  This city, along with Alexandria, shows the diverse set-up of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt.\n\nJust as under the Ptolemies, Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies, the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a [[deme]] that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with \u201c[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]]\u201d landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more self-administration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry, there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 4\u20135 AD.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\">{{cite journal |first=E.

There was also the council of elders known as the [[gerousia]]. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and well-educated administrators.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\" /> These elites also paid lower poll-taxes than the local native Egyptians, [[fellahin]]. It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were able to enjoy lower tax-rates on land.<ref>{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Delia |title=Alexandrian Citizenship During the Roman Principate |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |year=1991 |page=31 }}</ref>\n\nThese privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians, on the other hand, had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod.<ref>Delia, pp.31\u201332</ref> Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt, it is clear that the other Greek cities, such as Antinoopolis, enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria.<ref>Delia, p.32</ref>  All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.\n\nThe Gnomon of the Idios Logos shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with, mainly fines and confiscation of property, to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former master's social status. The Gnomon demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property.\n\n== Christian Egypt (33 AD\u20134th century) ==\n{{anchor|Christian Egypt}}\n{{History of Egypt}}\n\nThe [[patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchate of Alexandria]] is traditionally held to be founded by [[Mark the Evangelist]] around 42. Evidence for a bishopric before the third century is however slight given the importance of the city's presbyters. Bishops often named their successors (e.g. Peter, his brother, by Athanasius in 373) or the succession was effected by imposing the hands of a deceased bishop on the one chosen to follow him. \n\nBy 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian [[apologist]]s [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]] both lived part or all of their lives in that city, where they wrote, taught, and debated.\n\nWith the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 5th century, paganism was suppressed and lost its following, as the poet [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] bitterly noted. It lingered underground for many decades: the final edict against paganism was issued in 435, but graffiti at [[Philae]] in Upper Egypt proves worship of [[Isis]] persisted at its temples into the 6th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians, but many others refused to do so, leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country.\n\nNo sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world, between the [[Arianism|Arians]], named for the Alexandrian priest [[Arius]], and their opponents, represented by [[Athanasius]], who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the [[First Council of Nicaea]] rejected Arius's views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 4th century. In the course of one of these, the great [[Serapeum#Destruction of the Alexandrian Serapeum|temple of Serapis]], the stronghold of paganism, was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times.\n\nPatristic authorship was dominated by Egyptian contributions: Athanasius, Didymus the Blind and Cyril, and the power of the Alexandrian see embodied in Athanasius, Theophilus,  his nephew, Cyril and shortly by Dioscuros.\n\nEgypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation, enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish, but other doctrines, such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Manichaeism]], either native or imported, found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the [[monasticism]] of the [[Desert Fathers]], who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church.\n\nEgyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor [[Valens]] had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts, the so-called [[Greek Magical Papyri]]. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day.\n\nChristianity was quickly accepted by the people who were oppressed in first-century Roman Egypt. Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Since Christianity blended with local traditions it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries. Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries, Christianity spread out to Nubia. <ref>History of Africa written by Kevin Shillington</ref>\n\n== Later Roman Egypt (4th\u20136th centuries) ==\n[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the Near East in 565, showing Byzantine Egypt and its neighbors.]]\n{{further|Diocese of Egypt}}\n\nThe reign of Constantine also saw the founding of [[Constantinople]] as a new capital for the Roman Empire, and in the course of the 4th century the Empire was divided in two, with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin, never well established in Egypt, would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 5th and 6th centuries the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], known historiographically as the [[Byzantine Empire]], gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past.\n\nThe [[Fall of Rome|fall of the Western Empire]] in the 5th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Rome's culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The triumph of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions: with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples, no-one could read the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] of Pharaonic Egypt, and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.\n\nThe Eastern Empire became increasingly \"oriental\" in style as its links with the old Gr\u00e6co-Roman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices, with new Byzantine names, were almost hereditary in the wealthy land-owning families. Alexandria, the second city of the empire, continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence.\n\n[[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], the [[patriarch of Alexandria]], convinced the city's governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob, in response to the Jews' alleged night-time massacre of many Christians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The murder of the philosopher [[Hypatia]] in March 415 marked a dramatic turn in classical Hellenic culture in Egypt but philosophy thrived in sixth century Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another schism in the Church produced prolonged disturbances  and may have alienated Egypt from the Empire. The countless [[papyrus]] finds mark the continuance of Greek culture and institutions at various levels.\n\nThe new religious controversy was over the [[Christ]]'s human and divine nature. The issue was whether He had two natures, human and divine, or a combined one ([[hypostatic union]] from His humanity and divinity).  In an intensely religious age it was enough to divide an empire. The [[Miaphysite]] controversy arose after the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381 and continued until well after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, which ruled in favour of the position that Christ was \"one person in two natures\" as opposed to Monophysitism (a single nature).\n\n Monophysite belief was not held by the 'miaphysites' as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called, the \"Incarnate Logos of God\". Many of the 'miaphysites' claimed that they were misunderstood, that there was really no difference between their position and the Chalcedonian position, and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue, creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today.<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=2011-12-20 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire\"</ref> Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment, and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 570s.\n\nEgypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (527&ndash;565) saw the Empire recapture [[Rome]] and much of [[Italy]] from the barbarians, but these successes left the empire's eastern flank exposed.

From 619 - 628, [[Sasanian Egypt|they incorporated Egypt once again within their territories]], the previous (much longer) time being under the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Achaemenids]]. [[Khosrow II]] Parv\u00eaz had begun [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628|this war]] in retaliation for the assassination of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582\u2013602) and had achieved a series of early successes, culminating in the conquests of [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|Jerusalem]] (614) and [[Siege of Alexandria (619)|Alexandria]] (619).\n\nA Byzantine counteroffensive launched by Emperor [[Heraclius]] in the spring of 622 shifted the advantage, and the war was brought to an end by the fall of Khosrow on 25 February 628 <ref>Frye, pp.&nbsp;167\u201370{{full|date=July 2019}}</ref>. The Egyptians had no love of the emperor in Constantinople and put up little resistance. Khosrow's son and successor, [[Kavadh II]] \u0160\u00ear\u00f4e (\u0160\u00ear\u00f4y), who reigned until September, concluded a peace treaty returning territories conquered by the Sassanids to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].\n\nThe Persian conquest allowed [[Miaphysitism]] to resurface in the open in Egypt, and when imperial rule was restored by Emperor Heraclius in 629, the Miaphysites were persecuted and their patriarch expelled. Egypt was thus in a state of both religious and political alienation from the Empire when a new invader appeared.\n\n== Arab Islamic conquest (639\u2013646 AD) ==\n[[File:Byzantiumby650AD.svg|thumb|450px|The Mediterranean world in 650, after the Arabs had conquered Egypt and Syria from the Byzantines.]]\n{{Main|Muslim conquest of Egypt}}\n\nAn army of 4,000 [[Arabs]] led by [[Amr Ibn Al-Aas]] was sent by the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], successor to [[Muhammad]](PBUH), to spread Islamic rule to the west. Arabs crossed into Egypt from Palestine in December 639, and advanced rapidly into the [[Nile Delta]]. The Imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more.\n\nThe Arabs sent for reinforcements, and in April 641 they [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|besieged and captured Alexandria]]. The Byzantines assembled a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt, and won back [[Alexandria]] in 645. The Muslims retook the city in 646, completing the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]. 40,000 civilians were evacuated to Constantinople with the imperial fleet. Thus ended 975 years of [[Greco-Roman]] rule over Egypt.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mummy Mask of a Man, early 1st century C.E.,72.57.jpg|Mummy Mask of a Man, early 1st century AD, 72.57, [[Brooklyn Museum]]\nFile:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|[[Death mask|Funerary masks]] uncovered in [[Faiyum]], 1st century.\nFile:As-Hadrian-Aegyptus-RIC 0839,As.jpg|[[Hadrian]] coin celebrating \u00c6gyptus Province, struck c. 135.

Petronius even led a campaign into present-day central [[Sudan]] against the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]], whose [[Kandake|queen]] [[Amanirenas|Imanarenat]] had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains, in 22 BC he razed the city of [[Napata]] to the ground and retreated to the north.\n\nFrom the reign of [[Nero]] onward, Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the [[Jew]]s, particularly in [[Alexandria]], which after the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture. Under [[Trajan]] a [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]] occurred, resulting in the suppression of the Jews of Alexandria and the loss of all their privileges, although they soon returned. [[Hadrian]], who twice visited Aegyptus, founded [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] in memory of his drowned lover [[Antinous]]. From his reign onward buildings in the Greco-Roman style were erected throughout the country.\n\nUnder [[Antoninus Pius]] oppressive taxation led to a revolt in 139, of the native [[Egyptians]], which was suppressed only after several years of fighting. This Bucolic War, led by one [[Isidorus]], caused great damage to the economy and marked the beginning of Egypt's economic decline. [[Avidius Cassius]], who led the Roman forces in the war, declared himself emperor in 175, and was acknowledged by the armies of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and Aegyptus.\n\nOn the approach of Marcus Aurelius, Cassius was deposed and killed and the clemency of the emperor restored peace. A similar revolt broke out in 193, when [[Pescennius Niger]] was proclaimed emperor on the death of [[Pertinax]]. The Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] gave a constitution to Alexandria and the provincial capitals in 202.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Caracalla]] (211\u2013217) granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians, in common with the other provincials, but this was mainly to extort more taxes, which grew increasingly onerous as the needs of the emperors for more revenue grew more desperate.\n\nThere was a series of revolts, both military and civilian, through the 3rd century. Under [[Decius]], in 250, the Christians again suffered from persecution, but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260, [[Mussius Aemilianus]], first supported the [[Macriani (disambiguation)|Macriani]], [[Gallienus usurpers|usurpers during the rule of Gallienus]], and later, in 261, became a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] himself, but was defeated by Gallienus.\n\n[[Zenobia]], queen of [[Palmyra]], took the country away from the Romans when she conquered Aegyptus in 269, declaring herself the Queen of [[Egypt]] also. This warrior queen claimed that Egypt was an ancestral home of hers through a familial tie to [[Cleopatra VII]]. She was well educated and familiar with the culture of Egypt, its religion, and its language. She lost it later when the Roman emperor, [[Aurelian]], severed amicable relations between the two countries and retook Egypt in 274.\n\nTwo generals based in Aegyptus, [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] and [[Domitius Domitianus]], led successful revolts and made themselves emperors. [[Diocletian]] captured Alexandria from Domitius in 298 and reorganised the whole province. His edict of 303 against the Christians began a new era of persecution. This was the last serious attempt to stem the steady growth of Christianity in Egypt, however.\n\n== Roman government in Egypt ==\n{{Further|List of governors of Roman Egypt}}\n\nAs Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt, they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept, some were changed, and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] introduced important changes in the administrative system, aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing [[revenue]]. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], for the organization of finance and taxation, and for the administration of justice.\n\nThe reforms of the early 4th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in [[Egypt|Aegyptus]], at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces, and separate civil and military officials were established; the [[praeses]] and the [[dux]]. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient (i.e. the vicar) of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria.\n\nEmperor Justinian abolished the diocese of Egypt in 538 and re-combined civil and military power in the hands of the [[dux]] with a civil deputy (the praeses) as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local [[autonomy]] had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable, its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|450px|[[Indo-Roman trade and relations|Roman trade with India]] started from Aegyptus according to the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] (1st century).]]\nThe economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the [[Ptolemaic period]], but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated [[tax|taxation system]] was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land, and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash, as well as customs dues and the like, was collected by appointed officials.\n\nA massive amount of Aegyptus's grain was shipped downriver (north) both to feed the population of [[Alexandria]] and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers.\n\nThe Roman government had actively encouraged the [[privatization]] of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture, commerce, and trade, and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of state-owned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords, and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals, which tended to remain at a fairly high level.\n\nOverall, the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy, even at the [[village]] level, was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and, in the towns and the larger villages, a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade, both internal and external, reached its peak in the 1st and 2nd centuries.\n\nBy the end of the 3rd century, major problems were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage,<ref>{{cite book |first=Erik |last=Christiansen |title=Coinage in Roman Egypt: The Hoard Evidence |location= |publisher=Aarhus University Press |year=2004 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VkVmAAAAMAAJ }} }}</ref> and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channeled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the [[Committee|councils]] was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]].\n\n== Military ==\nThis wealthiest of provinces could be held militarily by a very small force; and the threat implicit in an embargo on the export of grain supplies, vital to the provisioning of the city of Rome and its populace, was obvious. Internal security was guaranteed by the presence of three Roman legions (later reduced to two, then one [[Legio II Traiana]]) stationed at the grand capital Alexandria. Each of these numbered around 5000 strong, and several units of auxiliaries.\n\nIn the first decade of Roman rule the spirit of Augustan imperialism looked farther afield, attempting expansion to the east and to the south. Most of the early Roman troops stationed there were Greco-Macedonians and native Egyptians once part of the dissolved Ptolemaic army finding service for Rome. Eventually Romans or Romanized people were a majority.\n\n== Social structure in early Roman Egypt ==\n{{See also|Fayum mummy portraits}}\n[[File:Egyptian - Mummy Portrait of a Man - Walters 323.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Citizen of Roman Egypt ([[Fayum mummy portrait]])]]\n[[File:Bust of Roman Nobleman, ca. 30 B.C.E.\u2013 50 C.E., 54.51.jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Roman Nobleman, c. 30 BC\u201350 AD, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Egipto Hadrianeum.JPG|right|thumb|Possible depiction of the province of Egypt from the Hadrianeum in Rome]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Octavian Karnak.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Augustus]] wearing the [[nemes]] like Egyptian pharaohs.]] -->\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand, the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time, the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as \u201cEgyptians\u201d, an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected.<ref name=\"Oxyrhynchus and Rome, p.3\">{{cite journal |first=E.

Other than Roman citizens, a Greek citizen of one of the Greek cities had the highest status, and a rural Egyptian would be in the lowest class.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Alston |title=Philo's In Flaccum: Ethnicity and Social Space in Roman Alexandria |journal=Greece and Rome |series=Second Series |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=165\u2013175 [p. 166] |doi=10.1093/gr/44.2.165 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/958c32b3dd2c4b85c4c217ca9b9762fa7510e26a }}</ref> In between those classes was the metropolite, who was almost certainly of Hellenic origin.

Although only Roman citizens could serve in the legions, many Greeks found their way in. The native Egyptians could join the auxiliary forces and attain citizenship upon discharge.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Idris H. |last=Bell |title=Hellenic Culture in Egypt |journal=[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]] |volume=8 |issue=3/4 |year=1922 |pages=139\u2013155 [p. 148] |jstor=3853691 |doi=10.2307/3853691 }}</ref> The different groups had different rates of taxation based on their social class. The Greeks were exempt from the [[Tax per head|poll tax]], while Hellenized inhabitants of the nome capitals were taxed at a lower rate than the native Egyptians, who could not enter the army, and paid the full poll tax.<ref>Bell, p.148</ref>\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus is very closely linked to the governing administration. Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 4th century.  One element in particular was the appointment of [[strategoi]] to govern the \u2018[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]s\u2019, the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt.  [[Boulai]], or town councils, in Egypt were only formally constituted by [[Septimius Severus]].  It was only under [[Diocletian]] later in the 3rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service, which was based on ''poros'' (property or income qualification), which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied, but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of metropolises.<ref>Lewis, p.141</ref> The city of [[Oxyrhynchus]] had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities.  This city, along with Alexandria, shows the diverse set-up of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt.\n\nJust as under the Ptolemies, Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies, the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a [[deme]] that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |first=A. N. |last=Sherwin-White |title=The Roman Citizenship |url=https://archive.org/details/romancitizenship0000sher |url-access=registration |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/romancitizenship0000sher/page/391 391] |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIf a common Egyptian wanted to become a Roman citizen he would first have to become an Alexandrian citizen. The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with \u201c[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]]\u201d landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more self-administration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry, there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 4\u20135 AD.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\">{{cite journal |first=E. G. |last=Turner |title=Roman Oxyrhynchus |journal=[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]] |volume=38 |issue= |pages=78\u201393 [p. 84] |jstor=3855498 |year=1952 |doi=10.1177/030751335203800110 }}</ref>\n\nThe candidate for the gymnasium would then be let into the [[ephebus]]. There was also the council of elders known as the [[gerousia]]. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and well-educated administrators.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\" /> These elites also paid lower poll-taxes than the local native Egyptians, [[fellahin]]. It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were able to enjoy lower tax-rates on land.<ref>{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Delia |title=Alexandrian Citizenship During the Roman Principate |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |year=1991 |page=31 }}</ref>\n\nThese privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians, on the other hand, had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod.<ref>Delia, pp.31\u201332</ref> Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt, it is clear that the other Greek cities, such as Antinoopolis, enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria.<ref>Delia, p.32</ref>  All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.\n\nThe Gnomon of the Idios Logos shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with, mainly fines and confiscation of property, to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former master's social status. The Gnomon demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property.\n\n== Christian Egypt (33 AD\u20134th century) ==\n{{anchor|Christian Egypt}}\n{{History of Egypt}}\n\nThe [[patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchate of Alexandria]] is traditionally held to be founded by [[Mark the Evangelist]] around 42. Evidence for a bishopric before the third century is however slight given the importance of the city's presbyters. Bishops often named their successors (e.g. Peter, his brother, by Athanasius in 373) or the succession was effected by imposing the hands of a deceased bishop on the one chosen to follow him. \n\nBy 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian [[apologist]]s [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]] both lived part or all of their lives in that city, where they wrote, taught, and debated.\n\nWith the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 5th century, paganism was suppressed and lost its following, as the poet [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] bitterly noted. It lingered underground for many decades: the final edict against paganism was issued in 435, but graffiti at [[Philae]] in Upper Egypt proves worship of [[Isis]] persisted at its temples into the 6th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians, but many others refused to do so, leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country.\n\nNo sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world, between the [[Arianism|Arians]], named for the Alexandrian priest [[Arius]], and their opponents, represented by [[Athanasius]], who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the [[First Council of Nicaea]] rejected Arius's views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 4th century. In the course of one of these, the great [[Serapeum#Destruction of the Alexandrian Serapeum|temple of Serapis]], the stronghold of paganism, was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times.\n\nPatristic authorship was dominated by Egyptian contributions: Athanasius, Didymus the Blind and Cyril, and the power of the Alexandrian see embodied in Athanasius, Theophilus,  his nephew, Cyril and shortly by Dioscuros.\n\nEgypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation, enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish, but other doctrines, such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Manichaeism]], either native or imported, found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the [[monasticism]] of the [[Desert Fathers]], who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church.\n\nEgyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor [[Valens]] had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts, the so-called [[Greek Magical Papyri]]. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day.\n\nChristianity was quickly accepted by the people who were oppressed in first-century Roman Egypt. Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Since Christianity blended with local traditions it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries. Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries, Christianity spread out to Nubia. <ref>History of Africa written by Kevin Shillington</ref>\n\n== Later Roman Egypt (4th\u20136th centuries) ==\n[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the Near East in 565, showing Byzantine Egypt and its neighbors.]]\n{{further|Diocese of Egypt}}\n\nThe reign of Constantine also saw the founding of [[Constantinople]] as a new capital for the Roman Empire, and in the course of the 4th century the Empire was divided in two, with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin, never well established in Egypt, would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 5th and 6th centuries the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], known historiographically as the [[Byzantine Empire]], gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past.\n\nThe [[Fall of Rome|fall of the Western Empire]] in the 5th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Rome's culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The triumph of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions: with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples, no-one could read the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] of Pharaonic Egypt, and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.\n\nThe Eastern Empire became increasingly \"oriental\" in style as its links with the old Gr\u00e6co-Roman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices, with new Byzantine names, were almost hereditary in the wealthy land-owning families. Alexandria, the second city of the empire, continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence.\n\n[[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], the [[patriarch of Alexandria]], convinced the city's governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob, in response to the Jews' alleged night-time massacre of many Christians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The murder of the philosopher [[Hypatia]] in March 415 marked a dramatic turn in classical Hellenic culture in Egypt but philosophy thrived in sixth century Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another schism in the Church produced prolonged disturbances  and may have alienated Egypt from the Empire. The countless [[papyrus]] finds mark the continuance of Greek culture and institutions at various levels.\n\nThe new religious controversy was over the [[Christ]]'s human and divine nature. The issue was whether He had two natures, human and divine, or a combined one ([[hypostatic union]] from His humanity and divinity).  In an intensely religious age it was enough to divide an empire. The [[Miaphysite]] controversy arose after the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381 and continued until well after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, which ruled in favour of the position that Christ was \"one person in two natures\" as opposed to Monophysitism (a single nature).\n\n Monophysite belief was not held by the 'miaphysites' as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called, the \"Incarnate Logos of God\". Many of the 'miaphysites' claimed that they were misunderstood, that there was really no difference between their position and the Chalcedonian position, and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue, creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today.<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=2011-12-20 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire\"</ref> Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment, and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 570s.\n\nEgypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (527&ndash;565) saw the Empire recapture [[Rome]] and much of [[Italy]] from the barbarians, but these successes left the empire's eastern flank exposed.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation. Without notice, ''Iain Lee's Good Evening'' came to an end on 2 November 2007, with the last ten minutes being given to Triple M.\n\n===2008\u20132011: Absolute Radio===\nLee was rehired by his old LBC boss [[David Lloyd (broadcaster)|David Lloyd]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediauk.com/radio/news/125/lbc-97.3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506031643/http://www.mediauk.com/radio/news/125/lbc-97.3|url-status=dead|title=mediauk.com/radio/news/125/lbc-97.3|archive-date=6 May 2009}}</ref> at [[Absolute Radio]] where he presented [[Sunday Night Show|The Sunday Night Show]] from 10:00&nbsp;pm \u2013 1:00&nbsp;am, with a mixture of music and phone-ins.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation. Without notice, ''Iain Lee's Good Evening'' came to an end on 2 November 2007, with the last ten minutes being given to Triple M.\n\n===2008\u20132011: Absolute Radio===\nLee was rehired by his old LBC boss [[David Lloyd (broadcaster)|David Lloyd]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediauk.com/radio/news/125/lbc-97.3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506031643/http://www.mediauk.com/radio/news/125/lbc-97.3|url-status=dead|title=mediauk.com/radio/news/125/lbc-97.3|archive-date=6 May 2009}}</ref> at [[Absolute Radio]] where he presented [[Sunday Night Show|The Sunday Night Show]] from 10:00&nbsp;pm \u2013 1:00&nbsp;am, with a mixture of music and phone-ins.

The bulk of the podcast is made up of a phone-in section, whereby Lee would invite people to call him either by telephone or though Skype at a specific time to discuss one of three topics that Lee would post on Twitter. Listeners were also invited to interact with the show by sending [[AudioBoo]]s, to be included in the recording.\n\nThe podcast also included Lee interviewing guests and celebrity news with the Daily Express's Elisa Roche.\n\n===2012\u20132015: BBC Three Counties Radio and BBC WM===\n[[File:Next Radio 2015 (21274340969).jpg|left|upright|thumb|Lee in 2015]]\nBetween 2012 and 2015, Lee presented the breakfast radio show on [[BBC Three Counties Radio]], broadcast across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire from [[Luton]] and [[Dunstable]].

On 14 November it was reported Lee had been sacked by BBC Three Counties Radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/11/iain-lee-departs-bbc-three-counties-radio/|title=Iain Lee departs BBC Three Counties Radio|date=14 November 2015|work=[[Radio Today (website)|RadioToday.co.uk]]}}</ref>\n\n===2016\u2013present: talkRADIO===\n{{main article|The Late Night Alternative}}\n\nOn 8 February 2016 Lee announced his upcoming job at [[Talkradio|talkRADIO]].

He won the [[Whelen All-American Series|NASCAR Weekly Series]] national championship in 1983.<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\">Schaefer, Paul.  ''Where Stars Are Born: Celebrating 25 Years of NASCAR Weekly Racing''.  Coastal 181, Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA, 2006.  {{ISBN|0-9789261-0-2}}.  pp. 11-15.</ref>  He also raced in [[Winston Cup]] and in the [[Busch Series]].\n\n==Career before national racing==\nAlexander was the 1978 and 1992 track champion at the historic Nashville International Raceway, now known as [[Fairgrounds Speedway]].\n\nIn 1983, driving Late Models on paved tracks for car owner Bobby Ray Jones, he won the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series national championship, and won the NASCAR Grand American Stock Car championship in its final year.  Alexander won 31 of the 56 races that he entered.  Most were at Nashville, Tennessee or Birmingham, Alabama (where he won the track championship), but some ranged as far as South Carolina or Florida.  He was born to a family well-known in the Nashville automotive scene who operated several area franchised dealerships.<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\" />\n\n==NASCAR career==\n===Winston Cup Series===\nAlexander began his national-level racing career in the [[Winston Cup Series]]. He made the field in the Music City 420 in 1980 and performed fairly well, finishing tenth. He ran part of the 1981 season for [[Bob Rogers (NASCAR)|Bob Rogers]]. Most of his finishes in 1981 were in the Top 15 (if he was running). He ran most of the first 22 races in 1984 for car owner [[Dave Marcis]] with limited success. In 1985 he ran a partial schedule for [[Sims Brothers]] and [[Sadler Brothers]]. He drove for the [[Stavola Brothers]] for the final 16 races in 1988, substituting for the injured [[Bobby Allison]].<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\" /> He had his greatest success in 1988, with six top-ten finishes in 18 starts, including a career best 3rd-place finish at the season finale at the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]. In 1989, Alexander drove the Stavola Brothers car at Daytona, but he was hampered by the effects of an injury in the [[Snowball Derby]] at [[Five Flags Speedway]] in [[Pensacola, FL]] the previous December, and resigned from the ride.<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\" /> His final stint in Cup was the first seven races for [[Bobby Allison]] Motorsports in 1990.\n\n===Busch Series===\nAlexander ran a partial season in the [[Busch Series]] in 1986. He ran full-time in 1987 and 1988, and had a win in both seasons (1987 [[Langley Speedway (Virginia)|Langley Speedway]]) and (1988 [[Hickory Motor Speedway]]). He had three career poles. He had 31 Top 10 finishes in his 71 Busch starts.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

''Where Stars Are Born: Celebrating 25 Years of NASCAR Weekly Racing''.  Coastal 181, Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA, 2006.  {{ISBN|0-9789261-0-2}}.  pp. 11-15.</ref>  He also raced in [[Winston Cup]] and in the [[Busch Series]].\n\n==Career before national racing==\nAlexander was the 1978 and 1992 track champion at the historic Nashville International Raceway, now known as [[Fairgrounds Speedway]].\n\nIn 1983, driving Late Models on paved tracks for car owner Bobby Ray Jones, he won the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series national championship, and won the NASCAR Grand American Stock Car championship in its final year.  Alexander won 31 of the 56 races that he entered.  Most were at Nashville, Tennessee or Birmingham, Alabama (where he won the track championship), but some ranged as far as South Carolina or Florida.  He was born to a family well-known in the Nashville automotive scene who operated several area franchised dealerships.<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\" />\n\n==NASCAR career==\n===Winston Cup Series===\nAlexander began his national-level racing career in the [[Winston Cup Series]]. He made the field in the Music City 420 in 1980 and performed fairly well, finishing tenth. He ran part of the 1981 season for [[Bob Rogers (NASCAR)|Bob Rogers]]. Most of his finishes in 1981 were in the Top 15 (if he was running). He ran most of the first 22 races in 1984 for car owner [[Dave Marcis]] with limited success. In 1985 he ran a partial schedule for [[Sims Brothers]] and [[Sadler Brothers]]. He drove for the [[Stavola Brothers]] for the final 16 races in 1988, substituting for the injured [[Bobby Allison]].<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\" /> He had his greatest success in 1988, with six top-ten finishes in 18 starts, including a career best 3rd-place finish at the season finale at the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]. In 1989, Alexander drove the Stavola Brothers car at Daytona, but he was hampered by the effects of an injury in the [[Snowball Derby]] at [[Five Flags Speedway]] in [[Pensacola, FL]] the previous December, and resigned from the ride.<ref name=\"StarsBorn_Alexander\" /> His final stint in Cup was the first seven races for [[Bobby Allison]] Motorsports in 1990.\n\n===Busch Series===\nAlexander ran a partial season in the [[Busch Series]] in 1986. He ran full-time in 1987 and 1988, and had a win in both seasons (1987 [[Langley Speedway (Virginia)|Langley Speedway]]) and (1988 [[Hickory Motor Speedway]]). He had three career poles. He had 31 Top 10 finishes in his 71 Busch starts.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections.

In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials.

Biological weapons allow for the potential to create a level of destruction and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons, relative to their mass and cost of development and storage. Therefore, biological agents may be useful as strategic deterrents in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430190200/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html|date=30 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents ([[smallpox]], [[pneumonic plague]]) have the capability of person-to-person [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] via [[Bioaerosol|aerosolized]] [[Droplet contact|respiratory droplets]]. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. Worse still, such a weapon could \"escape\" the laboratory where it was developed, even if there was no intent to use it - for example by infecting a researcher who then transmits it to the outside world before realizing that they were infected.

One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franz|first=David|name-list-format=vanc|title=The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|journal=Arizona University|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219221907/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.\n\nThough herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.

Schaefer's position with the Royals was terminated at the end of the 2005 season, the worst in Royals history.\n\nHe began his managerial career in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], where he won numerous awards. He was twice named Manager of the Year (in 1980 and 1981) at Class A [[Greensboro Grasshoppers|Greensboro]], then a part of the [[New York Yankees]] organization.
