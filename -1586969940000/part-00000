Prior to statehood, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in what became Ohio. American Western University was chartered in 1802 as a result, but never opened. Two years later, the new [[Ohio General Assembly]] chartered [[Ohio University]], which opened for classes in 1809, followed by [[Miami University]], which was chartered in 1809 and opened in 1824.

This system has come under some criticism in recent years as contributing greatly to overlap and redundancies in the higher education system. For example, Ohio's public university system supports nine doctoral programs in history and five law schools while four different public universities in Ohio operate airports and offer aviation programs. At the same time, the system has been lauded for creating powerful \"utility\" organizations, such as [[OhioLINK]] and the [[Ohio Supercomputer Center]], which allow campuses to collaborate and achieve significant efficiencies. A new credit transfer program makes transferring among Ohio's public campuses much easier, and allows students to preview academic programs.\n\n11 of the 14 public universities top the state's enrollment statistics. The remaining three public institutions\u2014[[Shawnee State University]], [[Central State University]] and [[Northeast Ohio Medical University]]\u2014are relatively small.  [[Case Western Reserve University]] is the state's largest private university by enrollment, followed by the [[University of Dayton]], [[Xavier University]], [[Franklin University]], [[Ashland University]], and [[University of Findlay]].\n\n== Institutions ==\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+\nActive institutions\n!School\n!Location(s)\n!Control\n!Type<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].</ref>\n!Enrollment<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].

higher learning. Prior to statehood, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in what became Ohio. American Western University was chartered in 1802 as a result, but never opened. Two years later, the new [[Ohio General Assembly]] chartered [[Ohio University]], which opened for classes in 1809, followed by [[Miami University]], which was chartered in 1809 and opened in 1824.  In northern Ohio, Western Reserve College (now [[Case Western Reserve University]]) was established in 1826.<ref>See [[College Lands]]: Ohio University Chartered, and [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], and {{cite book|title = A compilation of laws, treaties, resolutions, and ordinances: of the general and state governments, which relate to lands in the state of Ohio; including the laws adopted by the governor and judges; the laws of the territorial legislature; and the laws of this state, to the years 1815\u201316 | publisher = G.

This system has come under some criticism in recent years as contributing greatly to overlap and redundancies in the higher education system. For example, Ohio's public university system supports nine doctoral programs in history and five law schools while four different public universities in Ohio operate airports and offer aviation programs. At the same time, the system has been lauded for creating powerful \"utility\" organizations, such as [[OhioLINK]] and the [[Ohio Supercomputer Center]], which allow campuses to collaborate and achieve significant efficiencies. A new credit transfer program makes transferring among Ohio's public campuses much easier, and allows students to preview academic programs.\n\n11 of the 14 public universities top the state's enrollment statistics. The remaining three public institutions\u2014[[Shawnee State University]], [[Central State University]] and [[Northeast Ohio Medical University]]\u2014are relatively small.  [[Case Western Reserve University]] is the state's largest private university by enrollment, followed by the [[University of Dayton]], [[Xavier University]], [[Franklin University]], [[Ashland University]], and [[University of Findlay]].\n\n== Institutions ==\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+\nActive institutions\n!School\n!Location(s)\n!Control\n!Type<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].</ref>\n!Enrollment<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].

Vani is the daughter of the rich landlord who lives in the city while their lands are under the supervision of her cousin and suitor, the wily Kannan. On a visit to the village with her friends, Vani meets Mohan. Mohan and Vani find themselves falling in love with each other gradually.\n\nMeanwhile, a spacecraft is moving rapidly towards the earth. Inside are two aliens who resemble earthly humans. From their conversation it is understood that they are travelling to Earth on a strange mission. Apparently their planet has made far-reaching strides in science, but is woefully backward in performing arts. Hence they are coming to Earth to identify and take a talented artiste who could teach their denizens music and dance. As they near Earth, one of the aliens, Thinna, who is the commander-in-chief of their planet, switches on a monitor, and the screen shows music and dance performances in various parts of Earth. He seems to be dissatisfied with them all, until he comes across Vani singing. He is mesmerised with her performance and decides that she would best suit their purpose.\n\nReturning home after a clandestine moonlight rendezvous with Mohan, Vani falls into the clutches of the aliens. Thinna drags her inside the spacecraft, while the other alien Malla elects to stay on in the earth for a while. Vani is shocked when she finds herself far away from Earth. The king of the alien planet assures her that she will return safely after she had taught them dance and music. Vani is defiant and furious. However, princess Rajini treats her kindly and Vani agrees to teach her. Meanwhile, back in the earth Vani's father blames Kannan for Vani's disappearance. Kannan goes in search of Vani and comes across a mentally deranged girl called Valli who bears a striking resemblance to Vani. Assuming that she is Vani, he gets her kidnapped and brings her home. Saddened to see his daughter a lunatic, Vani's father agrees for Kannan to marry her, and thus Kannan marries the poor Valli, under the assumption that he is marrying the rich heiress Vani.\n\nMohan spies the alien Malla one night as Malla is getting ready to return to his planet. They have a brief skirmish and Malla dies. Thinna lands in his spacecraft just then to take Malla home. He sees Malla's corpse and places it in an ante-chamber inside the craft. Watching all this, Mohan enters the craft quickly, and dragging Malla's corpse out, he jumps into the ante-chamber. Thinna does not notice this and takes off from the earth. When he nearing his planet, he ejects what he assumes to be Malla's corpse from his spacecraft, but it is actually Mohan who falls into the alien planet. By happenstance Mohan comes across a kind-hearted jester from another planet who is on the way to the palace. This jester takes Mohan to his house and feeds him. As they step outside, the jester is struck dead by a passing meteor. As luck would have it, the jester had resembled Mohan in facial features, and so Mohan takes his place and goes to the palace. There he meets Vani and manages to make her realise his true identity. They outwit the cunning Thinna and return to Earth. Meanwhile, Kannan is caught strangling Valli and is arrested by the police. Mohan and Vani reach home. What happens next transpires the crux of the story.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[M. G. Ramachandran]] as Mohan and the jester\n* [[Bhanumathi Ramakrishna|P.
