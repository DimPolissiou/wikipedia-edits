The colonial-era missionary Ernest Trumpp criticized Sikhism for its incoherent scripture that its followers do not understand.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/> Hew McLeod has criticized the Sikh popular historical literature such as the ''Janamsakhis'' as ahistorical and legendary fiction that misinforms with miracles.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p7\"/> The rituals within major Sikh gurdwaras have been criticized as a form of ritualized idolatry (bibliolatry) where the Sikh scripture is bowed to, put to bed every night and woken up every morning.<ref name=myrvold144/><ref name=\"Jones1976p134\"/> The Sikh community has been criticized as one that historically conflated its spiritual practices with a militant brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book|author=James W.

He found that the Sikh granthis who recited the text in the early 1870s lacked comprehension and its sense of meaning.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/> He stated that \"Sikhs had lost all learning\" and the granthis were misleading.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/> Even for Sikhs the language of the Guru Granth Sahib is considered archaic and hard to understand without an interpreter.<ref>{{cite book|author1=S.

It is for us Occidentals a most painful and almost stupefying task, to read only a single Rag\".<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/> Trumpp criticized Adi Granth to be lacking systematic unity, according to Arvind Pal Singh Mandair \u2013 a Sikhism scholar.<ref>\"Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed\", by Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, p. 87</ref>\n\nTrumpp said that Sikhism was \"a reform movement in spirit\", but \"completely failed to achieve anything of real religious significance\".<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/> He concluded that the most Sikhs do not understand what their scripture's verses mean and any metaphysical speculations therein. The Sikh intelligensia he met during his years of study, stated Trumpp, only had a \"partial understanding\" of their own scripture. Most Sikhs neither observe the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada|rahit-nama]] \u2013\u00a0the Sikh code of conduct, nor were the popular notions of the Sikhs guided by the teachings in the Adi Granth.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/> It was more of a military brotherhood with a martial spirit, inspired by a \"deep fanatical hatred\" for the Muslims given the Sikh sense of their history and identity.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p52\"/>\n\nAccording to the Sikh historian Trilochan Singh, Trumpp's colonial era study and remarks were \"extremely vulgar attacks\" on Sikhism that did not appreciate the Sikh history, culture and religion and it reflected the arrogance of scientific-analytical method. His criticism reflected the bias of his missionary agenda, which assumed that ancient Christian scriptures were coherent, had the right answers, and that all other religions must be held in contempt.<ref name=\"Singh1994\">{{cite book|author=Trilochan Singh|title=Ernest Trumpp and W.H.

These texts are cherished and popular among the Sikhs but they are not factual. These are inventions of myths and miracles that are highly inconsistent.<ref name=\"Ballantyne2006p7\"/> They distort reality with claims such as \"Nanak as a boy miraculously restored a field of wheat after the crop had been ruined by buffaloes\". McLeod dismissed the vast majority of these popular Janamsakhis as legends of faith, less interested in facts and theological inspiration, and more interested in creating popular piety for someone capable of miracles.

Civic Platform came to power following the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 general election]] as the major coalition partner in Poland's government, with party leader [[Donald Tusk]] as [[Prime Minister of Poland]]. Tusk was re-elected as Prime Minister in the [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 general election]] but stepped down three years later to assume the post of [[President of the European Council]]. Prime Minister [[Ewa Kopacz]] led the party in the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 general election]] but was defeated by the [[Law and Justice]] party. On 16 November 2015 Civic Platform government stepped down after exactly 8 years in power. In [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010]] Civic Platform candidate [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] was elected as [[President of Poland]], but failed in running for re-election in [[2015 Polish presidential election|2015]]. PO is the second largest party in the [[Sejm]], with 138 seats, and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], with 33 seats. Civic Platform is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).\nThe party was formed in 2001 as a split from [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS), under the leadership of [[Andrzej Olechowski]] and [[Maciej P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski]], with Donald Tusk of the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] (UW).  In the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 general election]], PO emerged as the largest opposition party, behind the ruling [[centre-left]] party [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD). PO remained the second-largest party at the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]], but this time behind the [[National conservatism|national-conservative]] party [[Law and Justice]] (PiS). [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|In 2007]], Civic Platform overtook PiS, now established as the [[Two-party system|dominant parties]], and formed a [[coalition government]] with the [[Polish People's Party]]. Following the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk disaster of April 2010]], [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] became the first President from PO in the [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010 presidential election]].\n\nSince its creation, the party has shown stronger electoral performances in [[Warsaw]], the west, and the north of Poland.<ref>See e.g. the results of the first round of the 2010 presidential election http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plik:Wybory_prezydenckie_2010_I_tura_BK.png&filetimestamp=20100622224054</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Civic Platform was founded in 2001 as [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]], [[Christian-democratic]] split from existing parties. Founders [[Andrzej Olechowski]], [[Maciej P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski]], and [[Donald Tusk]] were sometimes jokingly called \"the Three Tenors\" by Polish media and commentators. Olechowski and P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski left the party during the 2001\u20132005 parliamentary term, leaving Tusk as the sole remaining founder, and current party leader.\n\nIn the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 general election]] the party secured 12.6% of the vote and 65 deputies in the [[Sejm]], making it the largest opposition party to the government led by the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD).\n\nIn the [[2002 Polish local elections|2002 local elections]] PO stood together with [[Law and Justice]] in 15 voivodeships (in 14 as [[POPiS]], in Podkarpacie with another centre-right political parties). They stood separately only in Mazovia.\n\nIn 2005, PO led all opinion polls with 26% to 30% of public support. However, in the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]], in which it was led by [[Jan Rokita]], PO polled only 24.1% and unexpectedly came second to the 27% garnered by [[Law and Justice]] (PiS). A [[centre-right]] coalition of PO and PiS (nicknamed:PO-PiS) was deemed most likely to form a government after the election. Yet the putative coalition parties had a falling out in the wake of the fiercely contested [[2005 Polish presidential election|Polish presidential election of 2005]].\n\n[[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] (PiS) won the second round of the presidential election on 23 October 2005 with 54% of the vote, ahead of Tusk, the PO candidate. Due to the demands of PiS for control of all the armed ministries (the Defence Ministry, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and the office of the Prime Minister, PO and PiS were unable to form a coalition. Instead, PiS formed a coalition government with the support of the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR) and [[Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland]] (SRP). PO became the opposition to this PiS-led coalition government.\n\nThe PiS-led coalition fell apart in 2007 amid corruption scandal with [[Andrzej Lepper]] and [[Tomasz Lipiec]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7054912.stm BBC News (2007-10-22): Massive win for Polish opposition]</ref> and internal leadership disputes. These events led to the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|new elections in 2007]]. In the 21 October 2007 [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]], PO won 41.51% of the popular vote and 209 out of 460 seats (now 201) in the [[Sejm]] and 60 out of 100 seats (now 56) in the [[Senate of Poland]]. Civic Platform, now the largest party in both houses of parliament, subsequently formed a coalition with the [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL).\n\nAt the [[2010 Polish presidential election]], following the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air disaster]] which killed the incumbent Polish president [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]], Tusk decided not to present his candidature, considered an easy possible victory over PiS leader [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]].

The party also wants to criminalise [[gambling]] and supports [[religious education]] in schools and civil unions. Other socially conservative stances of the party include voting to ban [[designer drugs]] and amending the penal code to introduce mandatory [[chemical castration]] of [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]].\n\nSince 2007, when Civic Platform formed the government, the party has gradually moved from its liberal conservative stances, and many of its politicians hold more liberal positions on social issues. In 2013, the Civic Platform's government introduced public funding of ''[[in vitro]]'' fertilisation program. In 2017, the party supported a citizens' initiative for liberalisation of the [[Abortion in Poland|abortion law]]. Civic Platform also supports [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples.\n\nDespite declaring in the parliamentary election campaign the will to limit taxation in Poland, the Civic Platform has in fact increased it. The party refrained from implementing the flat tax, increasing instead the [[value-added tax]] from 22% to 23% in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekonomia.rp.pl/artykul/517559-Plan-przyjety--VAT-w-gore.html |title=Rzeczpospolita |publisher=rp.pl |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2014-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927235812/http://www.ekonomia.rp.pl/artykul/517559-Plan-przyjety--VAT-w-gore.html |archive-date=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has also increased the excise imposed on diesel oil, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/artykuly/736318,rzad-podwyzsza-akcyze-i-zamraza-place.html|title=z\u0105d podwy\u017csza akcyz\u0119 i zamra\u017ca p\u0142ace|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2013-10-02 |publisher=forsal.pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,101562,10692214,Rzad_zaciska_pasa__zamraza_pensje__podnosi_akcyze.html|title=Rz\u0105d zaciska pasa: zamra\u017ca pensje, podnosi akcyz\u0119 na papierosy i paliwa|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2011-10-23|publisher=wyborcza.biz}}</ref> The party has eliminated many [[tax exemption]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Dzis-dowiemy-sie-dlaczego-rzad-zabierze-nam-ulgi-2578419.html|title=Dzi\u015b dowiemy si\u0119, dlaczego rz\u0105d zabierze nam ulgi|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2012-07-26|publisher=bankier.pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mamstartup.pl/poradnik/5299/zmiany-w-odliczaniu-vat-od-samochodow-sprawdz-ile-i-kiedy-mozesz-odliczyc|author=Sebastian Bobrowski|title=Zmiany w odliczaniu VAT od samochod\u00f3w.

Areas voting for [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] in 2010 are shaded orange above.]]\nToday, Civic Platform enjoys support amongst higher class constituencies. Professionals, academics, managers and businessmen vote for the party in large numbers. People with university degrees support the party more than less educated voters. PO voters tend to be those people who generally benefited from European integration and economic liberalisation since 1989 and are satisfied with their life standard. Many PO voters are [[Social Liberalism|social-liberals]] who value [[environmentalism]], [[secularism]] and [[Europeanisation]]. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] used to vote for the party before PO moved sharply to the left on economic (e.g., increase of taxes) and social issues (e.g., support for civil unions). Young people are another voting bloc that abandoned the party, after their economic and social situation did not improve significantly when PO was in government.\n\nAreas that are more likely to vote for PO are in the west and north of the country, especially parts of the former [[Prussia]] before 1918. Many of these people previously used to vote for the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] when that party enjoyed support and influence. Large cities in the whole country prefer the party, rather than rural areas and smaller towns. This is caused by the [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[secular]] and social liberalism urban voters tend to value. In urban areas, conservative principles are much less identified with by voters. Large cities in Poland have a better economic climate, which draws support to PO. Areas with higher concentration of minorities, such as [[German minority in Poland|Germans]] or [[Belarusian minority in Poland|Belarusians]], support the party due to its smaller emphasis on [[patriotism]] and [[national conservatism]].\n\n==Leadership==\n\n===Chairmen===\n\n*[[Maciej P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski]] (18 October 2001 \u2013 1 June 2003)\n*[[Donald Tusk]] (1 June 2003\u2013 8 November 2014)\n*[[Ewa Kopacz]] (8 November 2014\u2013 26 January 2016)\n*[[Grzegorz Schetyna]] (26 January 2016\u2013 29 January 2020)\n*[[Borys Budka]] (since 29 January 2020)\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Sejm===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

Civic Platform came to power following the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 general election]] as the major coalition partner in Poland's government, with party leader [[Donald Tusk]] as [[Prime Minister of Poland]]. Tusk was re-elected as Prime Minister in the [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 general election]] but stepped down three years later to assume the post of [[President of the European Council]]. Prime Minister [[Ewa Kopacz]] led the party in the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 general election]] but was defeated by the [[Law and Justice]] party. On 16 November 2015 Civic Platform government stepped down after exactly 8 years in power. In [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010]] Civic Platform candidate [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] was elected as [[President of Poland]], but failed in running for re-election in [[2015 Polish presidential election|2015]]. PO is the second largest party in the [[Sejm]], with 138 seats, and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], with 33 seats. Civic Platform is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).\nThe party was formed in 2001 as a split from [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS), under the leadership of [[Andrzej Olechowski]] and [[Maciej P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski]], with Donald Tusk of the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] (UW).  In the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 general election]], PO emerged as the largest opposition party, behind the ruling [[centre-left]] party [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD). PO remained the second-largest party at the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]], but this time behind the [[National conservatism|national-conservative]] party [[Law and Justice]] (PiS). [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|In 2007]], Civic Platform overtook PiS, now established as the [[Two-party system|dominant parties]], and formed a [[coalition government]] with the [[Polish People's Party]]. Following the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk disaster of April 2010]], [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] became the first President from PO in the [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010 presidential election]].\n\nSince its creation, the party has shown stronger electoral performances in [[Warsaw]], the west, and the north of Poland.<ref>See e.g. the results of the first round of the 2010 presidential election http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plik:Wybory_prezydenckie_2010_I_tura_BK.png&filetimestamp=20100622224054</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Civic Platform was founded in 2001 as [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]], [[Christian-democratic]] split from existing parties. Founders [[Andrzej Olechowski]], [[Maciej P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski]], and [[Donald Tusk]] were sometimes jokingly called \"the Three Tenors\" by Polish media and commentators. Olechowski and P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski left the party during the 2001\u20132005 parliamentary term, leaving Tusk as the sole remaining founder, and current party leader.\n\nIn the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 general election]] the party secured 12.6% of the vote and 65 deputies in the [[Sejm]], making it the largest opposition party to the government led by the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD).\n\nIn the [[2002 Polish local elections|2002 local elections]] PO stood together with [[Law and Justice]] in 15 voivodeships (in 14 as [[POPiS]], in Podkarpacie with another centre-right political parties). They stood separately only in Mazovia.\n\nIn 2005, PO led all opinion polls with 26% to 30% of public support. However, in the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]], in which it was led by [[Jan Rokita]], PO polled only 24.1% and unexpectedly came second to the 27% garnered by [[Law and Justice]] (PiS). A [[centre-right]] coalition of PO and PiS (nicknamed:PO-PiS) was deemed most likely to form a government after the election. Yet the putative coalition parties had a falling out in the wake of the fiercely contested [[2005 Polish presidential election|Polish presidential election of 2005]].\n\n[[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] (PiS) won the second round of the presidential election on 23 October 2005 with 54% of the vote, ahead of Tusk, the PO candidate. Due to the demands of PiS for control of all the armed ministries (the Defence Ministry, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and the office of the Prime Minister, PO and PiS were unable to form a coalition. Instead, PiS formed a coalition government with the support of the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR) and [[Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland]] (SRP). PO became the opposition to this PiS-led coalition government.\n\nThe PiS-led coalition fell apart in 2007 amid corruption scandal with [[Andrzej Lepper]] and [[Tomasz Lipiec]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7054912.stm BBC News (2007-10-22): Massive win for Polish opposition]</ref> and internal leadership disputes. These events led to the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|new elections in 2007]]. In the 21 October 2007 [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]], PO won 41.51% of the popular vote and 209 out of 460 seats (now 201) in the [[Sejm]] and 60 out of 100 seats (now 56) in the [[Senate of Poland]]. Civic Platform, now the largest party in both houses of parliament, subsequently formed a coalition with the [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL).\n\nAt the [[2010 Polish presidential election]], following the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air disaster]] which killed the incumbent Polish president [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]], Tusk decided not to present his candidature, considered an easy possible victory over PiS leader [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]]. During the PO [[primary election]]s, [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] defeated the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated, PiS defector Foreign Minister [[Rados\u0142aw Sikorski]]. At the polls, Komorowski defeated [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]], ensuring PO dominance over the current Polish political landscape.<ref name=WBJ>[http://www.wbj.pl/blog/The_business_of_politics/post-254-civic-platform-almighty.htm Warsaw Business Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220053333/http://www.wbj.pl/blog/The_business_of_politics/post-254-civic-platform-almighty.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2010, local elections granted Civic Platform about 30.1 percent of the votes and PiS at 23.2 percent, an increase for the former and a drop for the latter compared to the 2006 elections.<ref name=WBJ/>\n\nPO succeeded in winning four consecutive elections (a record in post-communist Poland), and Tusk remains as [[kingmaker]].

The party also wants to criminalise [[gambling]] and supports [[religious education]] in schools and civil unions. Other socially conservative stances of the party include voting to ban [[designer drugs]] and amending the penal code to introduce mandatory [[chemical castration]] of [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]].\n\nSince 2007, when Civic Platform formed the government, the party has gradually moved from its liberal conservative stances, and many of its politicians hold more liberal positions on social issues. In 2013, the Civic Platform's government introduced public funding of ''[[in vitro]]'' fertilisation program. In 2017, the party supported a citizens' initiative for liberalisation of the [[Abortion in Poland|abortion law]]. Civic Platform also supports [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples.\n\nDespite declaring in the parliamentary election campaign the will to limit taxation in Poland, the Civic Platform has in fact increased it. The party refrained from implementing the flat tax, increasing instead the [[value-added tax]] from 22% to 23% in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekonomia.rp.pl/artykul/517559-Plan-przyjety--VAT-w-gore.html |title=Rzeczpospolita |publisher=rp.pl |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2014-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927235812/http://www.ekonomia.rp.pl/artykul/517559-Plan-przyjety--VAT-w-gore.html |archive-date=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has also increased the excise imposed on diesel oil, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/artykuly/736318,rzad-podwyzsza-akcyze-i-zamraza-place.html|title=z\u0105d podwy\u017csza akcyz\u0119 i zamra\u017ca p\u0142ace|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2013-10-02 |publisher=forsal.pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,101562,10692214,Rzad_zaciska_pasa__zamraza_pensje__podnosi_akcyze.html|title=Rz\u0105d zaciska pasa: zamra\u017ca pensje, podnosi akcyz\u0119 na papierosy i paliwa|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2011-10-23|publisher=wyborcza.biz}}</ref> The party has eliminated many [[tax exemption]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Dzis-dowiemy-sie-dlaczego-rzad-zabierze-nam-ulgi-2578419.html|title=Dzi\u015b dowiemy si\u0119, dlaczego rz\u0105d zabierze nam ulgi|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2012-07-26|publisher=bankier.pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mamstartup.pl/poradnik/5299/zmiany-w-odliczaniu-vat-od-samochodow-sprawdz-ile-i-kiedy-mozesz-odliczyc|author=Sebastian Bobrowski|title=Zmiany w odliczaniu VAT od samochod\u00f3w.

Areas voting for [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] in 2010 are shaded orange above.]]\nToday, Civic Platform enjoys support amongst higher class constituencies. Professionals, academics, managers and businessmen vote for the party in large numbers. People with university degrees support the party more than less educated voters. PO voters tend to be those people who generally benefited from European integration and economic liberalisation since 1989 and are satisfied with their life standard. Many PO voters are [[Social Liberalism|social-liberals]] who value [[environmentalism]], [[secularism]] and [[Europeanisation]]. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] used to vote for the party before PO moved sharply to the left on economic (e.g., increase of taxes) and social issues (e.g., support for civil unions). Young people are another voting bloc that abandoned the party, after their economic and social situation did not improve significantly when PO was in government.\n\nAreas that are more likely to vote for PO are in the west and north of the country, especially parts of the former [[Prussia]] before 1918. Many of these people previously used to vote for the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] when that party enjoyed support and influence. Large cities in the whole country prefer the party, rather than rural areas and smaller towns. This is caused by the [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[secular]] and social liberalism urban voters tend to value. In urban areas, conservative principles are much less identified with by voters. Large cities in Poland have a better economic climate, which draws support to PO. Areas with higher concentration of minorities, such as [[German minority in Poland|Germans]] or [[Belarusian minority in Poland|Belarusians]], support the party due to its smaller emphasis on [[patriotism]] and [[national conservatism]].\n\n==Leadership==\n\n===Chairmen===\n\n*[[Maciej P\u0142a\u017cy\u0144ski]] (18 October 2001 \u2013 1 June 2003)\n*[[Donald Tusk]] (1 June 2003\u2013 8 November 2014)\n*[[Ewa Kopacz]] (8 November 2014\u2013 26 January 2016)\n*[[Grzegorz Schetyna]] (26 January 2016\u2013 29 January 2020)\n*[[Borys Budka]] (since 29 January 2020)\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Sejm===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

While the post was in [[Russian America]], the Hudson's Bay Company continued to trade there until the American traders expelled it in 1869, following the [[Alaska Purchase]] when the [[Alaska Commercial Company]] took over the post.\n\nDuring the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], in the winter of 1897&ndash;1898, Fort Yukon received two hundred prospectors from Dawson City, which was short of supply.<ref name=\"Hougen1897\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hougengroup.com/yukonhistory/nuggets_year/2000s.aspx?nugget=1897#STARVATION|title=1897 - Yukon Nuggets  - Yukon History|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007192321/http://www.hougengroup.com/yukonhistory/nuggets_year/2000s.aspx?nugget=1897#STARVATION|archivedate=2011-10-07}}</ref> A post office was established on July 12, 1898 with John Hawksly as its first postmaster.

It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse of [[Mughal Empire|Muslim political hegemony]] to the [[Maratha Empire]] and the subsequent consolidation of the [[British raj]].\n\nThe emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as ''[[Shuddhi]]'' (purification) and ''Sanghatan'' (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.<ref name=\"Ballard 1994 64\">{{harvnb|Ballard|1994|p=64}}</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nMuhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the [[Quran]] decreed,<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite quran|3|104 |s=ns}}</ref><ref name=p65/> as his teacher [[Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi]] dreamed of doing.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|p=xiii}}</ref> The inspiration for this came during his second [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1926.<ref name='Agwani'>{{Cite book |last=Agwani |first=Mohammad Shafi |year=1986 |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in India |publisher=Twenty First Century Indian Society |page=41 |ref=harv }}</ref> What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal.<ref name=AMFO1994:513>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=513}}</ref> He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the [[Mewati]] Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices.

This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainly [[ulama]]-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote ''dawah'' as a mechanism of self-reform.<ref name=AMFO1994:515>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=515}}</ref>\n\nLike Salafists, Tabligh seek a \"separation in their daily life from the `impious` society that surrounded them\".

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.

During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs.<ref name=womenbm/> These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighbourhood members.<ref name=\"bmppp\"/>\n\nDuring their stay in mosques, these ''jamaats'' conduct a daily ''gasht'', which involves visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably with the help of a guide.<ref name=Eva/> They invite people to attend the ''[[Maghrib]]'' prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|pp=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the assumed role of these ''jamaat'' members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as ''khidmat'' which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements.<ref name=womenbm/> The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's ''mashwara''. The markaz keeps records of each ''jamaat'' and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>  Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-who-are-the-tablighi-jamaat-the-organisation-at-the-epicentre-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-india/article31238915.ece|title=Explained  Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?}}</ref>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{under construction}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = \n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = {{CAN}}\n|prevshow    =Greenline \n|website     = \n|spouse=Deborah Green|awards=}}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[radio personality]],<ref name=\"OCOct05\">{{cite news | title=Imagine Lowell Green stoned: Then think about farm animals | newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | date=7 October 2005 | page=F1 | first=Kelly | last=Egan }}</ref> [[journalist]], and [[author]], best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHonours and awards:Added citations.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

Raised near a [[temple]] where she was taught Korean, her father abandoned her family 20 years ago, although her mother still longs for his return. Jin Joo works hard to earn money for a cure for her mother's [[night blindness]]. However, the doctor reveals her condition to be irreversible. As her final wish, Jin Joo's mother asks to be able to see Jin Joo's father one last time before she goes blind. In an act of desperation, she convinces her clients, Jun Woo's mother '''Jung Han Sook''' and aunt '''Kang Koon Ja''' ([[Park Mi-sun]]), to take her to Korea as Jun Woo's bride in order to find her father. They both agree, finding her more suitable than the other brides. Jin Joo travels to [[Seoul]], pretending to be Korean, and the two marry.\n\nThough their relationship had begun with a mutual agreement that it was a fake marriage and that they would secretly live as friends (which meant not sharing the same bed), Jin Joo's genuine effort to support him touches Jun Woo's heart and they eventually fell in love. With her mother's illness worsening, Jun Woo quickly begins to help search for Jin Joo's father.\n\n===Jun Woo, Ji Young and Young Min===\n'''Kang Jun Woo''' ([[Song Chang-eui]]) met '''Ok Ji Young''' ([[Choi Yeo-jin]]) at [[Seoul National University|Seoul University]] and they were engaged. However, after Ji Young goes to [[Chicago]] to study abroad, she abruptly breaks off their relationship, not telling him it was due to her mother's financial problems. Jun Woo shortly rushes to Chicago and has a violent encounter with her that resulted in Ji Young calling the police. They violently beat Jun Woo and lock him up in an American prison for three months. This severely traumatized Jun Woo, causing him to develop a serious heart condition and [[melancholia]]. In an attempt to improve his health, Jun Woo's mother flies to Vietnam in search of a wife.\n\nThree years later, Ji Young marries '''Kim Young Min''' ([[Song Jong-ho]]). Although unaware of the family feud, Ji Young hides her past with Jun Woo, as well as her strained relationship with her wayward mother, whom she is ashamed of. This ultimately leads to the destruction of her marriage.\n\n===Han Sook, Ok Kyung and Sang Il===\nA lifelong cold war exists between '''Jung Han Sook''' ([[Kim Mi-sook]]) and '''Yang Ok Kyung''' ([[Kyeon Mi-ri]]), starting from high school where Ok Kyung steals Han Sook's boyfriend, '''Kim Sang Il''' ([[Im Chae-moo]]), and marries him after faking a pregnancy. Their two sons Young Min and Young Soo grew up in a luxurious household while Han Sook's family struggled. The feud intensifies when Han Sook discovers that Young Min's new wife is Ok Ji Young, the woman responsible for Jun Woo's condition.\n\nThough from the outside Ok Kyung and Sang Il's marriage seems happy, there is a damaging past. 22 years ago, Sang Il had abandoned his family to go overseas, not contacting them for 2 years. This led to Ok Kyung to fall into depression and started drinking. When he returned, they resume their marriage as if nothing happened, but Ok Kyung secretly dreads what might have happened during his absence.\n\n===Sae Mi and Young Soo===\n'''Kang Sae Mi''' ([[Han Yeo-woon]]) is Jun Woo's younger sister who works as a [[Model (person)|model]]. By coincidence, she catches the eye of '''Kim Young Soo''' ([[Kim Heechul]]), younger brother of Young Min, at a club. Rejected on the basis of being told that he is a rich playboy, Young Soo goes through several changes in order to impress her, much to the amusement of his family. After getting a job as the [[security guard]] at Sae Mi's modeling agency, Young Soo attempts to woo her again, but it's when he discovers her ambition to become an [[actress]], Sae Mi softens after he encourages her to audition at his father's company.\n\nTheir relationship finally blossoms after he helps her win a competition for a hotel gift card for Jin Joo and Jun Woo's [[honeymoon]], although Young Soo had mistakenly thought it had been for them. Sae Mi and Young Soo remain oblivious to the family feud for most of the drama series, but when it is discovered, they are inevitably affected.\n\n===Won Mi and Dong Gu===\n'''Kang Won-mi''' ([[Hong Eun-hee]]) is Jun Woo and Sae Mi's older sister, the eldest of the siblings. Though in her early 30s, she is unmarried and is often rejected at [[dating services]]. She works as a [[music teacher]] to children, teaching the [[violin]]. '''Heo Dong Gu''' ([[Kim Kyung-sik]]) is a [[law student]] who has for years tried to woo Sae Mi by becoming her [[Chauffeur|driver]], although he is repeatedly turned down. In an attempt to win her over, Dong Gu asks Won Mi to help, getting them both into strange and hilarious situations. After joining the [[military]] and keeping in contact with her only through letters, Dong Gu falls in love with Won Mi instead, although at this time Won Mi begins dating a [[dentist]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Song Jong-ho]] as Kim Young-min\n* [[Lee Young-ah]] as Nguyen Jin-joo\n* [[Song Chang-eui]] as Kang Jun-woo\n* [[Choi Yeo-jin]] as Ok Ji-young\n* [[Kim Heechul]] as Kim Young-soo\n* [[Han Yeo-woon]] as Kang Sae-mi\n* [[Kim Mi-sook]] as Jung Han-sook (Jun Woo's mother)\n* [[Kang Shin-il]] as Kang Woo-nam (Jun Woo's father)\n* [[Hong Eun-hee]] as Kang Won-mi (Jun Woo's older sister)\n* [[Kyeon Mi-ri]] as Yang Ok-kyung (Young Min and Young Soo's mother)\n* [[Im Chae-moo]] as Kim Sang-il / Richard Kim (Young Min's father)\n* [[Park Mi-sun]] as Kang Koon-ja (Woo Nam's sister)\n* [[Kim Kyung-sik]] as Heo Dong-gu\n* [[Nh\u01b0 Qu\u1ef3nh (actress)|Nh\u01b0 Qu\u1ef3nh]] (Jin Joo's mother)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Central Oregon Community College.</ref>\n\nEthnologists and anthropologists{{which|date=December 2013}} who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a [[wikt:literal|literal]] or logical sense.  Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long writes, \"The beings referred to in the myth \u2013 gods, animals, plants \u2013 are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of [[being]] from non-being.<ref>{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}</ref> In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life. Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nHistorian [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths:\n<blockquote>\nEach beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ...

Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that reappear in stories the world over. The classification identifies five basic types:<ref name=\"lm3233\">{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32\u201333}}</ref>\n[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brahma|Brahm\u0101]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' of creation, emerges from a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] risen from the navel of [[Vishnu|Vi\u1e63\u0146u]], who lies with [[Lakshmi]] on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]].]]\n\n* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.\n* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.\n* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.\n* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.\n* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing order from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].\n\n[[Marta Weigle]] further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n\nAn alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n* Primeval [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], an infinite expanse of waters or space.\n* Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss.\n* Originator deity poised above the abyss.\n* [[Cosmic egg]] or [[embryo]].\n* Originator deity creating life through sound or word.\n* Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity.\n\n===''Ex nihilo''===\n{{main|Ex nihilo}}\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|upright|''Creation'' on the exterior shutters of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s [[triptych]] ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1490\u20131510)]]\n\nThe myth that God created the world out of nothing \u2013 ''[[ex nihilo]]'' \u2013 is central today to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} Nonetheless, the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} In the early 2nd century AD, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}\n\n''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]], and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1\u20133, 153}}</ref>  In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is \"from nothing\" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos. In ''ex nihilo'' creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|pages=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\n===Creation from chaos===\n{{main|Chaos (cosmogony)}}\nIn creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word \"chaos\" means \"disorder\", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to \"order\" (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}</ref> One example is the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] from the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n===World parent===\n[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In one [[M\u0101ori mythology|Maori creation myth]], the primal couple are [[Rangi and Papa]], depicted holding each other in a tight embrace.]]\nThere are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}</ref> One example of this is the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] creation myth described in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' exactly in the poem [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=creation+myth+in+voluspa#v=onepage&q=creation%20myth%20in%20voluspa&f=false|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=David Adams|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841749|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence===\nIn emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the ''ex nihilo'' variety.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\">{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Creation\"|2011a}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Image-sipapu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|In the [[kiva]] of both [[Ancestral Puebloans|ancient]] and present-day [[Pueblo people]]s, the [[sipapu]] is a small round hole in the floor that represents the portal through which the ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]]. (The larger hole is a fire pit, here in a ruin from the [[Mesa Verde National Park]].)]]\nEmergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21\u201324}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963}}</ref>  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Earth-diver===\nThe earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Earth-Diver Creation\"|2011b}}</ref> Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions. The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography of Asia#East Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the [[North America]]n continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168\u201370}}</ref><ref>[[Vladimir Napolskikh]] (2012), ''[https://www.academia.edu/4918926/Diving_Bird_Myth_after_20_years_2012 Earth-Diver Myth (\u0410812) in northern Eurasia and North America: twenty years later]''</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.<ref>{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div

Central Oregon Community College.</ref>\n\nEthnologists and anthropologists{{which|date=December 2013}} who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a [[wikt:literal|literal]] or logical sense.  Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long writes, \"The beings referred to in the myth \u2013 gods, animals, plants \u2013 are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of [[being]] from non-being.<ref>{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}</ref> In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life. Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nHistorian [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths:\n<blockquote>\nEach beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ...

The classification identifies five basic types:<ref name=\"lm3233\">{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32\u201333}}</ref>\n[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brahma|Brahm\u0101]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' of creation, emerges from a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] risen from the navel of [[Vishnu|Vi\u1e63\u0146u]], who lies with [[Lakshmi]] on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]].]]\n\n* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.\n* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.\n* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.\n* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.\n* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing order from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].\n\n[[Marta Weigle]] further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n\nAn alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n* Primeval [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], an infinite expanse of waters or space.\n* Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss.\n* Originator deity poised above the abyss.\n* [[Cosmic egg]] or [[embryo]].\n* Originator deity creating life through sound or word.\n* Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity.\n\n===''Ex nihilo''===\n{{main|Ex nihilo}}\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|upright|''Creation'' on the exterior shutters of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s [[triptych]] ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1490\u20131510)]]\n\nThe myth that God created the world out of nothing \u2013 ''[[ex nihilo]]'' \u2013 is central today to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} Nonetheless, the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} In the early 2nd century AD, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}\n\n''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]], and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1\u20133, 153}}</ref>  In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is \"from nothing\" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos. In ''ex nihilo'' creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|pages=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\n===Creation from chaos===\n{{main|Chaos (cosmogony)}}\nIn creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word \"chaos\" means \"disorder\", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to \"order\" (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}</ref> One example is the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] from the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n===World parent===\n[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In one [[M\u0101ori mythology|Maori creation myth]], the primal couple are [[Rangi and Papa]], depicted holding each other in a tight embrace.]]\nThere are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}</ref> One example of this is the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] creation myth described in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' exactly in the poem [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=creation+myth+in+voluspa#v=onepage&q=creation%20myth%20in%20voluspa&f=false|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=David Adams|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841749|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence===\nIn emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the ''ex nihilo'' variety.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\">{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Creation\"|2011a}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Image-sipapu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|In the [[kiva]] of both [[Ancestral Puebloans|ancient]] and present-day [[Pueblo people]]s, the [[sipapu]] is a small round hole in the floor that represents the portal through which the ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]]. (The larger hole is a fire pit, here in a ruin from the [[Mesa Verde National Park]].)]]\nEmergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21\u201324}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963}}</ref>  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Earth-diver===\nThe earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Earth-Diver Creation\"|2011b}}</ref> Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions. The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography of Asia#East Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the [[North America]]n continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168\u201370}}</ref><ref>[[Vladimir Napolskikh]] (2012), ''[https://www.academia.edu/4918926/Diving_Bird_Myth_after_20_years_2012 Earth-Diver Myth (\u0410812) in northern Eurasia and North America: twenty years later]''</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.<ref>{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div
