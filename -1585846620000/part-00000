Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal. In their second loss of the season against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 51\u201354, the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points. Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records. He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the 3rd to throw for 50 touchdowns. He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns. For his performance during the season, he was named [[Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award|AP NFL MVP]], the first Chief to win the award.\n\nIn the AFC Divisional round on January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 31\u201313 to move on to the AFC Championship Game. This marked the Chiefs' first playoff win in Arrowhead Stadium in 25 years. This also enabled the Chiefs to host the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever. However, the following week, Kansas City's bid for its first Super Bowl berth in 49 years ended with a 31\u201337 overtime loss to the [[New England Patriots]].\n\nThe Chiefs finished the [[2019 NFL season|2019 regular season]] with a 12\u20134 record, winning the [[AFC West]] division title, and the AFC's second seed behind the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Chiefs defeated the [[Houston Texans]] 51\u201331 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24\u20130 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns. The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed [[Tennessee Titans]]. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35\u201324 and advanced to [[Super Bowl LIV]]. This marked their first appearance in a Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl IV]], 50 years earlier. \n\nOn February 2, 2020, in [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]], the Chiefs played [[Super Bowl LIV]], against the NFC top seed, the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. With the game tied at 10 points each at halftime, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in the 3rd quarter, which enabled the 49ers to take a 20\u201310 lead to the fourth quarter. However, the Chiefs advanced down field, and Mahomes rebounded big-time, throwing 2 touchdowns, to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], respectively. With a 24\u201320 lead with under three minutes remaining, Williams had his second touchdown of the night, a 38-yard run, and the Chiefs lead 31\u201320. The game was sealed with a [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] interception with under a minute remaining. This marked the first time in NFL post-season history that a team faced 10 point deficits in 3 straight games, and won all 3 by 10 or more points.

Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs have never worn an alternate jersey in a game, although custom jerseys are sold for retail.\n\nThe Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would be forced to wear their black uniforms on a day that forecasted for steamy temperatures.<ref>Ferrin, Reid.

However, they managed one of the most improbable season comebacks in the NFL and won ten straight to improve their record from 1\u20135 to 11\u20135. The team clinched a playoff berth after a 17\u201313 win over Cleveland in Week 16 to become only the second NFL team to do so after the merger.{{clarify|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe streak achieved by the Chiefs broke a franchise record for 9 straight (2003, 2013) and second 9 plus game win streak under Reid. After a Week 17 win over Oakland 23\u201317, the Chiefs achieved their longest winning streak in franchise history at ten games. They qualified for the playoffs, playing in the [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs|2015 AFC Wild-Card playoff game]], held at [[NRG Stadium]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] on January 9, 2016. The Chiefs defeated the [[Houston Texans]] 30\u20130 to earn their first [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoff]] win in 23 seasons, dating back to the [[1993\u201394 NFL playoffs]], a win that also came in Houston. The Chiefs' Wild-Card playoff victory ended what was at the time the third-longest [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|drought]] in the NFL, and it also ended a then NFL record eight-game playoff losing streak.<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Kansas City Chiefs dominate Texans in Houston|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2016010900/2015/POST18/chiefs@texans#cat-post-recap-full-story|publisher=National Football League|date=January 9, 2016|accessdate=January 21, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119214232/http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2016010900/2015/POST18/chiefs%40texans#cat-post-recap-full-story|archivedate=January 19, 2016}}</ref> Riddled with injuries, they were defeated by the New England Patriots 27\u201320 in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nAfter facing a 24\u20133 deficit with six minutes left in the 3rd quarter, the Chiefs engineered a 33\u201327 comeback win against the [[San Diego Chargers]] ending with a two-yard touchdown run by Alex Smith in overtime to give the Chiefs their largest regular season comeback to start the season at 1\u20130.\n\nOn [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas Day]], the Chiefs defeated the [[Denver Broncos]] 33\u201310 to give Kansas City their tenth straight win against divisional opponents.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, the Chiefs clinched the AFC West and the second seed going into the playoffs that year.

This included victories over division rivals [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Denver Broncos]] (twice), along with important conference victories over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal. In their second loss of the season against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] 51\u201354, the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points. Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records. He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the 3rd to throw for 50 touchdowns. He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns. For his performance during the season, he was named [[Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award|AP NFL MVP]], the first Chief to win the award.\n\nIn the AFC Divisional round on January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 31\u201313 to move on to the AFC Championship Game. This marked the Chiefs' first playoff win in Arrowhead Stadium in 25 years. This also enabled the Chiefs to host the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever. However, the following week, Kansas City's bid for its first Super Bowl berth in 49 years ended with a 31\u201337 overtime loss to the [[New England Patriots]].\n\nThe Chiefs finished the [[2019 NFL season|2019 regular season]] with a 12\u20134 record, winning the [[AFC West]] division title, and the AFC's second seed behind the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Chiefs defeated the [[Houston Texans]] 51\u201331 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24\u20130 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns. The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed [[Tennessee Titans]]. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35\u201324 and advanced to [[Super Bowl LIV]]. This marked their first appearance in a Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl IV]], 50 years earlier. \n\nOn February 2, 2020, in [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]], the Chiefs played [[Super Bowl LIV]], against the NFC top seed, the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. With the game tied at 10 points each at halftime, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in the 3rd quarter, which enabled the 49ers to take a 20\u201310 lead to the fourth quarter. However, the Chiefs advanced down field, and Mahomes rebounded big-time, throwing 2 touchdowns, to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], respectively. With a 24\u201320 lead with under three minutes remaining, Williams had his second touchdown of the night, a 38-yard run, and the Chiefs lead 31\u201320. The game was sealed with a [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] interception with under a minute remaining. This marked the first time in NFL post-season history that a team faced 10 point deficits in 3 straight games, and won all 3 by 10 or more points. Patrick Mahomes won the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]]. This was the teams' first championship since 1969, and their first since the [[AFL-NFL Merger]].\n\n==Championships==\n===Super Bowl Championships===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Super Bowl\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|MVP\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1969 || [[Hank Stram]] || [[Super Bowl IV|IV]] || [[New Orleans|New Orleans, LA]] || [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] || 23\u20137 || QB [[Len Dawson]] || 11\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 2019 || [[Andy Reid]] || [[Super Bowl LIV|LIV]] || [[Miami|Miami, FL]] || [[2019 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] || 31\u201320 || QB [[Patrick Mahomes]] ||  12\u20134\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"\n| colspan=\"7\"|'''Total Super Bowl championships won:'''\n| colspan=\"1\"|'''2'''\n|}\n\n===American Football League Championships===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Game\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1962 || [[Hank Stram]] || [[1962 American Football League Championship Game|1962 AFL Championship Game]] || [[Houston|Houston, TX]] || [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] || 20\u201317 || 12\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1966 || [[Hank Stram]] || [[1966 American Football League Championship Game|1966 AFL Championship Game]] || [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]] || [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] || 31\u20137 || 12\u20132\u20131\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1969 || [[Hank Stram]] || [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969 AFL Championship Game]] || [[Oakland|Oakland, CA]] || [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] || 17-7 || 12\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"\n| colspan=\"6\"|'''Total AFL championships won:'''\n| colspan=\"1\"|'''3'''\n|}\n\n===American Football Conference Championships===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 2019 || [[Andy Reid]] || [[Kansas City, MO]] || [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] || 35\u201324 || 15\u20134\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Kansas City Chiefs}};\"\n| colspan=\"5\"|'''Total AFC championships won:'''\n| colspan=\"1\"|'''1'''\n|}\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n{{Main|Logos and uniforms of the Kansas City Chiefs}}\nWhen the Texans began playing in 1960, the team's logo consisted of the state of [[Texas]] in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas.

Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs have never worn an alternate jersey in a game, although custom jerseys are sold for retail.\n\nThe Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals.

She has made it to three WTA tournament finals (only winning one). She is managed by Muse Group, a sports marketing agency based in Tokyo.\n\n==Junior career==\nDoi began playing tennis at the age of three. She first distinguished herself in tennis as a middle-school student, reaching the semifinals of the All Japan Middle School Tennis Championships in both 2004 and 2006 and joining the [[ITF Junior Circuit]] in 2006. In 2007, while enrolled as a freshman in Sundai K\u014dei High School, Doi earned second place in the Japan Open Junior Championships in [[Nagoya]].\n\nA highlight of Doi's junior career was her successful doubles partnership with age-mate [[Kurumi Nara]]. They placed second in girls' doubles at the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships]], becoming only the second Japanese pair to reach the finals of a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] juniors event since [[Yuka Yoshida]] and [[Hiroko Mochizuki]] at the [[1993 US Open (tennis)|1993 US Open]]. Doi and Nara continued their run by advancing to the girls' doubles semifinals at a number of high-profile tournaments, such as the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]] and [[Wimbledon 2008]]. Doi also teamed with Romanian [[Elena Bogdan]] to place second in girls' doubles at the [[2008 Australian Open]]. This flurry of successes catapulted Doi to No. 3 in Japan's under-18 tennis rankings for 2007; she had been recognized early on as one of Japan's rising stars in junior tennis.\n\n2008 marked Doi's first participation in senior [[ITF Women's Circuit]] events. She partnered with Kurumi Nara again for the 2008 ITF event in Miyazaki, where they upset top-seeded sisters [[Erika Sema|Erika]] and [[Yurika Sema]] 3\u20136, 6\u20133, [10\u20136] in the second round. Doi and Nara went on to triumph over [[Kimiko Date-Krumm]] and [[Tomoko Yonemura]] in the finals.\n\n==Professional career==\n===2006\u201309: Debut ITF appearance, First ITF title, debut at the qualifers on WTA Tour===\nDoi officially turned pro in June 2006, at the age of 15.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/314237/misaki-doi/matches|title=Matches|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2009, she focused primarily on Japanese tournaments, where she earned two first-place and two second-place finishes in singles and one second-place result in doubles.

Her performance in 2009's events lifted Doi from a year-opening ranking of No. 613 to a year-end mark of No. 199 and a place among the top 10-players in Japanese tennis.\n\n===2010: First Grand Slam qualification-appearance===\nIn 2010, Doi began playing professional tournaments outside Japan. She appeared in the women's singles qualifiers for that year's [[2010 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. Doi then made appearances at several circuit tournaments, placing second in singles at Irapuato, Mexico in March. In doubles, she recorded three second-place finishes in as many weeks in April tournaments at Incheon, Gimhae, and Changwon, South Korea, with partner [[Junri Namigata]].

She is left-handed and uses a two-handed [[backhand]]. Her highest [[WTA rankings]] are 30 in singles and 78 in doubles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/314237/misaki-doi|title=Misaki Doi|publisher=[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]}}</ref> \n\nDoi reached two junior [[grand slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles finals \u2013 at [[2007 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Girls' Doubles|Wimbledon]] in 2007 with [[Kurumi Nara]], and at the [[2008 Australian Open \u2013 Girls' Doubles|Australian Open]] in 2008, with [[Elena Bogdan]] (losing both). She has made it to three WTA tournament finals (only winning one). She is managed by Muse Group, a sports marketing agency based in Tokyo.\n\n==Junior career==\nDoi began playing tennis at the age of three. She first distinguished herself in tennis as a middle-school student, reaching the semifinals of the All Japan Middle School Tennis Championships in both 2004 and 2006 and joining the [[ITF Junior Circuit]] in 2006. In 2007, while enrolled as a freshman in Sundai K\u014dei High School, Doi earned second place in the Japan Open Junior Championships in [[Nagoya]].\n\nA highlight of Doi's junior career was her successful doubles partnership with age-mate [[Kurumi Nara]]. They placed second in girls' doubles at the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships]], becoming only the second Japanese pair to reach the finals of a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] juniors event since [[Yuka Yoshida]] and [[Hiroko Mochizuki]] at the [[1993 US Open (tennis)|1993 US Open]]. Doi and Nara continued their run by advancing to the girls' doubles semifinals at a number of high-profile tournaments, such as the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]] and [[Wimbledon 2008]]. Doi also teamed with Romanian [[Elena Bogdan]] to place second in girls' doubles at the [[2008 Australian Open]]. This flurry of successes catapulted Doi to No. 3 in Japan's under-18 tennis rankings for 2007; she had been recognized early on as one of Japan's rising stars in junior tennis.\n\n2008 marked Doi's first participation in senior [[ITF Women's Circuit]] events. She partnered with Kurumi Nara again for the 2008 ITF event in Miyazaki, where they upset top-seeded sisters [[Erika Sema|Erika]] and [[Yurika Sema]] 3\u20136, 6\u20133, [10\u20136] in the second round. Doi and Nara went on to triumph over [[Kimiko Date-Krumm]] and [[Tomoko Yonemura]] in the finals.\n\n==Professional career==\n===2006\u201309: Debut ITF appearance, First ITF title, debut at the qualifers on WTA Tour===\nDoi officially turned pro in June 2006, at the age of 15.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/314237/misaki-doi/matches|title=Matches|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2009, she focused primarily on Japanese tournaments, where she earned two first-place and two second-place finishes in singles and one second-place result in doubles. In March 2009, she won her first ITF title in $10,000 Kofu, Japan. In October, she made her tour debut in the qualifiers of the [[HP Open]], falling to American [[Abigail Spears]] in the second qualifying round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/en/tournament/osaka/jpn/2009/w-int-jpn-01a-2009/draws-and-results/|title=2009 HP Open|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Doi was seeded sixth in the women's singles draw of November's All Japan Tennis Championships. She lost in straight sets to [[Akiko Morigami]] in the round of 16. Her performance in 2009's events lifted Doi from a year-opening ranking of No. 613 to a year-end mark of No. 199 and a place among the top 10-players in Japanese tennis.\n\n===2010: First Grand Slam qualification-apperance===\nIn 2010, Doi began playing professional tournaments outside Japan. She appeared in the women's singles qualifiers for that year's [[2010 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. Doi then made appearances at several circuit tournaments, placing second in singles at Irapuato, Mexico in March. In doubles, she recorded three second-place finishes in as many weeks in April tournaments at Incheon, Gimhae, and Changwon, South Korea, with partner [[Junri Namigata]]. With new partner [[Kotomi Takahata]], Doi won her first $50,000 ITF title in doubles at the [[Fukuoka International Women's Cup|Fukuoka tournament]] in May, defeating [[Marina Erakovic]] and [[Alexandra Panova]] in straight sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/en/tournament/$50000-fukuoka/jpn/2010/w-witf-jpn-04a-2010/draws-and-results/|title=$50,000 Fukuoka (2010)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHer success continued in the qualifying rounds of the [[2010 French Open|French Open]], where she defeated [[Mandy Minella]] and upset [[Michelle Larcher de Brito]] to reach the qualifier finals.

She went on to defeat [[Zheng Jie]] before losing in the third round to [[Sabine Lisicki]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/en/tournament/wimbledon/gbr/2011/w-sl-gbr-01a-2011/draws-and-results/|title=2011 Wimbledon|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===2012: First quarter-final on the WTA Tour===\nThe [[Aegon Classic]] was Doi's first appearance in the quarter-finals of a singles tour event, which she reached by defeating the top seed [[Francesca Schiavone]] in two sets. Although Doi lost in the [[2012 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] qualifiers to [[Kristina Mladenovic]], she received a [[lucky loser]] berth in the main tournament. She was defeated by her first-round opponent [[Arantxa Rus]].\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the main draws of the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and Toray Pan Pacific Open, Doi found success at the HP Open, where she defeated [[Chanelle Scheepers]] in three sets to reach her first tour semi-final.\n\n===2013: Main-draw appearance at all Grand Slams ===\n2013 marked the first year in which Doi qualified for all four Grand Slam tournaments. In the [[2013 Australian Open|Australian Open]], she reached the second round after a 6\u20133, 6\u20134 victory over [[Petra Marti\u0107]] before losing 0\u20136, 0\u20136 to [[Maria Sharapova]]. She lost in the first round in the other three Grand Slam events. At the [[2013 French Open|French Open]] she faced [[Madison Keys]]; at [[Wimbledon 2013|Wimbledon]] [[S\u00edlvia Soler Espinosa]]; and at the [[2013 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] [[Petra Kvitov\u00e1]].\n\n===2016: Best Ranking so far, Reaching the last 15 of Wimbledon===\nAt the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Doi played the seventh seed [[Angelique Kerber]] in the first round, winning the first set and holding a match point in the second-set tie-break before eventually losing in three sets. Kerber went on to win the title. On 16 May, she achieved a new career-high ranking of 38 after a quarter-final appearance in [[2016 Italian Open (tennis)|Rome]]. Doi then competed at the [[2016 Aegon Classic Birmingham|Aegon Classic]], losing to [[Johanna Konta]]. Doi reached the last 16 of [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], beating [[Louisa Chirico]], [[Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1]] and [[Anna-Lena Friedsam]] before losing to Kerber in straight sets. She was the first Japanese player to reach the fourth round of the ladies draw since [[Ai Sugiyama]] ten years earlier.\n\n==Personal==\nDoi is coached by Christian Zahalka since April 2015. Her most admired players are [[Justine Henin]] and [[Shingo Kunieda]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/314237/misaki-doi/bio|title=Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> She uses a [[Srixon]] racquet and [[ASICS]] shoes, prefers to play on [[hardcourt|hard courts]], and favors her [[forehand]] and [[Serve (tennis)|serve]]. \n\n==Performance timelines==\n{{Performance key}}\n===Singles===\n''Only main-draw results in WTA Tour, Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic Games are included in Win\u2013Loss records.''\n\n''This table is current through the [[2019 China Open - Women's Singles|2019 China Open]].''\n{|class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

With the 1963 Corvette C2 design locked down, in 1961 as a [[concept car|concept]] for future [[Chevrolet Corvette]] the groundwork for the XP-755 was laid down. Building on the design of the 1958 XP-700 \"double bubble\", the XP-755 added design elements of the soon to be released C2 Corvette. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired by the sleek, fast-moving [[shortfin mako shark]]. The '61 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The concept was also inspired by Bill Mitchell's 1959 [[Corvette Stingray (concept car)|Stingray racer]] XP-87 which also influenced the 1963 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Corvette Sting Ray]].\n\nThe Mako Shark debuted at the New York Coliseum at the 1962 6th [[New York International Auto Show|International Automobile Show]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The '60s at 50 |url=http://the60sat50.blogspot.com/2012/04/april-1962-new-york-auto-show.html |website=April 1962: New York Auto Show |accessdate=29 March 2020 |date=26 April 2012}}</ref> and the car was a success on the auto show circuit. With many of the Mako's design elements making into production on future Covettes, it was successful in building hype for the forthcoming next generation of Corvette.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |title=1961 (Mako) Shark XP-755 |url=https://www.corvettes.nl/gm_prototypes/xp755/index.html |website=Remarkable Corvettes |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike many show cars, the Mako Shark underwent styling and detail changes over time. The hood and front facia were modified and the interior was updated. The car also lost the distinctive \"double-bubble\" canopy. The car was retroactively dubbed the Mako Shark I when the Mako Shark II debuted. The car now resides in the GM Heritage Collection.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nAn apocryphal story has it that Mitchell had an actual mako shark mounted on the wall in his office, and ordered his team to paint the car to match the distinctive blue-gray upper surface blending into the white underside of the fish. After numerous attempts to match the shark's  color scheme failed, the team hit upon the idea of kidnapping the fish one night, painting it to match their best efforts on the car, and returning it to the office. Mitchell never realized the difference and pronounced himself pleased with the team's duplication of nature's handiwork on the car.<ref>[http://www.corvetteactioncenter.com/specs/prototypes/mako1.html Mako Shark I: Interview with Larry Shinoda]</ref>\n\n[[Charles M.

Chevrolet created two of them - only one of which was fully functional. The non-running show car sported futuristic details, such as square section side pipes and a squared-off steering wheel. This car debuted at the 1965 New York Auto Show. The second running show-car made its debut at the 1965 [[Paris Motor Show]] with more conventional steering wheel and exhaust. The car did have a retractable rear spoiler, and a square section bumper that could be extended for added protection.

Hot rodder and customizer Joe Silva was one of those, and used his skills to create a fiberglass kit to transform the C3 Corvette into road-going Mako Shark. Joel Rosen of Baldwin-Motion supercar performance fame added his mechanical expertise to the project, bringing the Phase III GT performance package (and some re-engineering of the kit) to Silva's fiberglass body. In order to avoid legal issues with GM, they changed the name of their product to \"Maco Shark\". Silva created the fiberglass panels and basic components, while Rosen handled the mechanical, chassis and suspension upgrades along with marketing.

With the 1963 Corvette C2 desing locked down, in 1961 as a [[concept car|concept]] for future [[Chevrolet Corvette]] the groundwork for the XP-755 was laid down. Building on the design of the 1958 XP-700 \"double bubble\", the XP-755 added design elements of the soon to be released C2 Corvette. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired by the sleek, fast-moving [[shortfin mako shark]]. The '61 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The concept was also inspired by Bill Mitchell's 1959 [[Corvette Stingray (concept car)|Stingray racer]] XP-87 which also influenced the 1963 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Corvette Sting Ray]].\n\nThe Mako Shark debuted at the New York Coliseum at the 1962 6th [[New York International Auto Show|International Automobile Show]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The '60s at 50 |url=http://the60sat50.blogspot.com/2012/04/april-1962-new-york-auto-show.html |website=April 1962: New York Auto Show |accessdate=29 March 2020 |date=26 April 2012}}</ref> and the car was a success on the auto show circuit.

The hood and front facia were modified and the interior was updated. The car also lost the distinctive \"double-bubble\" canopy. The car was retroactively dubbed the Mako Shark I when the Mako Shark II debuted. The car now resides in the GM Heritage Collection.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nA apocryphal story has it that Mitchell had an actual mako shark mounted on the wall in his office, and ordered his team to paint the car to match the distinctive blue-gray upper surface blending into the white underside of the fish. After numerous attempts to match the shark's  color scheme failed, the team hit upon the idea of kidnapping the fish one night, painting it to match their best efforts on the car, and returning it to the office.

In this short time, the festival became one of the biggest music events in [[Yugoslavia]]. Skopjefest was the place where famous Macedonian singers such as [[Slave Dimitrov]], Zafir Hadzimanov, Nina Spirova made their performances together with eminent [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] performers. Audiences enjoyed over 50 songs.\n\nAfter Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from [[Yugoslavia]], SkopjeFest was revived in 1994, and has since taken over from [[MakFest]] as North Macedonia's premier music festival.\n\nThe show involves some of North Macedonia's finest performers, singing original tracks submitted to MRT (Makedonska Radio Televizija), usually accompanied by the orchestra of MRT (excluding some of its latest editions).\n\nIt has also been used as the Macedonian national selections for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], since the late 1990s. The first Macedonian representative in Eurovision, was Macedonian singer [[Vlado Janevski]] who won SkopjeFest 1998 with the song \"Ne Zori Zoro\", for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]]. This was Macedonia's first participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Ever since, SkopjeFest has been shadowed by many controversial debates regarding the strategies behind the song selections and the lack of transparence concerning the winner. Such allegations are not new to this contest. However, they intensified as the Eurovision participation became a factor. After the decision to make SkopjeFest the National Pre-Selection round for Macedonia's representative to Eurovision, the traditional point award ceremony was eliminated and replaced by the controversial announcement of only the Top 3 places. Neither the points of the jury nor the televoting results are made public.\n\nUp until 2002, SkopjeFest used to be the biggest musical activity in the country. However, it faced financial problems.

In this short time, the festival became one of the biggest music events in [[Yugoslavia]]. Skopjefest was the place where famous Macedonian singers such as [[Slave Dimitrov]], Zafir Hadzimanov, Nina Spirova made their performances together with eminent [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] performers. Audiences enjoyed over 50 songs.\n\nAfter Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from [[Yugoslavia]], SkopjeFest was revived in 1994, and has since taken over from [[MakFest]] as North Macedonia's premier music festival.\n\nThe show involves some of North Macedonia's finest performers, singing original tracks submitted to MRT (Makedonska Radio Televizija), usually accompanied by the orchestra of MRT (excluding some of its latest editions).\n\nIt has also been used as the Macedonian national selections for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], since the late 1990s. The first Macedonian representative in Eurovision, was Macedonian singer [[Vlado Janevski]] who won SkopjeFest 1998 with the song \"Ne Zori Zoro\", for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]]. This was Macedonia's first participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Ever since, SkopjeFest has been shadowed by many controversial debates regarding the strategies behind the song selections and the lack of transparence concerning the winner. Such allegations are not new to this contest. However, they intensified as the Eurovision participation became a factor. After the decision to make SkopjeFest the National Pre-Selection round for Macedonia's representative to Eurovision, the traditional point award ceremony was eliminated and replaced by the controversial announcement of only the Top 3 places. Neither the points of the jury nor the televoting results are made public.\n\nUp until 2002, SkopjeFest used to be the biggest musical activity in the country. However, it faced financial problems. In 2003, the festival wasn't held in order to save money for the next year when Macedonia was going to particate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. In the meantime, MRT made new criteria for the national selection for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], the festival returned in 2004 only to celebrate the 60th anniversary of MRT.
