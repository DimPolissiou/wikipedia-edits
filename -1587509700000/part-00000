As in many other colonial societies around the world, ''[[Creole people|creole]]'' was a term used to mean those who were \"native-born\", especially native-born Europeans such as the French and Spanish.

People of any race or ethnicity can and have identified as Creoles, and it is a misconception that ''cr\u00e9olit\u00e9\u2014''the quality of being Creole''\u2014''implies mixed racial origins. In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the class of [[free people of color]] in Louisiana became associated with the term Creole and further identification with mixed race took place during the interwar period in the 20th century. One historian has described this period as the \"Americanization of Creoles,\" including an acceptance of the American binary racial system that divided Creoles into those who identified as mostly white and others as mostly black. (See [[Creoles of color]].)\n\n''Cr\u00e9ole'' was used casually as an identity in the 1700s in Louisiana. Starting in the very early 1800s in Louisiana, after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase, the term \"Creole\" began to take on a more political meaning and identity, especially for those persons of Latinate culture. These generally Catholic French speakers had a culture that contrasted with the [[Protestant]] English-speaking and Anglo culture of the new American settlers from the Upper South and the North.  \n\nIn the early 19th century, amid the [[Haitian Revolution]], thousands of refugees (both whites and free people of color from [[Saint-Domingue]] ([[affranchi]]s or [[gens de couleur libres]]) arrived in New Orleans, often bringing enslaved Africans with them. So many refugees arrived that the city's population doubled. As more refugees were allowed in Louisiana, Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived. These groups had strong influences on the city and its culture. Half of the white \u00e9migr\u0117 population of Haiti settled in Louisiana, especially in the greater New Orleans area. Later 19th-century immigrants to New Orleans, such as [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[German Americans|Germans]] and [[Italian Americans|Italians]], also married into the Creole groups. Most of the new immigrants were also Catholic.\n\nThere was also a sizable German Creole group of full German descent, centering on the parishes of St. Charles and St. John the Baptist. (It is for these settlers that the [[Des Allemands, Louisiana|C\u00f4te des Allemands]], literally \"The German Coast,\" is named.) Over time, many of these groups assimilated, in part or completely, into the dominant French Creole culture, often adopting the French language and customs. \n\nAlthough [[Cajuns]] are often presented in the twenty-first century as a group distinct from the Creoles, many historical accounts exist wherein persons with [[Acadian]] surnames either self-identify or are identified by others as being Creole, and some nineteenth century sources make specific references to \"Acadian Creoles.\" As people born in colonial Louisiana, people of Acadian ancestry could and can be referred to as Creole, and until the early-mid twentieth century Cajuns were considered a subcategory of Louisiana Creole rather than a wholly separate group. Today, however, some Louisianans who identify as Cajun reject association as Creole, while others may embrace both identities. \n\nCreoles of French descent, including those descended from the Acadians, have historically made up the majority of white Creoles in Louisiana. Louisiana Creoles are mostly Catholic in religion. Throughout the 19th century, most Creoles spoke French and were strongly connected to French colonial culture.<ref name=\"more than Cajun\">Christophe Landry, [http://www.francolouisiane.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=56&lang=en \"Primer on Francophone Louisiana: more than Cajun\"], \"francolouisiane.com\", accessed October 19, 2011</ref> The sizeable [[Isle\u00f1os in Louisiana|Spanish Creole communities]] of [[Saint Bernard Parish]] and [[Galveztown, Louisiana|Galveztown]] spoke Spanish. The Malague\u00f1os of New Iberia spoke Spanish as well. The Isle\u00f1os and Malague\u00f1os were Louisiana-born whites of Creole heritage. (Since the mid-20th century, however, the number of Spanish-speaking Creoles has declined in favor of English speakers, and few people under 80 years old speak Spanish.) They have maintained cultural traditions from the [[Canary Islands]], where their immigrant ancestors came from.<ref name=\"Tradici\u00f3n Hispano - Canaria\">[[Samuel G. Armistead|G.

Ed: First Edition, March 2007.</ref> However, just as with the Spanish Creoles, native languages of all Creole groups, whether French, Spanish or German, have declined over the years in favor of the English spoken by the majority of the population. The different varieties of Louisiana's Creoles shaped the state's culture, particularly in the southern areas around New Orleans and the plantation districts. Louisiana is known as the Creole State.<ref name=\"more than Cajun\" />\n\nWhile the sophisticated Creole society of New Orleans, which centered mainly on white Creoles, such as the French Creole, has historically received much attention, the [[Cane River]] area in northwest Louisiana, populated chiefly by [[Creoles of color]], also developed its own strong Creole culture. Other enclaves of Creole culture have been located in south and southwest Louisiana: [[Frilot Cove]], [[Bois Mallet]], [[Grand Marais, Louisiana|Grand Marais]], Palmetto, Lawtell, Soileau and others. These communities have had a long history of cultural independence. \n\nNew Orleans also has had a significant historical population of Creoles of color as well, a group that was mostly [[free people of color]], of mixed European, African, and Native American descent. Another area where many creoles can be found is within the River Parishes: St. Charles, St. John, and St. James. Many white Creoles of German and French descent have also settled there. Most white Creoles are found in the greater New Orleans region, a seven parish-wide Creole cultural area including Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Charles, St. Tammany and St. John the Baptist parishes. Also, Avoyelles and Evangeline parishes in [[Acadiana]] also have large white creole populations of French descent, also known as French Creoles.\n\n==History==\n\n===1st French period===\n{{Main|Louisiana (New France)}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|right|340px|Map of [[North America]] in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (part of the international [[Seven Years' War]] (1756 to 1763)). Possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange).]]\n\nThrough both the French and Spanish (late 18th century) regimes, parochial and colonial governments used the term Creole for ethnic French and Spanish born in the New World as opposed to Europe. Parisian French was the predominant language among colonists in early New Orleans.\n\nLater the regional French evolved to contain local phrases and slang terms. The French Creoles spoke what became known as [[Colonial French]]. Because of isolation, the language in the colony developed differently from that in France. It was spoken by the ethnic French and Spanish and their Creole descendants.\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of Louisiana Creole today is a person descended from ancestors in Louisiana before the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States in 1803.<ref name=\"Managan\"/>  An estimated 7,000 European immigrants settled in Louisiana during the 18th century, one percent of the number of British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies along the Atlantic coast. Louisiana attracted considerably fewer French colonists than did its West Indian colonies. After the crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which lasted more than two months, the colonists had numerous challenges ahead of them in the Louisiana frontier. Their living conditions were difficult: uprooted, they had to face a new, often hostile, environment, with difficult climate and tropical diseases. Many of these immigrants died during the maritime crossing or soon after their arrival.\n\n[[Hurricane]]s, unknown in France, periodically struck the coast, destroying whole villages. The [[Mississippi Delta]] was plagued with periodic [[yellow fever]] epidemics. Europeans also brought the Eurasian diseases of [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], which flourished along with mosquitoes and poor sanitation. These conditions slowed colonization. Moreover, French villages and forts were not always sufficient to protect from enemy offensives. Attacks by Native Americans represented a real threat to the groups of isolated colonists. The [[Natchez people|Natchez]] killed 250 colonists in Lower Louisiana in retaliation for encroachment by the Europeans. The Natchez warriors took [[Fort Rosalie]] (now [[Natchez, Mississippi]]) by surprise, killing many individuals. During the next two years, the French attacked the Natchez in return, causing them to flee or, when captured, be [[deportation|deported]] as slaves to their Caribbean colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (later [[Haiti]]).\n\n====Casket girls====\nAside from French government representatives and soldiers, colonists included mostly young men who were recruited in French ports or in Paris. Some served as [[indentured servant]]s; they were required to remain in Louisiana for a length of time, fixed by the contract of service, to pay back the cost of passage and board. During this time, they were \"temporary semi-slaves\". To increase the colonial population, the government recruited young Frenchwomen, known as ''[[Casquette girl|filles \u00e0 la cassette]]'' (in English, ''casket girls'', referring to the casket or case of belongings they brought with them) to go to the colony to be wed to colonial soldiers. The king financed dowries for each girl. (This practice was similar to events in  17th-century Quebec: about 800 ''[[filles du roi]]'' (daughters of the king) were recruited to immigrate to [[New France]] under the monetary sponsorship of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].)\n\nIn addition, French authorities deported some female criminals to the colony.  For example, in 1721, the ship ''La Baleine'' brought close to 90 women of childbearing age from the prison of [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital|La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]] in Paris to Louisiana. Most of the women quickly found husbands among the male residents of the colony. These women, many of whom were most likely [[prostitutes]] or felons, were known as ''The Baleine Brides''.<ref>''National Genealogical Society Quarterly,'' December 1987; vol.75, number 4: \"The Baleine Brides: A Missing Ship's Roll for Louisiana\"</ref> Such events inspired ''[[Manon Lescaut]]'' (1731), a novel written by the [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]], which was later adapted as an opera in the 19th century.\n\nHistorian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that casket girls (considered among the ancestors of French Creoles) were transported to Louisiana. (The Ursuline order of nuns, who were said to chaperone the girls until they married, have denied the casket girl myth as well.) Martin suggests this account was mythical. The system of [[pla\u00e7age]] that continued into the 19th century resulted in many young white men having women of color as partners and mothers of their children, often before or even after their marriages to white women.<ref>Joan M. Martin, ''Pla\u00e7age and the Louisiana Gens de Couleur Libre,'' in [[Louisiana Creole|Creole]], edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.</ref> French Louisiana also included communities of Swiss and German settlers; however, royal authorities did not refer to \"Louisianans\" but described the colonial population as \"French\" citizens.\n\n===Spanish period===\n{{Main|Louisiana (New Spain)}}\nThe [[Louisiana (New France)|French colony]] was ceded to Spain in the secret [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)]], in the final stages of the [[Seven Years' War]], which took place on two continents. The Spanish were slow and reluctant to fully occupy the colony, however, and did not do so until 1769. That year Spain abolished Indian slavery. In addition, Spanish liberal [[manumission]] policies contributed to the growth of the population of Creoles of Color, particularly in New Orleans. Nearly all of the surviving 18th-century [[architecture]] of the Vieux Carr\u00e9 ([[French Quarter]]) dates from the Spanish period (the Ursuline Convent an exception). These buildings were designed by French architects, as there were no Spanish architects in Louisiana. The buildings of the French Quarter are of a Mediterranean style also found in southern France.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title=National Park Service. Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings.

By the end of the 18th century, many mixed-race Creoles had gained education and tended to work in artisan or skilled trades; a relatively high number were property and slave owners. The Louisiana Creole language developed primarily from the influence of French and African languages, enabling slaves from different tribes and colonists to communicate.\n\n===2nd French period and Louisiana Purchase===\n[[File:Painting of Creole Woman and Boy by Anna Maria Von Phul.jpg|thumb|Painting of Creole Woman and Boy by [[Anna Maria von Phul]], 1818]]\nSpain ceded Louisiana back to France in 1800 through the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the [[United States]] in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, following defeat of his forces in Saint-Domingue. He had been trying to regain control of the island colony following a multi-year slave rebellion.\n\nThousands of refugees from the revolution, both [[White people|whites]] and ''affranchis'' or ''Gens de Couleur Libres'', arrived in New Orleans, often bringing their [[Africa]]n [[slaves]] with them. These groups had a strong influence on the city, increasing the number of French speakers, Africans with strong traditional customs, and Creoles of Color. The [[Haitian Revolution]] ended in the slaves gaining independence in 1804, establishing the second [[republic]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and the first republic led by [[black people]]. While Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne|Claiborne]] and other officials wanted to keep out additional [[free black]] men, the French Creoles wanted to increase the [[French language|French]]-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed in Louisiana, Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived.<ref name=\"AAM\"/> Many of the white [[Francophones]] had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for [[Bonapartist]] schemes in [[Spain]].<ref>''The Bourgeois Frontier : French Towns, French Traders and American Expansion,'' by Jay Gitlin (2009). Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10118-8}}, pg 54</ref> After the Purchase, many Americans were also migrating to Louisiana. Later European immigrants included Irish, Germans, and Italians.\n\nDuring the antebellum years, the major [[commodity crops]] were [[sugar cane|sugar]] and [[cotton]], cultivated on large plantations along the Mississippi River outside the city with [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. Plantations were developed in the French style, with narrow waterfronts for access on the river, and long plots running back inland.\n\nNearly 90 percent of early 19th century immigrants to the territory settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration from Cuba brought 2,731 whites; 3,102 ''Gens de Couleur Libres''; and 3,226 enslaved persons of African descent, which in total doubled the city's population. The city became 63 percent black in population, a greater proportion than [[Charleston, South Carolina]]'s 53 percent.<ref name=\"AAM\">[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=5&topic=3 \"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries\"], ''In Motion: African American Migration Experience,'' New York Public Library, accessed 7 May 2008</ref>\n\nThe transfer of the French colony to the United States and the arrival of Anglo-Americans from New England and the South resulted in a cultural confrontation. Some Americans were reportedly shocked by aspects of the culture and French-speaking society of the newly acquired territory: the predominance of the French language and Roman Catholicism, the free class of mixed-race people, and the strong African traditions of enslaved peoples. They pressured the United States' first governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]], [[William C. C. Claiborne|W.C.C. Claiborne]], to change it.\n\nParticularly in the slave society of the [[Southern United States|South]], slavery had become a racial caste. Since the late 17th century, children in the colonies took the status of their mothers at birth; therefore, all children of enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of the race or status of their fathers. This produced many mixed-race slaves over the generations. Whites classified society into whites and blacks (the latter associated strongly with slaves). Although there was a growing population of [[free people of color]], particularly in the Upper South, they generally did not have the same rights and freedoms as [[Creoles of Color]] in Louisiana under French and Spanish rule, who held office in some cases and served in the militia. For example, around 80 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that fought in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Battle of Baton Rouge]] in 1779.<ref>Charles Gayarr\u00e9, ''History of Louisiana: The Spanish domination'', William J. Widdleton, 1867, pp 126-132</ref> And 353 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that fought in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1812.<ref>[http://www.wcny.org/education/war-of-1812/the-battle-of-new-orleans-treaty-of-ghent/ \"The Battle of New Orleans\"], wcny.org, Accessed September 1, 2016</ref> Later on, some of the descendants of these Creole of Color veterans of the Battle of New Orleans, like [[Caesar Antoine]], went on to fight in the [[American Civil War]].\n\nWhen Claiborne made English the official language of the territory, the French Creoles of New Orleans were outraged, and reportedly paraded in protest in the streets. They rejected the Americans' effort to transform them overnight. In addition, upper-class French Creoles thought that many of the arriving Americans were uncouth, especially the rough Kentucky boatmen (Kaintucks) who regularly visited the city, having maneuvered flatboats down the Mississippi River filled with goods for market.\n\nRealizing that he needed local support, Claiborne restored French as an official language. In all forms of government, public forums, and in the [[Catholic Church]], French continued to be used. Most importantly, [[Louisiana French]] and Louisiana Creole remained the languages of the majority of the population of the state, leaving English and Spanish as minority languages.\n\n==Ethnic blend and race==\n{{further|Creoles of color}}\n\n[[File:Adah Isaacs Menken, age 19, 1854-55.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Adah Isaacs Menken]], Creole actress, painter and poet]]\nColonists referred to themselves and enslaved Black people who were native-born as creole, to distinguish them from new arrivals from France and Spain as well as Africa.<ref name=\"Managan\"/> [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], such as the [[Creek people]], intermixed with Creoles also, making three races present in the ethnic group.\n\nLike \"Cajun,\" the term \"Creole\" is a popular name used to describe cultures in the southern Louisiana area. \"Creole\" can be roughly defined as \"native to a region,\" but its precise meaning varies according to the geographic area in which it is used. Generally, however, Creoles felt the need to distinguish themselves from the influx of American and European immigrants coming into the area after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. \"Creole\" is still used to describe the heritage and customs of the various people who settled Louisiana during the early French colonial times. In addition to the French Canadians, the amalgamated Creole culture in southern Louisiana includes influences from the [[Chitimacha]], [[Houma people|Houma]] and other native tribes, enslaved West Africans, Spanish-speaking [[Isle\u00f1os]] (Canary Islanders) and French-speaking ''[[Gens de couleur|Gens de Couleur Libres]]'' from the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/cultural_diversity/Jean_Lafitte_Historical_Park.html|title=Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve: Places Reflecting America's Diverse Cultures Explore their Stories in the National Park System: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=3 February 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nAs a group, mixed-race Creoles rapidly began to acquire education, skills (many in New Orleans worked as craftsmen and artisans), businesses and property. They were overwhelmingly Catholic, spoke [[Louisiana Colonial French|Colonial French]] (although some also spoke [[Louisiana Creole]]), and kept up many French social customs, modified by other parts of their ancestry and Louisiana culture. The Creoles of Color often [[endogamy|married among themselves]] to maintain their class and social culture. The French-speaking mixed-race population came to be called \"Creoles of color\". It was said that \"New Orleans persons of color were far wealthier, more secure and more established than freed unmixed Black Creoles and Cajuns elsewhere in Louisiana.\"<ref name=\"everyculture.com\"/>\n\nUnder the French and Spanish rulers, Louisiana developed a three-tiered society, similar to that of [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], [[Brazil]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and other Latin colonies. This [[casta|three-tiered society]] included white Creoles; a prosperous, educated group of mixed-race Creoles of European, African and Native American descent; and the far larger class of African and Black Creole slaves. The status of mixed-race Creoles of color (''Gens de Couleur Libres'') was one they guarded carefully. By law they enjoyed most of the same rights and privileges as white Creoles. They could and often did challenge the law in court and won cases against white Creoles. They were property owners and created schools for their children. In many cases though, these different tiers viewed themselves as one group, as other [[Ibero-America|Iberoamerican]] and [[Francophonie|Francophone]] ethnic groups commonly did. Race did not play as central a role as it does in Anglo-American culture: oftentimes, race was not a concern, but instead, family standing and wealth were key distinguishing factors in New Orleans and beyond.<ref name=\"Managan\"/> The Creole civil rights activist [[Rodolphe Desdunes]] explained the difference between Creoles and Anglo-Americans, concerning the widespread belief in [[racialism]] by the latter, as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The groups (Latin and Anglo New Orleaneans) had \"two different schools of politics [and differed] radically ... in aspiration and method. One hopes [Latins], and the other doubts [Anglos]. Thus we often perceive that one makes every effort to acquire merits, the other to gain advantages. One aspires to equality, the other to identity. One will forget that he is a Negro in order to think that he is a man; the other will forget that he is a man to think that he is a Negro.<ref>Christophe Landry, [https://cerebellum1.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/wearing-the-wrong-spectacles-and-catching-the-time-disease/ \"Wearing the wrong spectacles and catching the Time disease!\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014005153/https://cerebellum1.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/wearing-the-wrong-spectacles-and-catching-the-time-disease/ |date=2016-10-14 }}, Accessed August 23, 2016</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the United States acquired the area in the Louisiana Purchase, mixed-race Creoles of Color resisted American attempts to impose their binary racial culture. In the American South slavery had become virtually a racial caste, in which most people of any African descent were considered to be lower in status. The planter society viewed it as a binary culture, with whites and blacks (the latter including everyone other than whites, although for some years they counted mulattos separately on censuses).<ref name=\"Managan\"/>\n\nWhile the American Civil War promised rights and opportunities for the enslaved, the [[Creoles of Color]], who had long been free before the war, worried about losing their identity and position. The Americans did not legally recognize a three-tiered society; nevertheless, some Creoles of Color such as [[Thomy Lafon]], [[Victor S\u00e9jour]] and others, used their position to support the abolitionist cause.<ref>[http://www.theneworleanstribune.com/main/keep-up-the-fight/ \"Keep Up The Fight\"], theneworleanstribune.com, Accessed September 1, 2016</ref> And the Creole of Color, Francis E.

They enforced [[white supremacy]] by passing [[Jim Crow]] laws and a constitution near the turn of the 20th century that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and Creoles of color through discriminatory application of voter registration and electoral laws. Some white Creoles, such as the ex-Confederate general [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Pierre G. T.

It makes use of what is sometimes called the [[Holy trinity (cuisine)|Holy trinity]]: onions, celery and green peppers. It has developed primarily from various European, African, and Native American historic culinary influences. A distinctly different style of Creole or Cajun cooking exists in [[Acadiana]].\n\n[[Gumbo]] (''Gomb\u00f4'' in Louisiana Creole, ''Gombo'' in Louisiana French) is a traditional Creole dish from New Orleans with French, Spanish, Native American, African, German, Italian, and Caribbean influences. It is a roux-based meat stew or soup, sometimes made with some combination of any of the following: seafood (usually shrimp, crabs, with oysters optional, or occasionally crawfish), sausage, chicken (hen or rooster), alligator, turtle, rabbit, duck, deer or wild boar. Gumbo is often seasoned with [[Fil\u00e9 powder|fil\u00e9]], which is dried and ground [[sassafras]] leaves. Both meat and seafood versions also include the \"Holy Trinity\" and are served like stew over rice. It developed from French colonists trying to make ''[[bouillabaisse]]'' with New World ingredients. Starting with aromatic seasonings, the French used onions and celery as in a traditional ''[[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]]'', but lacked [[carrot]]s, so they substituted green bell peppers. Africans contributed [[okra]], traditionally grown in regions of Africa, the [[Middle East]] and Spain. ''Gombo'' is the Louisiana French word for okra, which is derived from a shortened version of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] words ''kilogomb\u00f3'' or ''kigamb\u00f3,'' also ''guingamb\u00f3'' or ''quinbomb\u00f3''. \"Gumbo\" became the anglicized version of the word 'Gombo' after the [[English language]] became dominant in Louisiana. In Louisiana French dialects, the word \"gombo\" still refers to both the hybrid stew and the vegetable. The Choctaw contributed ''fil\u00e9''; the Spanish contributed peppers and tomatoes; and new spices were adopted from Caribbean dishes. The French later favored a ''[[roux]]'' for thickening. In the 19th century, the Italians added [[garlic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} After arriving in numbers, German immigrants dominated New Orleans city bakeries, including those making traditional French bread. They introduced having buttered French bread as a side to eating gumbo, as well as a side of German-style potato salad.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Jambalaya]] is the second of the famous Louisiana Creole dishes. It developed in the European communities of New Orleans. It combined ham with sausage, rice and tomato as a variation of the Spanish dish ''[[paella]],'' and was based on locally available ingredients. The name for jambalaya comes from the [[Occitan]] language spoken in southern France, where it means \"mash-up.\" The term also refers to a type of rice cooked with chicken.\n\nToday, jambalaya is commonly made with [[seafood]] (usually [[shrimp]]) or [[chicken]], or a combination of [[shrimp]] and [[chicken]]. Most versions contain [[smoked sausage]], more commonly used instead of [[ham]] in modern versions. However, a version of jambalaya that uses [[ham]] with [[shrimp]] may be closer to the original Creole dish.<ref>Jambalaya.\" Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, John F. Mariani, Bloomsbury, 2nd edition, 2014. Credo Reference, https://login.avoserv2.library.fordham.edu/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/bloomfood/jambalaya/0?institutionId=3205. Accessed 23 Oct. 2019.\n</ref>\n\nJambalaya is prepared in two ways: \"red\" and \"brown\". Red is the [[tomato]]-based version native to New Orleans; it is also found in parts of Iberia and St. Martin parishes, and generally uses shrimp or chicken stock. The red-style Creole jambalaya is the original version. The \"brown\" version is associated with Cajun cooking and does not include tomatoes.\n\nRed beans and rice is a dish of Louisiana and Caribbean influence, originating in New Orleans. It contains red beans, the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery, and bell pepper, and often ''[[andouille]]'' smoked sausage, pickled pork, or smoked ham hocks. The beans are served over white rice. It is one of the famous dishes in Louisiana, and is associated with \"washday Monday\". It could be cooked all day over a low flame while the women of the house attended to washing the family's clothes.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Creole music}}\n[[File:CreoleGirlsPlaquemines1935.jpg|right|thumb|Creole women, [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana]]\" (1935 photo by [[Ben Shahn]])]]\n''[[Zydeco]]'' (a transliteration in English of 'zaric\u00f4' (snapbeans) from the song, \"Les haricots sont pas sal\u00e9s\"), was born in black Creole communities on the prairies of southwest Louisiana in the 1920s. It is often considered the Creole music of Louisiana. Zydeco, a derivative of Cajun music, purportedly hails from ''L\u00e0-l\u00e0,'' a genre of music now defunct, and old south Louisiana ''jur\u00e9s.''  As [[Louisiana French]] and Louisiana Creole was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the prairies of southwest Louisiana, zydeco was initially sung only in Louisiana French or Creole. Later, Louisiana Creoles, such as the 20th-century Ch\u00e9nier brothers, Andrus Espree (Beau Jocque), [[Rosie Ledet|Rosie L\u00e9det]] and others began incorporating a more bluesy sound and added a new linguistic element to zydeco music: English.  Today, zydeco musicians sing in English, Louisiana Creole or Colonial Louisiana French.\n\nToday's Zydeco often incorporates a blend of [[swamp pop]], [[blues]], and/or [[jazz]] as well as \"Cajun Music\" (originally called Old Louisiana French Music).  An instrument unique to zydeco is a form of washboard called the ''[[vest frottoir|frottoir]]'' or scrub board. This is a vest made of corrugated aluminum, and played by the musician working bottle openers, bottle caps or spoons up and down the length of the vest.  Another instrument used in both Zydeco and Cajun music since the 1800s is the accordion. Zydeco music makes use of the piano or button accordion while Cajun music is played on the diatonic accordion, or Cajun accordion, often called a \"squeeze box\".  Cajun musicians also use the fiddle and steel guitar more often than do those playing Zydeco.\n\nZydeco can be traced to the music of enslaved African people from the 19th century. It is represented in ''[[Slave Songs of the United States]],'' first published in 1867. The final seven songs in that work are printed with melody along with text in Louisiana Creole. These and many other songs were sung by slaves on plantations, especially in [[St. Charles Parish]], and when they gathered on Sundays at [[Congo Square]] in New Orleans.\n\nAmong the Spanish Creole people highlights, between their varied traditional folklore, the Canarian [[D\u00e9cimas]], [[Romance (music)|romances]], [[ballads]] and pan-Hispanic songs date back many years, even to the [[Medieval Age]]. This folklore was carried by their ancestors from the Canary Islands to Louisiana in the 18th century. It also highlights their adaptation to the [[Isle\u00f1os in Louisiana|Isle\u00f1o]] music to other music outside of the community (especially from the Mexican [[Corridos]]).<ref name=\"Tradici\u00f3n Hispano - Canaria\"/>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Louisiana French|Louisiana Creole}}\n[[File:Louisiana French 19th century document 2.png|thumb|right|19th-century newspaper clipping from Thibodaux, LA]]\n\nLouisiana Creole (''Kr\u00e9yol La Lwizy\u00e0n'') is a [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] <ref>\"Louisiana Creole Dictionary\", www.LouisianaCreoleDictionary.com Website, accessed 15 July 2014</ref> language spoken by the Louisiana Creole people and sometimes Cajuns and Anglo-residents of the state of [[Louisiana]].

Also during the '40s and '50s many Creoles left Louisiana to find work in Texas, mostly in Houston and East Texas. The language and music is widely spoken there;  the 5th ward of Houston was originally called Frenchtown due to that reason.  There were also Zydeco clubs started in Houston, like the famed Silver Slipper owned by a Creole named Alfred Cormier that has hosted the likes of Clifton Chenier and Boozoo Chavais.\n\nOn the other hand, Spanish usage has fallen markedly over the years among the Spanish Creoles. Still, in the first half of twentieth century, most of the people of Saint Bernard and [[Galveztown, Louisiana|Galveztown]] spoke the Spanish language with the [[Canarian Spanish]] dialect (the ancestors of these Creoles were from the [[Canary Islands]]) of the 18th century, but the government of Louisiana imposed the use of English in these communities, especially in the schools (e.g. Saint Bernard) where if a teacher heard children speaking Spanish she would fine them and punish them. Now, only some people over the age of 80 can speak Spanish in these communities. Most of the youth of Saint Bernard can only speak English.<ref name=\"Tradici\u00f3n Hispano - Canaria\"/>\n\n===New Orleans Mardi Gras===\n{{Main|New Orleans Mardi Gras}}\n[[File:MardiGrasCanalStreet1890sChartresGazebo.jpg|thumb|left|[[New Orleans Mardi Gras]] in the early 1890s]]\nMardi Gras (Fat Tuesday in [[English language|English]]) in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], is a [[Carnival]] celebration well known throughout the world. It has colonial French roots.\n\nThe New Orleans Carnival season, with roots in preparing for the start of the [[Christianity|Christian]] season of [[Lent]], starts after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (January 6). It is a season of [[parade]]s, [[ball (dance)|balls]] (some of them [[masquerade ball]]s) and [[king cake]] parties. It has traditionally been part of the winter social season; at one time \"coming out\" parties for young women at d\u00e9butante balls were timed for this season.\n\nCelebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through [[Fat Tuesday]] (''Mardi Gras'' in French), the day before [[Ash Wednesday]]. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the season. In the final week of Carnival, many events large and small occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities.\n\nThe parades in New Orleans are organized by Carnival ''[[krewe]]s''. Krewe [[float (parade)|float]] riders toss ''throws'' to the crowds; the most common throws are strings of plastic colorful beads, [[doubloon]]s (aluminum or wooden dollar-sized coins usually impressed with a krewe logo), decorated plastic ''throw cups'', and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.\n\nWhile many tourists center their Mardi Gras season activities on [[Bourbon Street]] and the [[French Quarter]], none of the major Mardi Gras parades has entered the Quarter since 1972 because of its narrow streets and overhead obstructions. Instead, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along [[St. Charles Avenue]] and [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], on the upriver side of the French Quarter.\n\nTo New Orleanians, \"Mardi Gras\" specifically refers to the Tuesday before Lent, the highlight of the season. The term can also be used less specifically for the whole Carnival season, sometimes as \"the Mardi Gras season\". The terms \"Fat Tuesday\" or \"Mardi Gras Day\" always refer only to that specific day.\n\n== Creole places ==\n\n===Cane River Creoles===\nWhile the sophisticated Creole society of New Orleans has historically received much attention, the [[Cane River]] area developed its own strong Creole culture. The Cane River Creole community in the northern part of the state, along the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and Cane River, is made up of multi-racial descendants of [[French people|French]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], similar mixed Creole migrants from [[New Orleans]] and various other ethnic groups who inhabited this region in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The community is located in and around Isle Brevelle in lower [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]], Louisiana. There are many Creole communities within Natchitoches Parish, including [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Cloutierville, Louisiana|Cloutierville]], [[Derry, Louisiana|Derry]], Gorum and [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]]. Many of their historic plantations still exist.<ref name=\"nsula.edu\">[http://www.nsula.edu/regionalfolklife/crcc/default.htm \"Cane River Creole Community-A Driving Tour\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331221946/http://www.nsula.edu/regionalfolklife/crcc/default.htm |date=2008-03-31 }}, Louisiana Regional Folklife Center, Northwestern State University, accessed 3 Feb 2009</ref> Some have been designated as [[National Historic Landmarks]], and are noted within the Cane River National Heritage Area, as well as the [[Cane River Creole National Historical Park]].

This area is known for the [[False River (Louisiana)|False River]]; the parish seat is [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]], and villages including [[Morganza, Louisiana|Morganza]] are located off the river. This parish is known to be uniquely Creole; today a large portion of the nearly 22,000 residents can trace Creole ancestry. The area was noted for its many plantations and cultural life during the French, Spanish, and American colonial periods.\n\nThe population here had become bilingual or even trilingual with French, Louisiana Creole, and English because of its plantation business before most of Louisiana. The Louisiana Creole language is widely associated with this parish; the local mainland French and Creole (i.e., locally born) plantation owners and their African slaves formed it as communication language, which became the primary language for many Pointe Coupee residents well into the 20th century. The local white and black populations as well as persons of blended ethnicity spoke the language, because of its importance to the region; Italian immigrants in the 19th century often adopted the language.<ref>Costello, Brian J.

Most of his 19 solely-authored [[books]], six co-authored [[books]] and numerous feature articles and participation in documentaries since 1987 have addressed these topics. He was immersed in the area's Louisiana Creole dialect in his childhood, through inter-familial and community immersion and is, therefore, one of the dialect's most fluent, and last, speakers.\n\n=== Avoyelles Creoles ===\n[[Avoyelles Parish]] has a history rich in Creole ancestry. Marksville has a significant populace of French Creoles who have Native American ancestry. The languages that are spoken are Louisiana French and English. This parish was established in 1750. The Creole community in Avoyelles parish is alive and well and has a unique blend of family, food and Creole culture. Creole family names of this region are: Auzenne, Barbin, Beaudoin, Biagas, Bordelon, Boutte, Broussard, Carriere, Chargois, DeBellevue, DeCuir, Deshotels, Dufour, DuCote, Esprit, Fontenot, Fuselier, Gaspard, Gauthier, Goudeau, Gremillion, Guillory, Lamartiniere, Lemelle, Lemoine, LeRoux, Mayeux, Mouton, Moten, Muellon, Normand, Perrie, Rabalais, Ravarre, Saucier, Sylvan and Tyler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avoyelles.com/|title=Avoyelles Family Name Origins|website=www.avoyelles.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> A French Creole Heritage day has been held annually in Avoyelles Parish on Bastille Day since 2012.\n\n=== Evangeline Parish Creoles ===\n{{cleanup|section|reason=Needs proper formatting in line with Manual of Style|date=November 2014}}\n[[Evangeline Parish]] was formed out of the northwestern part of [[St. Landry Parish]] in 1910, and is therefore, a former part of the old Poste des Opelousas territory. Most of this region's population was a direct result of the North American Creole & [[M\u00e9tis]] influx of 1763, the result of the end of the [[French & Indian War]] which saw former French colonial settlements from as far away as \"Upper Louisiana\" (Great Lakes region, Indiana, Illinois) to \"Lower Louisiana's\" (Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama), ceded to British America. \nThe majority of these French Creoles and M\u00e9tis peoples chose to leave their former homes electing to head for the only 'French' exempted settlement area in Lower Louisiana, the \"Territory of Orleans\" or the modern State of Louisiana.\n \nThese Creoles and M\u00e9tis families generally did not remain in New Orleans and opted for settlement in the northwestern \"Creole parishes\" of higher ground. This area reaches upwards to Pointe Coupee, St. Landry, Avoyelles and what became Evangeline Parish in 1910. Along with these diverse M\u00e9tis & Creole families came West Indian slaves ([[Caribbean people]]).\n\nStill later, Saint-Domingue/Haitian Creoles, Napoleonic soldiers, and 19th century French families would also settle this region.\nOne of Napoleon Bonaparte's adjutant majors is actually considered the founder of Ville Platte, the parish seat of Evangeline Parish. General Antoine Paul Joseph Louis Garrigues de Flaugeac and his fellow Napoleonic soldiers, Benoit DeBaillon, Louis Van Hille, and Wartelle's descendants also settled in St. Landry Parish and became important public, civic, and political figures. They were discovered on the levee in tattered uniforms by a wealthy Creole planter, \"Grand Louis' Fontenot of St. Landry (and what is now, Evangeline Parish), a descendant of one of Governor Jean-Batiste LeMoyne, Sieur de Bienville's French officers from Fort Toulouse, in what is now the State of Alabama.<ref>Napoleon's Soldiers In America, by Simone de la Souchere-Delery, 1998</ref>\n\nMany Colonial French, Swiss German, Austrian, and Spanish Creole surnames still remain among prominent and common families alike in Evangeline Parish. Some later Irish and Italian names also appear.

Other parishes so recognized include Avoyelles, St. Landry and Pointe Coupee Parishes. [[Natchitoches Parish]] also remains recognized as \"Creole\".\n\nEvangeline Parish's French-speaking Senator, Eric LaFleur sponsored SR No. 30 which was written by Louisiana French Creole scholar, educator and author, John laFleur II. The parish's namesake of \"Evangeline\" is a reflection of the affection the parish's founder, Paulin Fontenot had for Henry Wadsworth's famous poem of the same name, and not an indication of the parish's ethnic origin. The adoption of \"Cajun\" by the residents of this parish reflects both the popular commerce as well as media conditioning, since this northwestern region of the French-speaking triangle was never part of the [[Acadian]] settlement region of the Spanish period.<ref>Dr. Carl A. Brasseaux's \"The Founding of New Acadia: The Beginnings of Acadian Life in Louisiana,\" 1765-1803</ref>\n\nThe community now hosts an annual \"Creole Families Bastille Day (weekend) Heritage & Honorarium Festival in which a celebration of Louisiana's multi-ethnic French Creoles is held, with Catholic mass, Bastille Day Champagne toasting of honorees who've worked in some way to preserve and promote the French Creole heritage and language traditions. Louisiana authors, Creole food, and cultural events featuring scholarly lectures and historical information along with fun for families with free admission, and vendor booths are also a feature of this very interesting festival which unites all French Creoles who share this common culture and heritage.\n\n=== St. Landry Creoles ===\n[[St. Landry Parish]] has a significant population of Creoles, especially in Opelousas and its surrounding areas. The traditions and Creole heritage are prevalent in Opelousas, Port Barre, Melville, Palmetto, Lawtell, Eunice, Swords, Mallet, Frilot Cove, Plaisance, Pitreville, and many other villages, towns and communities. The Roman Catholic Church and French/Creole language are dominant features of this rich culture. Zydeco musicians host festivals all through the year.

People of any race or ethnicity can and have identified as Creoles, and it is a misconception that ''cr\u00e9olit\u00e9\u2014''the quality of being Creole''\u2014''implies mixed racial origins. In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the class of [[free people of color]] in Louisiana became associated with the term Creole and further identification with mixed race took place during the interwar period in the 20th century. One historian has described this period as the \"Americanization of Creoles,\" including an acceptance of the American binary racial system that divided Creoles into those who identified as mostly white and others as mostly black. (See [[Creoles of color]].)\n\n''Cr\u00e9ole'' was used casually as an identity in the 1700s in Louisiana. Starting in the very early 1800s in Louisiana, after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase, the term \"Creole\" began to take on a more political meaning and identity, especially for those persons of Latinate culture. These generally Catholic French speakers had a culture that contrasted with the [[Protestant]] English-speaking and Anglo culture of the new American settlers from the Upper South and the North.  \n\nIn the early 19th century, amid the [[Haitian Revolution]], thousands of refugees (both whites and free people of color from [[Saint-Domingue]] ([[affranchi]]s or [[gens de couleur libres]]) arrived in New Orleans, often bringing enslaved Africans with them. So many refugees arrived that the city's population doubled. As more refugees were allowed in Louisiana, Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived. These groups had strong influences on the city and its culture. Half of the white \u00e9migr\u0117 population of Haiti settled in Louisiana, especially in the greater New Orleans area. Later 19th-century immigrants to New Orleans, such as [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[German Americans|Germans]] and [[Italian Americans|Italians]], also married into the Creole groups. Most of the new immigrants were also Catholic.\n\nThere was also a sizable German Creole group of full German descent, centering on the parishes of St. Charles and St. John the Baptist. (It is for these settlers that the [[Des Allemands, Louisiana|C\u00f4te des Allemands]], literally \"The German Coast,\" is named.) Over time, many of these groups assimilated, in part or completely, into the dominant French Creole culture, often adopting the French language and customs. \n\nAlthough [[Cajuns]] are often presented in the twenty-first century as a group distinct from the Creoles, many historical accounts exist wherein persons with [[Acadian]] surnames either self-identify or are identified by others as being Creole, and some nineteenth century sources make specific references to \"Acadian Creoles.\" As people born in colonial Louisiana, people of Acadian ancestry could and can be referred to as Creole, and until the early-mid twentieth century Cajuns were considered a subcategory of Louisiana Creole rather than a wholly separate group. Today, however, some Louisianans who identify as Cajun reject association as Creole, while others may embrace both identities. \n\nCreoles of French descent, including those descended from the Acadians, have historically made up the majority of white Creoles in Louisiana. Louisiana Creoles are mostly Catholic in religion. Throughout the 19th century, most Creoles spoke French and were strongly connected to French colonial culture.<ref name=\"more than Cajun\">Christophe Landry, [http://www.francolouisiane.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=56&lang=en \"Primer on Francophone Louisiana: more than Cajun\"], \"francolouisiane.com\", accessed October 19, 2011</ref> The sizeable [[Isle\u00f1os in Louisiana|Spanish Creole communities]] of [[Saint Bernard Parish]] and [[Galveztown, Louisiana|Galveztown]] spoke Spanish. The Malague\u00f1os of New Iberia spoke Spanish as well. The Isle\u00f1os and Malague\u00f1os were Louisiana-born whites of Creole heritage. (Since the mid-20th century, however, the number of Spanish-speaking Creoles has declined in favor of English speakers, and few people under 80 years old speak Spanish.) They have maintained cultural traditions from the [[Canary Islands]], where their immigrant ancestors came from.<ref name=\"Tradici\u00f3n Hispano - Canaria\">[[Samuel G. Armistead|G.

Ed: First Edition, March 2007.</ref> However, just as with the Spanish Creoles, native languages of all Creole groups, whether French, Spanish or German, have declined over the years in favor of the English spoken by the majority of the population. The different varieties of Louisiana's Creoles shaped the state's culture, particularly in the southern areas around New Orleans and the plantation districts. Louisiana is known as the Creole State.<ref name=\"more than Cajun\" />\n\nWhile the sophisticated Creole society of New Orleans, which centered mainly on white Creoles, such as the French Creole, has historically received much attention, the [[Cane River]] area in northwest Louisiana, populated chiefly by [[Creoles of color]], also developed its own strong Creole culture. Other enclaves of Creole culture have been located in south and southwest Louisiana: [[Frilot Cove]], [[Bois Mallet]], [[Grand Marais, Louisiana|Grand Marais]], Palmetto, Lawtell, Soileau and others. These communities have had a long history of cultural independence. \n\nNew Orleans also has had a significant historical population of Creoles of color as well, a group that was mostly [[free people of color]], of mixed European, African, and Native American descent. Another area where many creoles can be found is within the River Parishes: St. Charles, St. John, and St. James. Many white Creoles of German and French descent have also settled there. Most white Creoles are found in the greater New Orleans region, a seven parish-wide Creole cultural area including Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Charles, St. Tammany and St. John the Baptist parishes. Also, Avoyelles and Evangeline parishes in [[Acadiana]] also have large white creole populations of French descent, also known as French Creoles.\n\n==History==\n\n===1st French period===\n{{Main|Louisiana (New France)}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|right|340px|Map of [[North America]] in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (part of the international [[Seven Years' War]] (1756 to 1763)). Possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange).]]\n\nThrough both the French and Spanish (late 18th century) regimes, parochial and colonial governments used the term Creole for ethnic French and Spanish born in the New World as opposed to Europe. Parisian French was the predominant language among colonists in early New Orleans.\n\nLater the regional French evolved to contain local phrases and slang terms. The French Creoles spoke what became known as [[Colonial French]]. Because of isolation, the language in the colony developed differently from that in France. It was spoken by the ethnic French and Spanish and their Creole descendants.\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of Louisiana Creole today is a person descended from ancestors in Louisiana before the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States in 1803.<ref name=\"Managan\"/>  An estimated 7,000 European immigrants settled in Louisiana during the 18th century, one percent of the number of British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies along the Atlantic coast. Louisiana attracted considerably fewer French colonists than did its West Indian colonies. After the crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which lasted more than two months, the colonists had numerous challenges ahead of them in the Louisiana frontier. Their living conditions were difficult: uprooted, they had to face a new, often hostile, environment, with difficult climate and tropical diseases. Many of these immigrants died during the maritime crossing or soon after their arrival.\n\n[[Hurricane]]s, unknown in France, periodically struck the coast, destroying whole villages. The [[Mississippi Delta]] was plagued with periodic [[yellow fever]] epidemics. Europeans also brought the Eurasian diseases of [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], which flourished along with mosquitoes and poor sanitation. These conditions slowed colonization. Moreover, French villages and forts were not always sufficient to protect from enemy offensives. Attacks by Native Americans represented a real threat to the groups of isolated colonists. The [[Natchez people|Natchez]] killed 250 colonists in Lower Louisiana in retaliation for encroachment by the Europeans. The Natchez warriors took [[Fort Rosalie]] (now [[Natchez, Mississippi]]) by surprise, killing many individuals. During the next two years, the French attacked the Natchez in return, causing them to flee or, when captured, be [[deportation|deported]] as slaves to their Caribbean colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (later [[Haiti]]).\n\n====Casket girls====\nAside from French government representatives and soldiers, colonists included mostly young men who were recruited in French ports or in Paris. Some served as [[indentured servant]]s; they were required to remain in Louisiana for a length of time, fixed by the contract of service, to pay back the cost of passage and board. During this time, they were \"temporary semi-slaves\". To increase the colonial population, the government recruited young Frenchwomen, known as ''[[Casquette girl|filles \u00e0 la cassette]]'' (in English, ''casket girls'', referring to the casket or case of belongings they brought with them) to go to the colony to be wed to colonial soldiers. The king financed dowries for each girl. (This practice was similar to events in  17th-century Quebec: about 800 ''[[filles du roi]]'' (daughters of the king) were recruited to immigrate to [[New France]] under the monetary sponsorship of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].)\n\nIn addition, French authorities deported some female criminals to the colony.  For example, in 1721, the ship ''La Baleine'' brought close to 90 women of childbearing age from the prison of [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital|La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]] in Paris to Louisiana. Most of the women quickly found husbands among the male residents of the colony. These women, many of whom were most likely [[prostitutes]] or felons, were known as ''The Baleine Brides''.<ref>''National Genealogical Society Quarterly,'' December 1987; vol.75, number 4: \"The Baleine Brides: A Missing Ship's Roll for Louisiana\"</ref> Such events inspired ''[[Manon Lescaut]]'' (1731), a novel written by the [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]], which was later adapted as an opera in the 19th century.\n\nHistorian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that casket girls (considered among the ancestors of French Creoles) were transported to Louisiana. (The Ursuline order of nuns, who were said to chaperone the girls until they married, have denied the casket girl myth as well.) Martin suggests this account was mythical. The system of [[pla\u00e7age]] that continued into the 19th century resulted in many young white men having women of color as partners and mothers of their children, often before or even after their marriages to white women.<ref>Joan M. Martin, ''Pla\u00e7age and the Louisiana Gens de Couleur Libre,'' in [[Louisiana Creole|Creole]], edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.</ref> French Louisiana also included communities of Swiss and German settlers; however, royal authorities did not refer to \"Louisianans\" but described the colonial population as \"French\" citizens.\n\n===Spanish period===\n{{Main|Louisiana (New Spain)}}\nThe [[Louisiana (New France)|French colony]] was ceded to Spain in the secret [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)]], in the final stages of the [[Seven Years' War]], which took place on two continents. The Spanish were slow and reluctant to fully occupy the colony, however, and did not do so until 1769. That year Spain abolished Indian slavery. In addition, Spanish liberal [[manumission]] policies contributed to the growth of the population of Creoles of Color, particularly in New Orleans. Nearly all of the surviving 18th-century [[architecture]] of the Vieux Carr\u00e9 ([[French Quarter]]) dates from the Spanish period (the Ursuline Convent an exception). These buildings were designed by French architects, as there were no Spanish architects in Louisiana. The buildings of the French Quarter are of a Mediterranean style also found in southern France.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title=National Park Service. Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings.

By the end of the 18th century, many mixed-race Creoles had gained education and tended to work in artisan or skilled trades; a relatively high number were property and slave owners. The Louisiana Creole language developed primarily from the influence of French and African languages, enabling slaves from different tribes and colonists to communicate.\n\n===2nd French period and Louisiana Purchase===\n[[File:Painting of Creole Woman and Boy by Anna Maria Von Phul.jpg|thumb|Painting of Creole Woman and Boy by [[Anna Maria von Phul]], 1818]]\nSpain ceded Louisiana back to France in 1800 through the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the [[United States]] in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, following defeat of his forces in Saint-Domingue. He had been trying to regain control of the island colony following a multi-year slave rebellion.\n\nThousands of refugees from the revolution, both [[White people|whites]] and ''affranchis'' or ''Gens de Couleur Libres'', arrived in New Orleans, often bringing their [[Africa]]n [[slaves]] with them. These groups had a strong influence on the city, increasing the number of French speakers, Africans with strong traditional customs, and Creoles of Color. The [[Haitian Revolution]] ended in the slaves gaining independence in 1804, establishing the second [[republic]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and the first republic led by [[black people]]. While Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne|Claiborne]] and other officials wanted to keep out additional [[free black]] men, the French Creoles wanted to increase the [[French language|French]]-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed in Louisiana, Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived.<ref name=\"AAM\"/> Many of the white [[Francophones]] had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for [[Bonapartist]] schemes in [[Spain]].<ref>''The Bourgeois Frontier : French Towns, French Traders and American Expansion,'' by Jay Gitlin (2009). Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10118-8}}, pg 54</ref> After the Purchase, many Americans were also migrating to Louisiana. Later European immigrants included Irish, Germans, and Italians.\n\nDuring the antebellum years, the major [[commodity crops]] were [[sugar cane|sugar]] and [[cotton]], cultivated on large plantations along the Mississippi River outside the city with [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. Plantations were developed in the French style, with narrow waterfronts for access on the river, and long plots running back inland.\n\nNearly 90 percent of early 19th century immigrants to the territory settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration from Cuba brought 2,731 whites; 3,102 ''Gens de Couleur Libres''; and 3,226 enslaved persons of African descent, which in total doubled the city's population. The city became 63 percent black in population, a greater proportion than [[Charleston, South Carolina]]'s 53 percent.<ref name=\"AAM\">[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=5&topic=3 \"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries\"], ''In Motion: African American Migration Experience,'' New York Public Library, accessed 7 May 2008</ref>\n\nThe transfer of the French colony to the United States and the arrival of Anglo-Americans from New England and the South resulted in a cultural confrontation. Some Americans were reportedly shocked by aspects of the culture and French-speaking society of the newly acquired territory: the predominance of the French language and Roman Catholicism, the free class of mixed-race people, and the strong African traditions of enslaved peoples. They pressured the United States' first governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]], [[William C. C. Claiborne|W.C.C. Claiborne]], to change it.\n\nParticularly in the slave society of the [[Southern United States|South]], slavery had become a racial caste. Since the late 17th century, children in the colonies took the status of their mothers at birth; therefore, all children of enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of the race or status of their fathers. This produced many mixed-race slaves over the generations. Whites classified society into whites and blacks (the latter associated strongly with slaves). Although there was a growing population of [[free people of color]], particularly in the Upper South, they generally did not have the same rights and freedoms as [[Creoles of Color]] in Louisiana under French and Spanish rule, who held office in some cases and served in the militia. For example, around 80 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that fought in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Battle of Baton Rouge]] in 1779.<ref>Charles Gayarr\u00e9, ''History of Louisiana: The Spanish domination'', William J. Widdleton, 1867, pp 126-132</ref> And 353 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that fought in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1812.<ref>[http://www.wcny.org/education/war-of-1812/the-battle-of-new-orleans-treaty-of-ghent/ \"The Battle of New Orleans\"], wcny.org, Accessed September 1, 2016</ref> Later on, some of the descendants of these Creole of Color veterans of the Battle of New Orleans, like [[Caesar Antoine]], went on to fight in the [[American Civil War]].\n\nWhen Claiborne made English the official language of the territory, the French Creoles of New Orleans were outraged, and reportedly paraded in protest in the streets. They rejected the Americans' effort to transform them overnight. In addition, upper-class French Creoles thought that many of the arriving Americans were uncouth, especially the rough Kentucky boatmen (Kaintucks) who regularly visited the city, having maneuvered flatboats down the Mississippi River filled with goods for market.\n\nRealizing that he needed local support, Claiborne restored French as an official language. In all forms of government, public forums, and in the [[Catholic Church]], French continued to be used. Most importantly, [[Louisiana French]] and Louisiana Creole remained the languages of the majority of the population of the state, leaving English and Spanish as minority languages.\n\n==Ethnic blend and race==\n{{further|Creoles of color}}\n\n[[File:Adah Isaacs Menken, age 19, 1854-55.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Adah Isaacs Menken]], Creole actress, painter and poet]]\nColonists referred to themselves and enslaved Black people who were native-born as creole, to distinguish them from new arrivals from France and Spain as well as Africa.<ref name=\"Managan\"/> [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], such as the [[Creek people]], intermixed with Creoles also, making three races present in the ethnic group.\n\nLike \"Cajun,\" the term \"Creole\" is a popular name used to describe cultures in the southern Louisiana area. \"Creole\" can be roughly defined as \"native to a region,\" but its precise meaning varies according to the geographic area in which it is used. Generally, however, Creoles felt the need to distinguish themselves from the influx of American and European immigrants coming into the area after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. \"Creole\" is still used to describe the heritage and customs of the various people who settled Louisiana during the early French colonial times. In addition to the French Canadians, the amalgamated Creole culture in southern Louisiana includes influences from the [[Chitimacha]], [[Houma people|Houma]] and other native tribes, enslaved West Africans, Spanish-speaking [[Isle\u00f1os]] (Canary Islanders) and French-speaking ''[[Gens de couleur|Gens de Couleur Libres]]'' from the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/cultural_diversity/Jean_Lafitte_Historical_Park.html|title=Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve: Places Reflecting America's Diverse Cultures Explore their Stories in the National Park System: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=3 February 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nAs a group, mixed-race Creoles rapidly began to acquire education, skills (many in New Orleans worked as craftsmen and artisans), businesses and property. They were overwhelmingly Catholic, spoke [[Louisiana Colonial French|Colonial French]] (although some also spoke [[Louisiana Creole]]), and kept up many French social customs, modified by other parts of their ancestry and Louisiana culture. The Creoles of Color often [[endogamy|married among themselves]] to maintain their class and social culture. The French-speaking mixed-race population came to be called \"Creoles of color\". It was said that \"New Orleans persons of color were far wealthier, more secure and more established than freed unmixed Black Creoles and Cajuns elsewhere in Louisiana.\"<ref name=\"everyculture.com\"/>\n\nUnder the French and Spanish rulers, Louisiana developed a three-tiered society, similar to that of [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], [[Brazil]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and other Latin colonies. This [[casta|three-tiered society]] included white Creoles; a prosperous, educated group of mixed-race Creoles of European, African and Native American descent; and the far larger class of African and Black Creole slaves. The status of mixed-race Creoles of color (''Gens de Couleur Libres'') was one they guarded carefully. By law they enjoyed most of the same rights and privileges as white Creoles. They could and often did challenge the law in court and won cases against white Creoles. They were property owners and created schools for their children. In many cases though, these different tiers viewed themselves as one group, as other [[Ibero-America|Iberoamerican]] and [[Francophonie|Francophone]] ethnic groups commonly did. Race did not play as central a role as it does in Anglo-American culture: oftentimes, race was not a concern, but instead, family standing and wealth were key distinguishing factors in New Orleans and beyond.<ref name=\"Managan\"/> The Creole civil rights activist [[Rodolphe Desdunes]] explained the difference between Creoles and Anglo-Americans, concerning the widespread belief in [[racialism]] by the latter, as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The groups (Latin and Anglo New Orleaneans) had \"two different schools of politics [and differed] radically ... in aspiration and method. One hopes [Latins], and the other doubts [Anglos]. Thus we often perceive that one makes every effort to acquire merits, the other to gain advantages. One aspires to equality, the other to identity. One will forget that he is a Negro in order to think that he is a man; the other will forget that he is a man to think that he is a Negro.<ref>Christophe Landry, [https://cerebellum1.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/wearing-the-wrong-spectacles-and-catching-the-time-disease/ \"Wearing the wrong spectacles and catching the Time disease!\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014005153/https://cerebellum1.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/wearing-the-wrong-spectacles-and-catching-the-time-disease/ |date=2016-10-14 }}, Accessed August 23, 2016</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the United States acquired the area in the Louisiana Purchase, mixed-race Creoles of Color resisted American attempts to impose their binary racial culture. In the American South slavery had become virtually a racial caste, in which most people of any African descent were considered to be lower in status. The planter society viewed it as a binary culture, with whites and blacks (the latter including everyone other than whites, although for some years they counted mulattos separately on censuses).<ref name=\"Managan\"/>\n\nWhile the American Civil War promised rights and opportunities for the enslaved, the [[Creoles of Color]], who had long been free before the war, worried about losing their identity and position. The Americans did not legally recognize a three-tiered society; nevertheless, some Creoles of Color such as [[Thomy Lafon]], [[Victor S\u00e9jour]] and others, used their position to support the abolitionist cause.<ref>[http://www.theneworleanstribune.com/main/keep-up-the-fight/ \"Keep Up The Fight\"], theneworleanstribune.com, Accessed September 1, 2016</ref> And the Creole of Color, Francis E.

It makes use of what is sometimes called the [[Holy trinity (cuisine)|Holy trinity]]: onions, celery and green peppers. It has developed primarily from various European, African, and Native American historic culinary influences. A distinctly different style of Creole or Cajun cooking exists in [[Acadiana]].\n\n[[Gumbo]] (''Gomb\u00f4'' in Louisiana Creole, ''Gombo'' in Louisiana French) is a traditional Creole dish from New Orleans with French, Spanish, Native American, African, German, Italian, and Caribbean influences. It is a roux-based meat stew or soup, sometimes made with some combination of any of the following: seafood (usually shrimp, crabs, with oysters optional, or occasionally crawfish), sausage, chicken (hen or rooster), alligator, turtle, rabbit, duck, deer or wild boar. Gumbo is often seasoned with [[Fil\u00e9 powder|fil\u00e9]], which is dried and ground [[sassafras]] leaves. Both meat and seafood versions also include the \"Holy Trinity\" and are served like stew over rice. It developed from French colonists trying to make ''[[bouillabaisse]]'' with New World ingredients. Starting with aromatic seasonings, the French used onions and celery as in a traditional ''[[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]]'', but lacked [[carrot]]s, so they substituted green bell peppers. Africans contributed [[okra]], traditionally grown in regions of Africa, the [[Middle East]] and Spain. ''Gombo'' is the Louisiana French word for okra, which is derived from a shortened version of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] words ''kilogomb\u00f3'' or ''kigamb\u00f3,'' also ''guingamb\u00f3'' or ''quinbomb\u00f3''. \"Gumbo\" became the anglicized version of the word 'Gombo' after the [[English language]] became dominant in Louisiana. In Louisiana French dialects, the word \"gombo\" still refers to both the hybrid stew and the vegetable. The Choctaw contributed ''fil\u00e9''; the Spanish contributed peppers and tomatoes; and new spices were adopted from Caribbean dishes. The French later favored a ''[[roux]]'' for thickening. In the 19th century, the Italians added [[garlic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} After arriving in numbers, German immigrants dominated New Orleans city bakeries, including those making traditional French bread. They introduced having buttered French bread as a side to eating gumbo, as well as a side of German-style potato salad.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Jambalaya]] is the second of the famous Louisiana Creole dishes. It developed in the European communities of New Orleans. It combined ham with sausage, rice and tomato as a variation of the Spanish dish ''[[paella]],'' and was based on locally available ingredients. The name for jambalaya comes from the [[Occitan]] language spoken in southern France, where it means \"mash-up.\" The term also refers to a type of rice cooked with chicken.\n\nToday, jambalaya is commonly made with [[seafood]] (usually [[shrimp]]) or [[chicken]], or a combination of [[shrimp]] and [[chicken]]. Most versions contain [[smoked sausage]], more commonly used instead of [[ham]] in modern versions. However, a version of jambalaya that uses [[ham]] with [[shrimp]] may be closer to the original Creole dish.<ref>Jambalaya.\" Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, John F. Mariani, Bloomsbury, 2nd edition, 2014. Credo Reference, https://login.avoserv2.library.fordham.edu/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/bloomfood/jambalaya/0?institutionId=3205. Accessed 23 Oct. 2019.\n</ref>\n\nJambalaya is prepared in two ways: \"red\" and \"brown\". Red is the [[tomato]]-based version native to New Orleans; it is also found in parts of Iberia and St. Martin parishes, and generally uses shrimp or chicken stock. The red-style Creole jambalaya is the original version. The \"brown\" version is associated with Cajun cooking and does not include tomatoes.\n\nRed beans and rice is a dish of Louisiana and Caribbean influence, originating in New Orleans. It contains red beans, the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery, and bell pepper, and often ''[[andouille]]'' smoked sausage, pickled pork, or smoked ham hocks. The beans are served over white rice. It is one of the famous dishes in Louisiana, and is associated with \"washday Monday\". It could be cooked all day over a low flame while the women of the house attended to washing the family's clothes.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Creole music}}\n[[File:CreoleGirlsPlaquemines1935.jpg|right|thumb|Creole women, [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana]]\" (1935 photo by [[Ben Shahn]])]]\n''[[Zydeco]]'' (a transliteration in English of 'zaric\u00f4' (snapbeans) from the song, \"Les haricots sont pas sal\u00e9s\"), was born in black Creole communities on the prairies of southwest Louisiana in the 1920s. It is often considered the Creole music of Louisiana. Zydeco, a derivative of Cajun music, purportedly hails from ''L\u00e0-l\u00e0,'' a genre of music now defunct, and old south Louisiana ''jur\u00e9s.''  As [[Louisiana French]] and Louisiana Creole was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the prairies of southwest Louisiana, zydeco was initially sung only in Louisiana French or Creole. Later, Louisiana Creoles, such as the 20th-century Ch\u00e9nier brothers, Andrus Espree (Beau Jocque), [[Rosie Ledet|Rosie L\u00e9det]] and others began incorporating a more bluesy sound and added a new linguistic element to zydeco music: English.  Today, zydeco musicians sing in English, Louisiana Creole or Colonial Louisiana French.\n\nToday's Zydeco often incorporates a blend of [[swamp pop]], [[blues]], and/or [[jazz]] as well as \"Cajun Music\" (originally called Old Louisiana French Music).  An instrument unique to zydeco is a form of washboard called the ''[[vest frottoir|frottoir]]'' or scrub board. This is a vest made of corrugated aluminum, and played by the musician working bottle openers, bottle caps or spoons up and down the length of the vest.  Another instrument used in both Zydeco and Cajun music since the 1800s is the accordion. Zydeco music makes use of the piano or button accordion while Cajun music is played on the diatonic accordion, or Cajun accordion, often called a \"squeeze box\".  Cajun musicians also use the fiddle and steel guitar more often than do those playing Zydeco.\n\nZydeco can be traced to the music of enslaved African people from the 19th century. It is represented in ''[[Slave Songs of the United States]],'' first published in 1867. The final seven songs in that work are printed with melody along with text in Louisiana Creole. These and many other songs were sung by slaves on plantations, especially in [[St. Charles Parish]], and when they gathered on Sundays at [[Congo Square]] in New Orleans.\n\nAmong the Spanish Creole people highlights, between their varied traditional folklore, the Canarian [[D\u00e9cimas]], [[Romance (music)|romances]], [[ballads]] and pan-Hispanic songs date back many years, even to the [[Medieval Age]]. This folklore was carried by their ancestors from the Canary Islands to Louisiana in the 18th century. It also highlights their adaptation to the [[Isle\u00f1os in Louisiana|Isle\u00f1o]] music to other music outside of the community (especially from the Mexican [[Corridos]]).<ref name=\"Tradici\u00f3n Hispano - Canaria\"/>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Louisiana French|Louisiana Creole}}\n[[File:Louisiana French 19th century document 2.png|thumb|right|19th-century newspaper clipping from Thibodaux, LA]]\n\nLouisiana Creole (''Kr\u00e9yol La Lwizy\u00e0n'') is a [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] <ref>\"Louisiana Creole Dictionary\", www.LouisianaCreoleDictionary.com Website, accessed 15 July 2014</ref> language spoken by the Louisiana Creole people and sometimes Cajuns and Anglo-residents of the state of [[Louisiana]].

The language and music is widely spoken there;  the 5th ward of Houston was originally called Frenchtown due to that reason.  There were also Zydeco clubs started in Houston, like the famed Silver Slipper owned by a Creole named Alfred Cormier that has hosted the likes of Clifton Chenier and Boozoo Chavais.\n\nOn the other hand, Spanish usage has fallen markedly over the years among the Spanish Creoles. Still, in the first half of twentieth century, most of the people of Saint Bernard and [[Galveztown, Louisiana|Galveztown]] spoke the Spanish language with the [[Canarian Spanish]] dialect (the ancestors of these Creoles were from the [[Canary Islands]]) of the 18th century, but the government of Louisiana imposed the use of English in these communities, especially in the schools (e.g. Saint Bernard) where if a teacher heard children speaking Spanish she would fine them and punish them. Now, only some people over the age of 80 can speak Spanish in these communities. Most of the youth of Saint Bernard can only speak English.<ref name=\"Tradici\u00f3n Hispano - Canaria\"/>\n\n===New Orleans Mardi Gras===\n{{Main|New Orleans Mardi Gras}}\n[[File:MardiGrasCanalStreet1890sChartresGazebo.jpg|thumb|left|[[New Orleans Mardi Gras]] in the early 1890s]]\nMardi Gras (Fat Tuesday in [[English language|English]]) in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], is a [[Carnival]] celebration well known throughout the world. It has colonial French roots.\n\nThe New Orleans Carnival season, with roots in preparing for the start of the [[Christianity|Christian]] season of [[Lent]], starts after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (January 6). It is a season of [[parade]]s, [[ball (dance)|balls]] (some of them [[masquerade ball]]s) and [[king cake]] parties. It has traditionally been part of the winter social season; at one time \"coming out\" parties for young women at d\u00e9butante balls were timed for this season.\n\nCelebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through [[Fat Tuesday]] (''Mardi Gras'' in French), the day before [[Ash Wednesday]]. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the season. In the final week of Carnival, many events large and small occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities.\n\nThe parades in New Orleans are organized by Carnival ''[[krewe]]s''. Krewe [[float (parade)|float]] riders toss ''throws'' to the crowds; the most common throws are strings of plastic colorful beads, [[doubloon]]s (aluminum or wooden dollar-sized coins usually impressed with a krewe logo), decorated plastic ''throw cups'', and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.\n\nWhile many tourists center their Mardi Gras season activities on [[Bourbon Street]] and the [[French Quarter]], none of the major Mardi Gras parades has entered the Quarter since 1972 because of its narrow streets and overhead obstructions. Instead, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along [[St. Charles Avenue]] and [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], on the upriver side of the French Quarter.\n\nTo New Orleanians, \"Mardi Gras\" specifically refers to the Tuesday before Lent, the highlight of the season. The term can also be used less specifically for the whole Carnival season, sometimes as \"the Mardi Gras season\". The terms \"Fat Tuesday\" or \"Mardi Gras Day\" always refer only to that specific day.\n\n== Creole places ==\n\n===Cane River Creoles===\nWhile the sophisticated Creole society of New Orleans has historically received much attention, the [[Cane River]] area developed its own strong Creole culture. The Cane River Creole community in the northern part of the state, along the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and Cane River, is made up of multi-racial descendants of [[French people|French]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], similar mixed Creole migrants from [[New Orleans]] and various other ethnic groups who inhabited this region in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The community is located in and around Isle Brevelle in lower [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]], Louisiana. There are many Creole communities within Natchitoches Parish, including [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Cloutierville, Louisiana|Cloutierville]], [[Derry, Louisiana|Derry]], Gorum and [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]]. Many of their historic plantations still exist.<ref name=\"nsula.edu\">[http://www.nsula.edu/regionalfolklife/crcc/default.htm \"Cane River Creole Community-A Driving Tour\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331221946/http://www.nsula.edu/regionalfolklife/crcc/default.htm |date=2008-03-31 }}, Louisiana Regional Folklife Center, Northwestern State University, accessed 3 Feb 2009</ref> Some have been designated as [[National Historic Landmarks]], and are noted within the Cane River National Heritage Area, as well as the [[Cane River Creole National Historical Park]]. Some plantations are sites on the [[Louisiana African American Heritage Trail]].\n\nIsle Brevelle, the area of land between Cane River and Bayou Brevelle, encompasses approximately {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} of land, 16,000 acres of which are still owned by descendants of the original Creole families. The Cane River as well as Avoyelles and St. Landry Creole family surnames include but are not limited to: Antee, Anty, Arceneaux, Arnaud, Balthazar, Barre', Bayonne, Beaudoin, Bellow, Bernard, Biagas, Bossier, Boy\u00e9r, Brossette, Buard, Byone, Carriere, Cassine, Catalon, Chevalier, Christophe, Cloutier, Colson, Colston, Conde, Conant, Cout\u00e9e, Cyriak, Cyriaque, Damas, DeB\u00f2is, DeCuir, Deculus, Delphin, De Sadier, De Soto, Dubreil, Dunn, Dupr\u00e9.

(Most of the surnames are of French and sometimes Spanish origin).<ref name=\"nsula.edu\"/>\n\n===Pointe Coupee Creoles===\nAnother historic area to Louisiana is [[Pointe Coupee]], an area northwest of Baton Rouge. This area is known for the [[False River (Louisiana)|False River]]; the parish seat is [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]], and villages including [[Morganza, Louisiana|Morganza]] are located off the river. This parish is known to be uniquely Creole; today a large portion of the nearly 22,000 residents can trace Creole ancestry. The area was noted for its many plantations and cultural life during the French, Spanish, and American colonial periods.\n\nThe population here had become bilingual or even trilingual with French, Louisiana Creole, and English because of its plantation business before most of Louisiana. The Louisiana Creole language is widely associated with this parish; the local mainland French and Creole (i.e., locally born) plantation owners and their African slaves formed it as communication language, which became the primary language for many Pointe Coupee residents well into the 20th century. The local white and black populations as well as persons of blended ethnicity spoke the language, because of its importance to the region; Italian immigrants in the 19th century often adopted the language.<ref>Costello, Brian J. ''C'est Ca Ye' Dit''. New Roads Printing, 2004</ref>\n\nCommon Creole family names of the region include the following: Aguillard, Amant, Bergeron, Bonaventure, Boudreaux, Carmouche, Chenevert, Christophe, Decuir, Domingue, Duperon, Eloi, Elloie, Ellois, Fabre, Francois, Gaines, Gremillion, Guerin, Honor\u00e9, Jarreau, Joseph, Morel, Olinde, Porche, Pourciau, St. Patin, Ricard, St. Romain, Tounoir, Val\u00e9ry and dozens more.<ref>Costello, Brian J. ''A History of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana''. Margaret Media, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Brian J. Costello]], an 11th generation Pointe Coupee Parish Creole, is the premiere historian, author and archivist on Pointe Coupee's Creole population, language, social and material culture. Most of his 19 solely-authored [[books]], six co-authored [[books]] and numerous feature articles and participation in documentaries since 1987 have addressed these topics. He was immersed in the area's Louisiana Creole dialect in his childhood, through inter-familial and community immersion and is, therefore, one of the dialect's most fluent, and last, speakers.\n\n=== Avoyelles Creoles ===\n[[Avoyelles Parish]] has a history rich in Creole ancestry. Marksville has a significant populace of French Creoles who have Native American ancestry. The languages that are spoken are Louisiana French and English. This parish was established in 1750. The Creole community in Avoyelles parish is alive and well and has a unique blend of family, food and Creole culture. Creole family names of this region are: Auzenne, Barbin, Beaudoin, Biagas, Bordelon, Boutte, Broussard, Carriere, Chargois, DeBellevue, DeCuir, Deshotels, Dufour, DuCote, Esprit, Fontenot, Fuselier, Gaspard, Gauthier, Goudeau, Gremillion, Guillory, Lamartiniere, Lemelle, Lemoine, LeRoux, Mayeux, Mouton, Moten, Muellon, Normand, Perrie, Rabalais, Ravarre, Saucier, Sylvan and Tyler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avoyelles.com/|title=Avoyelles Family Name Origins|website=www.avoyelles.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> A French Creole Heritage day has been held annually in Avoyelles Parish on Bastille Day since 2012.\n\n=== Evangeline Parish Creoles ===\n{{cleanup|section|reason=Needs proper formatting in line with Manual of Style|date=November 2014}}\n[[Evangeline Parish]] was formed out of the northwestern part of [[St. Landry Parish]] in 1910, and is therefore, a former part of the old Poste des Opelousas territory. Most of this region's population was a direct result of the North American Creole & [[M\u00e9tis]] influx of 1763, the result of the end of the [[French & Indian War]] which saw former French colonial settlements from as far away as \"Upper Louisiana\" (Great Lakes region, Indiana, Illinois) to \"Lower Louisiana's\" (Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama), ceded to British America. \nThe majority of these French Creoles and M\u00e9tis peoples chose to leave their former homes electing to head for the only 'French' exempted settlement area in Lower Louisiana, the \"Territory of Orleans\" or the modern State of Louisiana.\n \nThese Creoles and M\u00e9tis families generally did not remain in New Orleans and opted for settlement in the northwestern \"Creole parishes\" of higher ground. This area reaches upwards to Pointe Coupee, St. Landry, Avoyelles and what became Evangeline Parish in 1910. Along with these diverse M\u00e9tis & Creole families came West Indian slaves ([[Caribbean people]]).\n\nStill later, Saint-Domingue/Haitian Creoles, Napoleonic soldiers, and 19th century French families would also settle this region.\nOne of Napoleon Bonaparte's adjutant majors is actually considered the founder of Ville Platte, the parish seat of Evangeline Parish. General Antoine Paul Joseph Louis Garrigues de Flaugeac and his fellow Napoleonic soldiers, Benoit DeBaillon, Louis Van Hille, and Wartelle's descendants also settled in St. Landry Parish and became important public, civic, and political figures. They were discovered on the levee in tattered uniforms by a wealthy Creole planter, \"Grand Louis' Fontenot of St. Landry (and what is now, Evangeline Parish), a descendant of one of Governor Jean-Batiste LeMoyne, Sieur de Bienville's French officers from Fort Toulouse, in what is now the State of Alabama.<ref>Napoleon's Soldiers In America, by Simone de la Souchere-Delery, 1998</ref>\n\nMany Colonial French, Swiss German, Austrian, and Spanish Creole surnames still remain among prominent and common families alike in Evangeline Parish. Some later Irish and Italian names also appear. Surnames such as, Ardoin, Aguillard, Mouton, Bordelon, Brignac, Brunet, Buller (Buhler), Catoire, Chapman, Coreil, Darbonne, DeBaillion, DeVille, DeVilliers, Duos, Dupre' Estillette, Fontenot, Guillory, Gradney, LaFleur, Landreneau, LaTour, LeBas, LeBleu, LeRoux, Milano-Hebert, Miller, Morein, Moreau, Moten, Mounier, Ortego, Perrodin, Pierotti, Pitre (rare Acadian-Creole), Rozas, Saucier, Schexnayder, Sebastien, Sittig, Soileau, Vidrine, Vizinat and many more are reminiscent of the late French Colonial, early Spanish and later American period of this region's history.<ref>''Louisiana's French Creole Culinary & Linguistic Traditions: Facts vs. Fiction Before And Since Cajunization'' 2013, by J. LaFleur, Brian Costello w/ Dr. Ina Fandrich</ref>\n\nAs of 2013, the parish was once again recognized by the March 2013 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature as part of the Creole Parishes, with the passage of SR No. 30. Other parishes so recognized include Avoyelles, St. Landry and Pointe Coupee Parishes. [[Natchitoches Parish]] also remains recognized as \"Creole\".\n\nEvangeline Parish's French-speaking Senator, Eric LaFleur sponsored SR No. 30 which was written by Louisiana French Creole scholar, educator and author, John laFleur II. The parish's namesake of \"Evangeline\" is a reflection of the affection the parish's founder, Paulin Fontenot had for Henry Wadsworth's famous poem of the same name, and not an indication of the parish's ethnic origin. The adoption of \"Cajun\" by the residents of this parish reflects both the popular commerce as well as media conditioning, since this northwestern region of the French-speaking triangle was never part of the [[Acadian]] settlement region of the Spanish period.<ref>Dr. Carl A. Brasseaux's \"The Founding of New Acadia: The Beginnings of Acadian Life in Louisiana,\" 1765-1803</ref>\n\nThe community now hosts an annual \"Creole Families Bastille Day (weekend) Heritage & Honorarium Festival in which a celebration of Louisiana's multi-ethnic French Creoles is held, with Catholic mass, Bastille Day Champagne toasting of honorees who've worked in some way to preserve and promote the French Creole heritage and language traditions. Louisiana authors, Creole food, and cultural events featuring scholarly lectures and historical information along with fun for families with free admission, and vendor booths are also a feature of this very interesting festival which unites all French Creoles who share this common culture and heritage.\n\n=== St. Landry Creoles ===\n[[St. Landry Parish]] has a significant population of Creoles, especially in Opelousas and its surrounding areas. The traditions and Creole heritage are prevalent in Opelousas, Port Barre, Melville, Palmetto, Lawtell, Eunice, Swords, Mallet, Frilot Cove, Plaisance, Pitreville, and many other villages, towns and communities. The Roman Catholic Church and French/Creole language are dominant features of this rich culture. Zydeco musicians host festivals all through the year. Some Creole family names are: Antoine, Arceneaux, Ardoin, Aubespin, Auzenne, Barnabe, Birotte, Bossier, Breaux, Bushnell, Carrier(e), Caesar (Ceaser), Cezar, Chachere, Chargois, Charlot, Chavis, Chenier, Chevalier, Chretien, Coutee, Craven, Cravins, Darbonne, Darjean, Declouette, Deculus, Delafosse,Donato, Dupre, Durousseau, Esprit, Fontenot, Frank, Frilot, Frug\u00e9, Fuselier, Gallow, Gobert, Gradney, Gradnigo, Guilbeaux, Guillory, Hollier, Jardoin, Jolivette, Jolivet, LaChapelle, LaFleur, LaStrapes, Lavergne, Lavigne, Lazard, Leblanc, LeBon, Lecompte, Ledet, Lemelle, Lemon(d), LeRoux, Vidrine, Moten, Moton, Mouton, Pain, Papillion, Poullard, Piert, Rene, Rideau, Richard, Rosignon (Rousillion), Rougeau, Simien, Soileau, Sonnier, St. Mary, Thierry, Valmont, Vallair and Villere.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main list|List of Louisiana Creoles}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n\n* [[Creoles of color]]\n* [[Cane River Creole National Historical Park]]\n* [[Melrose Plantation]]\n* [[French Quarter]]\n* [[Faubourg Marigny]]\n* [[Trem\u00e9]]\n* [[Little New Orleans]]\n* [[Frenchtown, Houston]]\n* [[Magnolia Springs, Alabama]]\n* [[Institute Catholique]]\n* [[7th Ward of New Orleans]]\n* [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]]\n* [[Native Americans in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brasseaux, Carl A.

The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]] consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]] consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Some North American countries, most notably [[Mexico]], do not participate in the NANP.\n\nThe NANP was originally devised in the 1940s by [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] for the [[Bell System]] and independent telephone operators in North America to unify the diverse local numbering plans that had been established in the preceding decades. AT&T continued to administer the numbering plan until the [[breakup of the Bell System]], when administration was delegated to the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA), a service that has been procured from the private sector by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the [[United States]]. Each participating country forms a regulatory authority that has [[plenary power|plenary control]] over local numbering resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/contact_us/NANP_Country_Contacts.pdf|publisher=Neustar|format=PDF|title=Contacts in the Countries Participating in the North American Numbering Plan}}</ref> The FCC also serves as the U.S. regulator. Canadian numbering decisions are made by the [[Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnac.ca/cnac/cna_consortium.htm|title=Canadian Numbering Administrator}}</ref>\n\nThe NANP divides the territories of its members into '''numbering plan areas''' ('''NPAs''') which are encoded numerically with a three-digit telephone number prefix, commonly called the [[area code]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NANPA : Number Resources - NPA (Area) Codes|url=http://www.nanpa.com/area_codes/|accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref> Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit [[telephone number]] unique only within its respective plan area. The telephone number consists of a three-digit [[telephone exchange|central office]] code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). For international call routing, the NANP has been assigned the [[international calling code]] 1 by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU). The North American Numbering Plan conforms with ITU Recommendation [[E.164]], which establishes an international numbering framework.<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Public Telecommunication Numbering Plan|url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.164-201011-I!!PDF-E&type=items|publisher=ITU|accessdate=2015-07-25|author=ITU|author2=ITU-T}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFrom its [[History of the telephone|beginnings]] in 1876 and throughout the first part of the 20th century, the [[Bell System]] grew from essentially local or regional telephone systems. These systems expanded by growing their subscriber bases, as well as increasing their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with [[tie trunk]]s. It was the responsibility of each local administration to design telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth.<ref name=bstj1952>{{cite journal |last1=Nunn |first1=W. H. |year=1952 |title=Nationwide Numbering Plan |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=851\u20139 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1952.tb01412.x}}</ref> As a result, the Bell System as a whole developed into an unorganized system of many differing local numbering systems. The diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for long-distance telephone communication. By the 1940s, the Bell System set out to unify the various numbering plans in existence and developed the North American Numbering Plan as a unified, systematic approach to efficient long-distance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators.\n\nThe new numbering plan was officially accepted in October 1947, dividing most of North America into eighty-six numbering plan areas (NPAs). Each NPA was assigned a numbering plan area code, often abbreviated as ''area code''. These codes were first used by long-distance operators to establish long-distance calls between toll offices. The first customer-dialed direct call using area codes was made on November 10, 1951, from [[Englewood, New Jersey]], to [[Alameda, California]].<ref>[http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/51trans.html 1951: First Direct-Dial Transcontinental Telephone Call], [[AT&T Corporation]].

The mayors made history as they chatted in the first customer-dialed long-distance call, one that introduced area codes.\"</ref> [[Direct distance dialing]] (DDD) was subsequently introduced across the country. By the early 1960s, most areas of the Bell System had been converted and DDD had become commonplace in cities and most larger towns.\n\nIn the following decades, the system expanded to include all of the [[United States]] and its [[Insular area|territories]], [[Canada]], [[Bermuda]], and seventeen nations of the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/about_us/index.html|title=NANPA: North American Numbering Plan Administration - About Us|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mehta|first=Stephanie N.|title=The Kennedy Space Center Acquires A New Area Code: 3-2-1, as in Blast Off |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=1999-02-26}}</ref> By 1967, 129 area codes had been assigned.<ref name=att1968>AT&T, ''Notes on Distance Dialing'' (1968).</ref>\n\nAt the request of the [[Colonial Office|British Colonial Office]], the numbering plan was first expanded to [[Bermuda]] and the [[British West Indies]] because of their historic telecommunications administration through [[Canada]] as parts of the [[British Empire]] and their continued associations with Canada, especially during the years of the telegraph and the [[All Red Line]] system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nNot all North American countries participate in the NANP.

In 1999, the contract was awarded to [[Neustar|Neustar Inc.]], a company spun off from Lockheed for this purpose.

While this required an expansion of most existing local numbering plans, many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed, or even fewer in small communities, the plan was designed to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems. The intent was that most subscribers should not have to dial a long, full national telephone number to make a local telephone call.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Numbering plan areas and central offices{{anchor|numbering plan area}}===\nThe new numbering plan divided the North American continent into regional service areas, each called a numbering plan area (NPA), primarily following the jurisdictional boundaries of [[U.S. states]] and [[Canadian provinces]].<ref name=att1955 /> States or provinces could be divided into multiple areas. NPAs were created in accordance with principles deemed to maximize customer understanding and minimize dialing effort while reducing plant cost.<ref name=ATTnotes>''[[Notes on the Network]]'', AT&T (1980)</ref> Each NPA was identified by a unique three-digit code number, that was prefixed to the local telephone number.\n\nExisting [[telephone exchange]]s and central offices became local exchange points in the nationwide system, each of which was assigned a unique three-digit number unique within its NPA. The combination of NPA code and central office code served as a destination routing code for use by operators and subscribers to reach any central office through the switching network.<ref name=att1955>AT&T (1955) ''Notes on Nationwide Dialing''</ref> Due to the structure of the numbering plan, each NPA was technically limited to 540 central offices.<ref name=ATTnotes />\n\nThis limitation to 540 central offices required the most populous states to be divided into multiple NPAs. [[New York (state)|New York]] state was initially divided into five areas, the most of any state. [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Texas]] were assigned four NPAs each, and [[California]], [[Iowa]], and [[Michigan]] received three. Eight states and provinces were split into two NPAs. These divisions attempted to avoid cutting across busy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an area, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area.<ref name=nunn>W.H. Nunn, ''Nationwide Numbering Plan'', Bell System Technical Journal 31(5), 851 (1952)</ref><ref name=att1955 />\n\nTraditionally, subscribers were assigned four-digit numbers, meaning that each central office could serve up to ten thousand subscriber numbers. Thus the new numbering plan identified each telephone in the system with the combination of area code, central office code, and line number, resulting in a closed [[telephone numbering plan]] with a ten-digit national telephone number for each telephone.<ref name=closednp>AT&T, ''Notes on the Network'', Section 10, p.3 (1980).</ref> The leading part of this address was the area code (three digits), followed by the seven-digit subscriber number consisting of three digits for the central office and four digits for the station. The intent was for subscribers not to have to dial an area code when making a local call or a call within their plan area, resulting in [[seven-digit dialing]]. Area codes were only required in [[ten-digit dialing]] when placing ''foreign area'' calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/61116/why-did-old-phone-numbers-start-letters|title=Why Did Old Phone Numbers Start With Letters?|author=John Greene|date=January 16, 2015|publisher=Mental Floss|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Initial numbering system===\nThe new network design, completed in 1947, provided for 152 area codes, each with a capacity to serve 540 central offices.<ref name=ATTnotes /> Originally only [[List of original NANP area codes|86 area codes]] were assigned.

The allocation of area codes was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas. For example, the [[Indiana]] numbering plan area [[area code 317|317]] was divided to provide a larger numbering pool in the Indiana suburbs of [[Chicago]] ([[area code 219]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nInitially, states divided into multiple numbering plan areas were assigned area codes with the digit ''1'' in the second position, while areas that covered entire states or provinces received codes with ''0'' as the middle digit. This rule was abandoned by the early 1950s.<ref name=att1955 /> To provide for automatic distinction of seven-digit dialing from ten-digit dialing in switching systems, central office codes were restricted to not having a ''0'' or ''1'' in the middle position. This was already common practice, because in the system of using the first two letters of [[central office name|familiar names for central offices]] did not assign letters to digits ''1'' and ''0''. Furthermore, area codes and central office codes could also not start with ''0'' or ''1'', because ''0'' was used for [[operator assistance]] and a leading single pulse, as if produced by the digit ''1'', was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time.<ref name=att1955 /> In addition, the eight codes of the form ''N11'' (''N = 2\u20139'') were reserved as service codes.<ref name=att1968 /> The easily recognizable codes of the form ''N00'' were available in the numbering plan, but were not initially included in assignments.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAdditional area code patterns were later assigned for other services; for example, the area codes ''N10'' were implemented for the [[Telex|Teletypewriter Exchange Service]] (TWX).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com./books?id=u1Y-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA516&lpg=PA516&dq=Teletypewriter+Exchange+Service+N-10&source=bl&ots=NBaPxxylxc&sig=ACfU3U1VnE270UYIYg8k0tSD7-jUkzh25g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV-picyprgAhUNhrwKHfASCtQQ6AEwE3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=Teletypewriter%20Exchange%20Service%20N-10&f=false|title=Statistical Abstract of the United States|year=1960|pages=516|accessdate= February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe central office code was chosen such that it could be represented by the first two letters of the [[telephone exchange name|central office name]] according to a digit-to-letter mapping that was printed on the face of a rotary dial, by grouping a set of letters with the digits ''2'' through ''9''. Such letter translations, designed by W.G. Blauvelt in 1917, had been used in the Bell System in large metropolitan areas since the late 1910s.<ref>Bell Telephone Laboratories, ''A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System - The Early Years (1875-1925)'', M.D. Fagan (ed.), 1975, p.126</ref> The network reorganization eventually resulted in a two-letter, five-digit (2L-5N) representation of telephone numbers for every exchange in North America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Plan of 1960===\n<!-- To be completed... -->\nThe original plan of 1947 had been projected to be usable beyond the year 2000. However, by the late 1950s it became apparent that it would be outgrown by about 1975.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Modern plan===\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NANPA implemented calling procedures that required all long-distance calls within an area code to be prefixed with the area code, in an effort to make it possible to assign central-office prefixes with 0 or 1 in the middle position (except for ''N11''), which would otherwise be wrongly taken by the local [[telephone switch]] to be the area code. As it had nearly run out of area codes using the existing assignment methods, this expanded the number pool for each area code by nearly twenty-five percent and also allowed for the later addition of area codes with middle digits other than 0 or 1.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nRequiring a 1 to be dialed before the full number in some areas also provided for area codes of the form ''N10'', such as 210 in the [[San Antonio]], Texas, area and 410 in eastern [[Maryland]]. Therefore, someone calling from [[San Jose, California]], to [[Los Angeles]] before the change would have dialed 213-555-0123 and after the change 1-213-555-0123, which permitted the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the San Jose area. The preceding 1 also ideally indicates a [[long-distance calling|toll call]]; however, this is inconsistent across the NANP because the FCC has left it to the [[U.S. state]] [[public utilities commission]]s to regulate for traditional [[landline]]s, and it has since become [[Mootness|moot]] for [[mobile phone]]s and digital [[VoIP]] services that now offer nationwide calling without the extra digit.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe NANP number format may be summarized in the notation ''NPA-NXX-xxxx'':\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The number ''234-911-5678'' is invalid, because the central office code must not be in the form N11. ''314-159-2653'' is invalid, because the office code must not begin with ''1''. ''123-234-5678'' is invalid, because the NPA must not begin with 0 or 1.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[country calling code]] for all countries participating in the NANP is ''1''.

The remaining ''555'' numbers are presently unavailable for assignment.\n* In individual geographic area codes, several other NXX prefixes are generally not assigned: the home area code(s), adjacent domestic area codes and overlays, area codes reserved for future relief nearby, industry testing codes (generally NXX 958 and 959) and special service codes (such as NXX 950 and 976).{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}\n\nVarious office codes in certain plan areas are deliberately not issued; for example, numbers {{gaps|212|718-xxxx}}, where 212 and 718 are both [[New York City]] area codes, are typically avoided to prevent confusion between an area code and a similarly numbered local exchange in the same region. 958-xxxx and 959-xxxx are usually test numbers. Using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or seven-digit local number is invalid, as is a 9 as the middle digit of an area code; these are trunk prefixes or reserved for [[North American Numbering Plan expansion]]. Lists of exchanges in an individual area code (posted by CNAC in Canada, NANP in the United States) all list various prefixes as deliberately not issued.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}\n\n===International dialing===\nWhile the national numbering plan of the NANP was designed as a 10-digit closed plan, international direct distance dialing (IDDD) was accomplished by extensive modifications in switching systems to accommodate an open international numbering plan for telephone numbers from seven to twelve digits.<ref>AT&T, ''Notes on the Network'', Section 10.3.02, p.3 (1980).</ref>\n\n==Expansion==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\nCanada and the United States have experienced rapid growth in the number of area codes, particularly between 1990 and 2005. The widespread adoption of [[fax]], [[modem]], and [[mobile phone]] communication, as well as the deregulation of local telecommunication services in the United States in the mid-1990s, increased the demand for telephone numbers.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission allowed telecommunication companies to compete with the [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s for services, usually by forcing the existing sole service provider to lease infrastructure to other local providers. Because of the original design of the numbering plan and the telephone switching network that assumed only a single provider, number allocations had to be made in 10,000-number blocks even when much fewer numbers were required for each new vendor. Due to the proliferation of service providers in some numbering plan areas, many area codes fell into ''jeopardy'', facing exhaustion of numbering resources. The number blocks of failed service providers often remained unused, as no regulatory mechanism existed to reclaim and reassign these numbers.\n\nArea codes are added by two principal methods, number plan area ''splits'' and ''[[overlay plan]]s''. Splits were implemented by dividing an area into two or more regions, one of which retained the existing area code and the other areas receiving a new code. In an overlay, multiple codes are assigned to the same geographical area, obviating the need for renumbering of existing services. Subtle variations of these techniques have been used as well, such as ''dedicated overlays'', in which the new code is reserved for a particular type of service, such as cellular phones and pagers, and ''concentrated overlays'', in which a part of the area retained a single code while the rest of the region received an overlay code. The only service-specific overlay in the NANP was [[area code 917]] (New York City) when it was first installed; such service-specific area code assignments were later prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nMost area codes of the form N10, originally reserved for AT&T's [[Teletypewriter eXchange]] (TWX) service, were transferred to Western Union in 1969 and were freed up for other use in 1981 after conversion to [[Telex|Telex II]] service was complete. The last of these, [[area code 600|610]], was assigned to Canada, but reassigned in 1992. These new area codes, as well as a few other codes used for routing calls to Mexico, were used for telephone area code splits in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as all other area codes under the original plan had been consumed.\n\nAfter the remaining valid area codes were used up by expansion, in 1995 the rapid increase in the need for more area codes forced the NANPA to allow the digits 2 through 8 to be used as a middle digit in new area code assignments, with 9 being reserved as a ''last resort'' for potential future expansion. At the same time, local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit. The first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were [[area code 334]] in Alabama and [[area code 360]] in Washington, which both began service on January 15, 1995. This was quickly followed by [[area code 520]] serving Arizona on March 19, 1995.\n\nCodes ending in double digits are reserved as ''easily recognizable codes'' (ERCs), to be used for special purposes such as toll-free numbers, personal [[area code 500|500]] numbers, Canadian non-geographic [[area code 600]], carrier-specific [[area code 700|700]] numbers, and high-toll [[900 number]]s, rather than for geographic areas. Nevada was denied 777 (\"lucky 7s\", a reference to the state's legalized gambling) for this reason;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vegasinc.com/business/2012/jul/19/new-area-code-being-considered-las-vegas/|title=Additional area code being considered for Las Vegas|date=19 July 2012|publisher=}}</ref> it received [[area code 775|775]] instead when most of Nevada split from [[area code 702|702]], which continues to serve the [[Las Vegas\u2013Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas metropolitan area]].\n\nBy 1995, many cities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] had more than one area code, either from dividing a city into different areas (NPA split) or having more than one code for the same area (NPA overlay). The overlay method requires that the area code must be dialed in all cases, even for local calls, while the split plan may permit seven-digit dialing within the same area. The transition to ten-digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase, which is widely publicized, during which dialing all ten digits is optional. After a period of several months, mandatory dialing begins, when seven-digit dialing is no longer permissible. [[Atlanta]] was the first U.S. city to require mandatory ten-digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area, roughly coinciding with the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] held there. Atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size, but also because it had the world's largest fiber optic network at the time, five times larger than that of [[New York City|New York]], and it was home to [[BellSouth]] (now part of AT&T), then the Southeastern [[Regional Bell Operating Company]], with AT&T's fiber optics manufacturing facility within the city.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right;\"\n! colspan=3 | Common dialing methods\n|-\n|7-digit dialing||NXX xxxx || NPA code not required\n|-\n|10-digit dialing||NPA NXX xxxx ||\n|-\n|11-digit dialing||1 NPA NXX xxxx || ''1'' is the NANP trunk prefix for long-distance circuits\n|}\n\n===Expansion issues===\nDepending on the techniques used for area code expansion, the effect on telephone users varies. In areas in which overlays were used, this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers, so existing directories, business records, letterheads, business cards, advertising, and \"speed-dialing\" settings can retain the same phone numbers, while the overlay is used for new number allocations. The primary impact on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing 10- or 11-digit numbers when only 7-digit dialing was previously permissible.\n\nSplitting instead of overlaying generally avoids the requirement for mandatory area-code dialing, but at the expense of having to convert a region to the new code. In addition to the requirements of updating records and directories to accommodate the new numbers, for efficient conversion this requires a period of \"permissive dialing\" in which the new and old codes are both allowed to work. Also, many splittings involved significant technical issues, especially when the area splittings occurred over boundaries other than phone network divisions.\n\nIn 1998 [[area code 612]], which had covered the [[Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul]] Twin Cities, was split to create [[area code 651]] for [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and the eastern metropolitan area. The [[Minnesota Public Utilities Commission]] mandated that the new boundary exactly follow municipal boundaries, which were distinctly different from telephone exchange boundaries, and that all subscribers keep their 7-digit numbers. These two goals were directly at odds with the reason for the split, namely to provide additional phone numbers. More than 40 exchanges had territory that straddled the new boundary. As a result, prefixes were duplicated in both area codes, which counteracted much of the benefit of the splitting, with only 200 of 700 prefixes in area 612 moving entirely to area 651. In less than two years area code 612 again exhausted its supply of phone numbers, and required a three-way split in 2000, creating the new [[area code 763|area codes 763]] and [[area code 952|952]]. Again, the split followed political boundaries rather than rate center boundaries, resulting in additional split prefixes; a few numbers moved from 612 to 651 and then to 763 in less than two years.\n\n===Decrease in expansion rate===\nRecognizing that the proliferation of area codes was largely due to the telecom regulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of 10,000, the FCC instructed NANPA, by then administered by [[Neustar]], to alleviate the numbering shortage. As a result, [[number pooling]] was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1,000 rather than 10,000. Because of the then design of the switched telephone network, this was a considerable technical obstacle. Number pooling was implemented with another technical obstacle, [[local number portability]].\n\nThe program has been implemented in much of the United States by state regulators. A limited number of cities have also implemented rate center consolidation; fewer rate centers resulted in more efficient use of numbers, as carriers would reserve blocks of 1,000 or 10,000 numbers in each of multiple rate centers in the same area even if they had relatively few clients in the area.<ref>http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/Summary-of-Rate-Center-Consolidations.pdf</ref> (A rate center is a geographical area used by a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) to determine the boundaries for local calling, billing and assigning phone numbers. Typically a call within a rate center is local, while a call from one rate center to another is a long-distance call.) Together with aggressive reclamation of unused number blocks from telecom providers, number pooling has reduced the need for additional area codes, so that many previously designated area splits and overlays have been postponed indefinitely.\n\nThere is no number pooling in Canada. Number allocation remains highly inefficient as even the tiniest village is a rate center and every [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLEC]] is assigned blocks of ten thousand numbers in every place it offers new local service. As a result, dialing seven digits even in remote locations like [[James Bay]] is more likely to produce an [[intercept message]] (\"''dial the area code''\") than an actual voice connection.\n\n===New area codes outside the contiguous United States and Canada===\nBefore 1995, all NANP countries and territories outside the [[contiguous United States]], Alaska, Hawaii and Canada shared the area code 809. This included [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]. Each has since been assigned one or more distinct numbering plan areas; area code [[Telephone numbers in the Dominican Republic|809]] now exclusively serves the [[Dominican Republic]] (along with area codes 829 and 849). The United States Pacific territories of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[Guam]] joined the NANP in 1997, and [[American Samoa]] became an NANP member in October 2004. The Dutch possession of [[Sint Maarten]] was originally scheduled to join the NANP on May 31, 2010, but the changeover was postponed to September 30, 2011.<ref name=\"Sint Maarten delay\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|Bermuda || before 1995: served by area code 809 || 1995: assigned area code 441\n|-\n|Puerto Rico || before 1996: served by area code 809 || 1996: assigned area code 787 \n2001: overlaid with area code 939\n|-\n|U.S. Virgin Islands || before 1997: served by area code 809 || 1997: assigned area code 340\n|-\n|Northern Marianas || before 1997: reached via IDDD using country code 670 || 1997: assigned area code 670\n|-\n|Guam || before 1997: reached via IDDD using country code 671 || 1997: assigned area code 671\n |-\n|American Samoa || before Oct. 1, 2004: reached via IDDD using country code 684 || 2004: assigned area code 684\n |-\n|Sint Maarten || before Sept. 30, 2011: reached via IDDD using country code 599 || 2011: assigned area code 721\n |}\n\n===Number size expansion===\n{{Main article|North American Numbering Plan expansion}}\nThe NANP exhaust analysis estimates that the existing numbering system is sufficient beyond 2049, based on the assumptions that a maximum of 674 NPAs continue to be available, and that on average 3990 central office codes are needed per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalnanpa.com/reports/April_2019_NANP_Exhaust_Analysis_Final.pdf|title=April 2019 North American Numbering Plan (NANP) Exhaust Analysis|author=|date=|website=nationalnanpa.com}}</ref>\n\nIn case of exhaustion, various plans are discussed for expanding the numbering plan. One option is to add the digit 1 or 0 either at the beginning or at the end of the area code, or prefixing it to the seven-digit subscriber number. This would require eleven-digit dialing even for local calls between any two NANP numbers. Another proposal introduces the digit ''9'' into the area code in the format ''x9xx'', so that, for example, [[San Francisco]]'s ''415'' would become ''4915''. Other proposals include reallocating blocks of numbers assigned to smaller long-distance carriers or unused reserved services.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=={{anchor|List of NANPA countries and territories}}Countries and territories==\nOf all states or territories, the U.S. state of California has the largest number of area codes assigned, followed by Texas, Florida and New York, while most countries of the Caribbean use only one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.areacodehelp.com/acus/us_area_codes.shtml|title=United States Area Codes|website=www.areacodehelp.com|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> Many [[Area codes in the Caribbean|Caribbean codes]] were assigned based on alphabetic abbreviations of the territory name, as indicated in the third column of the following table (''Letter code'').

When multiple NPA codes serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/enas/npaDialingPlansReport.do|title=Uniform Dialing Plans|publisher=}}</ref> Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, it may be necessary to prefix a telephone number with ''1''. The NANPA publishes dial plan information for individual area codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalnanpa.com/enas/npasRequiring10DigitReport.do|title=Area Codes Requiring 10 Digit Dialing|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe standard dial plans in most cases are as follows:\n{| class=wikitable\n!\n! Local within area code\n! Local outside area code\n! Toll within area code\n! Toll outside area code\n|-\n|Single code area, with toll alerting\n|7D\n|7D or 10D\n|1+10D\n|1+10D\n|-\n|Single code area, without toll alerting\n|7D\n|1+10D\n|7D or 1+10D\n|1+10D\n|-\n|Overlaid area, with toll alerting\n|10D\n|10D\n|1+10D\n|1+10D\n|-\n|Overlaid area, without toll alerting\n|10D or 1+10D\n|1+10D\n|10D or 1+10D\n|1+10D\n|}\n\nThe number of digits dialed is unrelated to being a local call or a toll call when there is no toll alerting. Allowing 7D local dial across an area code boundary, which is uncommon today, requires [[central office code protection]], locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides.\n\nMost areas permit local calls as 1+10D except for Texas, Georgia, and some jurisdictions in Canada which require that landline callers know which numbers are local and which are toll, dialing 10D for local calls and 1+10D for all toll calls.\n\nIn almost all cases, domestic operator-assisted calls are dialed 0+10D.\n\n===Special numbers and codes===\nSome common special numbers in the North American system:\n* 0 \u2013 [[Operator assistance]]\n* 00 \u2013 [[Long-distance operator]] assistance (formerly 2-1-1)\n* [[011]] \u2013 International access code using direct dial (for all destinations outside the NANP).\n* 01 \u2013 International access code using operator assistance (for all destinations outside the NANP).\n* 101-xxxx \u2013 Used to select use of an alternative [[interexchange carrier|long-distance carrier]]\n* [[2-1-1|211]] \u2013 Local community information or social services (in some cities)\n* [[3-1-1|311]] \u2013 City government or non-emergency police matters\n* [[4-1-1|411]] \u2013 Local telephone directory service (Some telephone companies provide national directory assistance)\n* [[5-1-1|511]] \u2013 Traffic, road, and tourist information\n* [[6-1-1|611]] \u2013 Telephone line repair service (formerly 4104), [[Mobile network operator|wireless operator]] customer service (formerly 811).\n* [[7-1-1|711]] \u2013 Relay service for customers with hearing or speech disabilities.\n* [[8-1-1|811]] \u2013 ''Dig safe'' pipe/cable location in the United States, non-urgent [[telehealth]]/teletriage services in Canada (formerly telephone company business office)\n* [[9-1-1|911]] \u2013 [[Emergency telephone number]] \u2013 fire department, medical emergency, police.\n* 950-xxxx \u2013 [[Feature group]] code for access to a carrier from a non-subscriber location. The feature requires the customer dial a 950-xxxx number and enter a calling card number and destination telephone number. It was originally used for locations where 101-xxxx dialing was not possible.\n* 958-xxxx (local); 959-xxxx (long distance) \u2013 [[Plant test number]]s, such as [[automatic number announcement circuit]]s. It was once common to reserve entire unused exchange prefixes or N11 numbers (4101 was ringback on many step-by-step switches), but these have largely moved to individual unpublished numbers within the standard 958-xxxx (local) or 959-xxxx (long-distance) plant test exchanges as numbers become scarce.\n* 1-NPA-555-1212 \u2013 Non-local directory information (Canada and United States)\n* In December 2019, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed making 9-8-8 a national number in the United States for the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]].<ref>[https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/fcc-988-suicide-prevention-hotline/index.html FCC unanimously approves proposal for new 3-digit number as Suicide Prevention Hotline]</ref>\n\nThere are also [[Vertical service code|special codes]], such as:\n* *51 and 1151: A history of unanswered calls on a telephone number, useful for those who are not [[Caller ID]] subscribers.\n* *57 and 1157:  Used to [[Call tracing|trace]] harassing, threatening, abusive, obscene, etc. phone calls, and keep results of trace at phone company.\n* *66 and 1166: To keep retrying a busy-line (see also [[Called-party camp-on]])\n* *67 and 1167: Caller ID Block\n* *69 and 1169: Call Return ''caller may press '1' to return call after hearing number''\n* *70 and 1170: Cancel call waiting on a call-by-call basis\n* *71 and 1171: Three-way calling, which lets a person talk to people in two different locations at the same time.\n* *74 and 1174: Speed dial, which allows someone to quickly dial any of eight frequently called numbers using a one-digit code, from any phone on their line.\n* *75 allows a total of 30 speed-call numbers with two digits.\n* *77 activates Anonymous Call Rejection Service\n* *82 and 1182: Releases Caller ID block on a call-by-call basis\n* *87 deactivates Anonymous Call Rejection Service\n\n'''Note''': The four-digit numbers are not implemented in some areas. The codes prefixed with an asterisk (*) symbol are intended for use on [[Touch-Tone]] [[telephone]]s, whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are intended for use on [[rotary dial telephone]]s, where the [[Touch-Tone]] '''*''' symbol is not available.\nNot all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the [[emergency telephone number]] is not always 911: [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Dominica]] use [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]], as in the [[United Kingdom]]. The country of [[Barbados]] uses 211 for [[police]] force, 311 for [[fire station|fire]], and 511 for [[ambulance]], while [[Jamaica]] uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for [[police]] force, and 110 for [[fire station|fire]] and [[ambulance]] services.\n\nDespite its early importance as a share of the worldwide telephone system, few of the NANP's codes, such as 911, have been adopted outside the system. Determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on rotary dial telephones, the [[European Union]] has adopted its own standardized number of [[1-1-2|112]], while countries in Asia and the rest of the world use a variety of other two- or three-digit [[emergency telephone number]] combinations. The 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the European [[GSM]] standard. The European Union and many other countries have chosen the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s '''00''' as their international access number instead of 011. The toll-free prefix '''800''' has been widely adopted elsewhere, including as the international toll-free country code. It is often preceded by a 0 rather than a 1 in many countries where 0 is the [[trunk prefix]].\n\n==Alphabetic mnemonic system==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right;\"\n! digit || letters\n| rowspan=9| [[File:Telephone keys.JPG|thumbnail|Letters of the alphabet are mapped to the digits of the telephone dial pad.]]\n|-\n|2 ||ABC\n|-\n|3 ||DEF\n|-\n|4 ||GHI\n|-\n|5 ||JKL\n|-\n|6 ||MNO\n|-\n|7 ||P(Q)RS\n|-\n|8 ||TUV\n|-\n|9 ||WXY(Z)\n|-\n|}\n\nMany dials on modern telephones in use in the NANP service areas maintain the tradition of alphabetic dialing. Usually each pushbutton from digit 2 to 9 also displays three letters, which is standardized in [[ISO/IEC 9995|ISO 9995-8]] and, in Europe, [[E.161]]. Historically, the letters Q and Z were omitted, although some modern telephones contain them. [[Short Message Service|SMS-capable]] devices have all 26 letters. The alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as follows:\n\nNo letters are typically mapped to keys ''1'' and ''0'', although some corporate [[voicemail]] systems use 1 for Q and Z, and some old telephones assigned the Z to the digit 0.\n\n<!-- this should be refactored in historical sequence with previous content -->Originally, this scheme was used as a mnemonic device for telephone number prefixes. When telephone numbers in the United States were standardized in the mid-20th century to seven digits, the first two digits of the exchange prefix were expressed as letters rather than numbers, using the [[telephone exchange name]]. Before [[World War II]], the largest cities used three letters and four or five numbers, while in most cities with customer dialing, phone numbers had only six digits (2L-4N). The prefix was a name, and the first two or three letters, usually shown in capital letters, were dialed. Later, the third letter, where implemented, was replaced by a digit, or an extra digit was added. This generally happened after World War II, although [[New York City]] converted in 1930. The adoption of seven-digit local numbers (2L-5N) was chosen as the requirement for [[direct distance dialing]] and progressively deployed starting the late 1940s.\n\nThe famous [[Glenn Miller]] tune ''[[PEnnsylvania 6-5000]]'' refers to telephone number PE6-5000, a number still in service at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]] (212 736-5000) in New York. Similarly, the classic film ''[[BUtterfield 8]]'' is set in the East Side of [[Manhattan]] between roughly 64th and 86th Streets, where the telephone prefixes include 288. In some works of fiction, phone numbers will begin with \"KLondike 5\" or ''KLamath 5'', which translates to [[555 (telephone number)|555]], an exchange that is reserved for information numbers in North America.\n\nThe letter system was phased out, beginning before 1965, although it persisted ten years later in some places. It was included in [[Bell of Pennsylvania]] directories until 1983. Even today, some businesses still display a 2L-5N number in advertisements, e.g., the Belvedere Construction Company in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] not only still uses the 2L-5N format for its number (TYler 8-7100), it uses the format for the toll-free number (1-800-TY8-7100).\n\nDespite the phasing out of the letter system otherwise, alphabetic [[phoneword]]s remain as a commercial [[mnemonic]] gimmick, particularly for toll-free numbers. For example, one can dial [[1-800-Flowers|1-800-FLOWERS]] to order flowers, or 1-800-DENTIST to find a local dentist.\n\nIn addition to commercial uses, alphabetic dialing has occasionally influenced the choice of regional area codes in the United States. For example, when [[area code 423|area 423]] ([[East Tennessee]]) was split in 1999, the region surrounding [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was assigned [[area code 865]], chosen to represent the word ''VOL'' (''Volunteers''), the nickname of [[Tennessee]] (''The Volunteer State''), as well as athletic teams at the [[University of Tennessee]].<ref>Brewer, Bill.

Only one regional exception exists in [[area code 600]] in Canada.\nIn many other national numbering plans outside the NANP, mobile services are assigned separate prefixes. Cell phone numbers in the NANP are allocated within each area code from special central office prefixes and calls to them are billed at the same rate as any other call. Consequently, the ''caller pays'' pricing model adopted in other countries, in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate, but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user, could not be implemented. Instead, North American cellular telephone subscribers are also generally charged for receiving calls (''subscriber pays''). This has discouraged mobile users from publishing their telephone number. However, price competition among carriers has reduced the average price per call minute for contract customers for both inbound and outbound calls, which compare favorably to those in caller-pays countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Most users select bundle pricing plans that include an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period. Of the four major national carriers in the United States, all four ([[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]]/[[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]) offer free calling between mobile phones on the carrier's network, and Sprint also offers its customers free calling to mobile phones on other networks.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIndustry observers have attributed the relatively low [[mobile phone penetration rate]] in the United States, compared to that of Europe, to the subscriber-pays model.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In this model the convenience of the mobility is charged to the subscriber. Callers from outside the local-calling region of the assigned number, however, pay for a long-distance call, although domestic long-distance rates are generally lower than the rates in caller-pays systems. Conversely, an advantage of caller-pays is the relative absence of [[telemarketing]] and [[nuisance call]]s to mobile numbers. The integrated numbering plan also enables [[local number portability]] between fixed and wireless services within a region, allowing users to switch to mobile service while keeping their telephone number.\n\nThe initial plan for area code overlays did allow for providing separate area codes for use by mobile devices, although these were still assigned to a specific geographical area, and were charged at the same rate as other area codes. Initially, the area code 917 for [[New York City]] was specifically assigned for this purpose within the boroughs; however, a Federal court overturned the practice and the use of an area code for a specific telephony purpose.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} Since mobile telephony has been expanding faster than landline use, new area codes typically have a disproportionately large fraction of mobile and nomadic numbers, although landline and other services rapidly follow and local network portability can blur these distinctions.\n\nThe experience of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and similar events revealed a possible disadvantage of the methods employed in the geographic assignment of cellular numbers. Many mobile phone users could not be reached, even when they were far from the stricken areas, because the routing of calls to their phones depended on equipment in the affected area.

This adds costs for subscribers, as an 8,000&nbsp;km cross-country call (as a worst case) incurs long-distance tolls in both directions. [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] subscribers used to be provided with a local number (such as 1-NPA-NXX-ROAM) in each city, allowing them to be reached by dialing that number plus the ten-digit mobile telephone number; this is no longer supported.\n\n==Toll charges==\nCalls between different countries and territories of the NANP are not typically charged at domestic rates. For example, most long-distance plans may charge a California subscriber a higher rate for a call to British Columbia than for a call to New York, even though both destinations are within the NANP. Similarly, calls from Bermuda to U.S. numbers (including [[Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan|1-800 numbers]], which are normally thought of as [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free]]) incur international rates. This is because many of the island nations implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local phone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international long-distance services.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nBecause of these higher fees, [[scam]]s had taken advantage of customers' unfamiliarity with pricing structure to call the legacy regional area code 809. Some scams lured customers from the United States and Canada into placing expensive calls to the [[Caribbean]], by representing area code [[Telephone numbers in the Dominican Republic|809]] as a regular domestic, low-cost, or toll-free call. The split of 809 (which formerly covered all of the Caribbean NANP points) into multiple new area codes created many new, unfamiliar prefixes which could be mistaken for U.S. or Canada domestic area codes but carried high tariffs. In various island nations, premium exchanges such as +1-876-HOT-, +1-876-WET- or +1-876-SEX- (where 876 is [[Jamaica]]) became a means to circumvent consumer-protection laws governing [[area code 900]] or similar U.S.-domestic premium numbers.\n\nThese scams are on the decline, with many of the [[Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable and Wireless]] service monopolies being opened up to competition, hence bringing rates down. Additionally, many Caribbean territories have implemented local government agencies to regulate telecommunications rates of providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov.bb/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=45|title=Fair Trading Commission, Barbados - Legislation|first=|last=Administrator|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ectel.int/telecoms-regulations.html |title=The Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) > Telecom regulations |access-date=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092807/http://www.ectel.int/telecoms-regulations.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Number portability==\nThe [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] ({{USC|47|251}} (b)(2)) authorizes the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to require all [[local exchange carrier]]s (LECs) to offer [[local number portability]].<ref>11 [[FCC Record|FCC Rcd]] [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2049/m1/397/ 8353]</ref> The FCC regulations were enacted on June 27, 1996, with changes to take effect in the one hundred largest [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s by October 1, 1997 and elsewhere by December 31, 1998.<ref>11 [[FCC Record|FCC Rcd]] [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2049/m1/399/ 8355].

The telephone number consists of a three-digit [[telephone exchange|central office]] code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). For international call routing, the NANP has been assigned the [[international calling code]] 1 by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU). The North American Numbering Plan conforms with ITU Recommendation [[E.164]], which establishes an international numbering framework.<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Public Telecommunication Numbering Plan|url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.164-201011-I!!PDF-E&type=items|publisher=ITU|accessdate=2015-07-25|author=ITU|author2=ITU-T}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFrom its [[History of the telephone|beginnings]] in 1876 and throughout the first part of the 20th century, the [[Bell System]] grew from essentially local or regional telephone systems. These systems expanded by growing their subscriber bases, as well as increasing their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with [[tie trunk]]s. It was the responsibility of each local administration to design telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth.<ref name=bstj1952>{{cite journal |last1=Nunn |first1=W. H. |year=1952 |title=Nationwide Numbering Plan |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=851\u20139 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1952.tb01412.x}}</ref> As a result, the Bell System as a whole developed into an unorganized system of many differing local numbering systems. The diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for long-distance telephone communication. By the 1940s, the Bell System set out to unify the various numbering plans in existence and developed the North American Numbering Plan as a unified, systematic approach to efficient long-distance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators.\n\nThe new numbering plan was officially accepted in October 1947, dividing most of North America into eighty-six numbering plan areas (NPAs). Each NPA was assigned a numbering plan area code, often abbreviated as ''area code''. These codes were first used by long-distance operators to establish long-distance calls between toll offices. The first customer-dialed direct call using area codes was made on November 10, 1951, from [[Englewood, New Jersey]], to [[Alameda, California]].<ref>[http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/51trans.html 1951: First Direct-Dial Transcontinental Telephone Call], [[AT&T Corporation]].

The mayors made history as they chatted in the first customer-dialed long-distance call, one that introduced area codes.\"</ref> [[Direct distance dialing]] (DDD) was subsequently introduced across the country. By the early 1960s, most areas of the Bell System had been converted and DDD had become commonplace in cities and most larger towns.\n\nIn the following decades, the system expanded to include all of the [[United States]] and its [[Insular area|territories]], [[Canada]], [[Bermuda]], and seventeen nations of the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/about_us/index.html|title=NANPA: North American Numbering Plan Administration - About Us|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mehta|first=Stephanie N.|title=The Kennedy Space Center Acquires A New Area Code: 3-2-1, as in Blast Off |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=1999-02-26}}</ref> By 1967, 129 area codes had been assigned.<ref name=att1968>AT&T, ''Notes on Distance Dialing'' (1968).</ref>\n\nAt the request of the [[Colonial Office|British Colonial Office]], the numbering plan was first expanded to [[Bermuda]] and the [[British West Indies]] because of their historic telecommunications administration through [[Canada]] as parts of the [[British Empire]] and their continued associations with Canada, especially during the years of the telegraph and the [[All Red Line]] system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nNot all North American countries participate in the NANP.

While this required an expansion of most existing local numbering plans, many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed, or even fewer in small communities, the plan was designed to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems. The intent was that most subscribers should not have to dial a long, full national telephone number to make a local telephone call.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Numbering plan areas and central offices{{anchor|numbering plan area}}===\nThe new numbering plan divided the North American continent into regional service areas, each called a numbering plan area (NPA), primarily following the jurisdictional boundaries of [[U.S. states]] and [[Canadian provinces]].<ref name=att1955 /> States or provinces could be divided into multiple areas. NPAs were created in accordance with principles deemed to maximize customer understanding and minimize dialing effort while reducing plant cost.<ref name=ATTnotes>''[[Notes on the Network]]'', AT&T (1980)</ref> Each NPA was identified by a unique three-digit code number, that was prefixed to the local telephone number.\n\nExisting [[telephone exchange]]s and central offices became local exchange points in the nationwide system, each of which was assigned a unique three-digit number unique within its NPA. The combination of NPA code and central office code served as a destination routing code for use by operators and subscribers to reach any central office through the switching network.<ref name=att1955>AT&T (1955) ''Notes on Nationwide Dialing''</ref> Due to the structure of the numbering plan, each NPA was technically limited to 540 central offices.<ref name=ATTnotes />\n\nThis limitation to 540 central offices required the most populous states to be divided into multiple NPAs. [[New York (state)|New York]] state was initially divided into five areas, the most of any state. [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Texas]] were assigned four NPAs each, and [[California]], [[Iowa]], and [[Michigan]] received three. Eight states and provinces were split into two NPAs. These divisions attempted to avoid cutting across busy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an area, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area.<ref name=nunn>W.H. Nunn, ''Nationwide Numbering Plan'', Bell System Technical Journal 31(5), 851 (1952)</ref><ref name=att1955 />\n\nTraditionally, subscribers were assigned four-digit numbers, meaning that each central office could serve up to ten thousand subscriber numbers. Thus the new numbering plan identified each telephone in the system with the combination of area code, central office code, and line number, resulting in a closed [[telephone numbering plan]] with a ten-digit national telephone number for each telephone.<ref name=closednp>AT&T, ''Notes on the Network'', Section 10, p.3 (1980).</ref> The leading part of this address was the area code (three digits), followed by the seven-digit subscriber number consisting of three digits for the central office and four digits for the station. The intent was for subscribers not to have to dial an area code when making a local call or a call within their plan area, resulting in [[seven-digit dialing]]. Area codes were only required in [[ten-digit dialing]] when placing ''foreign area'' calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/61116/why-did-old-phone-numbers-start-letters|title=Why Did Old Phone Numbers Start With Letters?|author=John Greene|date=January 16, 2015|publisher=Mental Floss|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Initial numbering system===\nThe new network design, completed in 1947, provided for 152 area codes, each with a capacity to serve 540 central offices.<ref name=ATTnotes /> Originally only [[List of original NANP area codes|86 area codes]] were assigned.

This was already common practice, because in the system of using the first two letters of [[central office name|familiar names for central offices]] did not assign letters to digits ''1'' and ''0''. Furthermore, area codes and central office codes could also not start with ''0'' or ''1'', because ''0'' was used for [[operator assistance]] and a leading single pulse, as if produced by the digit ''1'', was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time.<ref name=att1955 /> In addition, the eight codes of the form ''N11'' (''N = 2\u20139'') were reserved as service codes.<ref name=att1968 /> The easily recognizable codes of the form ''N00'' were available in the numbering plan, but were not initially included in assignments.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAdditional area code patterns were later assigned for other services; for example, the area codes ''N10'' were implemented for the [[Telex|Teletypewriter Exchange Service]] (TWX).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com./books?id=u1Y-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA516&lpg=PA516&dq=Teletypewriter+Exchange+Service+N-10&source=bl&ots=NBaPxxylxc&sig=ACfU3U1VnE270UYIYg8k0tSD7-jUkzh25g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV-picyprgAhUNhrwKHfASCtQQ6AEwE3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=Teletypewriter%20Exchange%20Service%20N-10&f=false|title=Statistical Abstract of the United States|year=1960|pages=516|accessdate= February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe central office code was chosen such that it could be represented by the first two letters of the [[telephone exchange name|central office name]] according to a digit-to-letter mapping that was printed on the face of a rotary dial, by grouping a set of letters with the digits ''2'' through ''9''. Such letter translations, designed by W.G. Blauvelt in 1917, had been used in the Bell System in large metropolitan areas since the late 1910s.<ref>Bell Telephone Laboratories, ''A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System - The Early Years (1875-1925)'', M.D. Fagan (ed.), 1975, p.126</ref> The network reorganization eventually resulted in a two-letter, five-digit (2L-5N) representation of telephone numbers for every exchange in North America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Plan of 1960===\n<!-- To be completed... -->\nThe original plan of 1947 had been projected to be usable beyond the year 2000.

As it had nearly run out of area codes using the existing assignment methods, this expanded the number pool for each area code by nearly twenty-five percent and also allowed for the later addition of area codes with middle digits other than 0 or 1.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nRequiring a 1 to be dialed before the full number in some areas also provided for area codes of the form ''N10'', such as 210 in the [[San Antonio]], Texas, area and 410 in eastern [[Maryland]]. Therefore, someone calling from [[San Jose, California]], to [[Los Angeles]] before the change would have dialed 213-555-0123 and after the change 1-213-555-0123, which permitted the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the San Jose area. The preceding 1 also ideally indicates a [[long-distance calling|toll call]]; however, this is inconsistent across the NANP because the FCC has left it to the [[U.S. state]] [[public utilities commission]]s to regulate for traditional [[landline]]s, and it has since become [[Mootness|moot]] for [[mobile phone]]s and digital [[VoIP]] services that now offer nationwide calling without the extra digit.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe NANP number format may be summarized in the notation ''NPA-NXX-xxxx'':\n{| class=wikitable\n!

In international format, an NANP number should be listed as {{gaps|+1|999|555|0100}}, where ''999'' stands in for the area code.\nEach three-digit area code has a capacity of 7,919,900 telephone numbers:\n\n* NXX may begin only with the digits [2\u20139], providing a base of eight million numbers: (8 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 10000).\n* However, to avoid confusion with the [[N11 code]]s, the last two digits of NXX cannot both be 1.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n* Despite the widespread usage of NXX ''555'' for [[555 (telephone number)|fictional telephone numbers]], the only such numbers now specifically reserved for fictional use are ''555-0100'' through ''555-0199''. The remaining ''555'' numbers are presently unavailable for assignment.\n* In individual geographic area codes, several other NXX prefixes are generally not assigned: the home area code(s), adjacent domestic area codes and overlays, area codes reserved for future relief nearby, industry testing codes (generally NXX 958 and 959) and special service codes (such as NXX 950 and 976).{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}\n\nVarious office codes in certain plan areas are deliberately not issued; for example, numbers {{gaps|212|718-xxxx}}, where 212 and 718 are both [[New York City]] area codes, are typically avoided to prevent confusion between an area code and a similarly numbered local exchange in the same region. 958-xxxx and 959-xxxx are usually test numbers. Using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or seven-digit local number is invalid, as is a 9 as the middle digit of an area code; these are trunk prefixes or reserved for [[North American Numbering Plan expansion]]. Lists of exchanges in an individual area code (posted by CNAC in Canada, NANP in the United States) all list various prefixes as deliberately not issued.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}\n\n===International dialing===\nWhile the national numbering plan of the NANP was designed as a 10-digit closed plan, international direct distance dialing (IDDD) was accomplished by extensive modifications in switching systems to accommodate an open international numbering plan for telephone numbers from seven to twelve digits.<ref>AT&T, ''Notes on the Network'', Section 10.3.02, p.3 (1980).</ref>\n\n==Expansion==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\nCanada and the United States have experienced rapid growth in the number of area codes, particularly between 1990 and 2005. The widespread adoption of [[fax]], [[modem]], and [[mobile phone]] communication, as well as the deregulation of local telecommunication services in the United States in the mid-1990s, increased the demand for telephone numbers.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission allowed telecommunication companies to compete with the [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s for services, usually by forcing the existing sole service provider to lease infrastructure to other local providers. Because of the original design of the numbering plan and the telephone switching network that assumed only a single provider, number allocations had to be made in 10,000-number blocks even when much fewer numbers were required for each new vendor. Due to the proliferation of service providers in some numbering plan areas, many area codes fell into ''jeopardy'', facing exhaustion of numbering resources. The number blocks of failed service providers often remained unused, as no regulatory mechanism existed to reclaim and reassign these numbers.\n\nArea codes are added by two principal methods, number plan area ''splits'' and ''[[overlay plan]]s''. Splits were implemented by dividing an area into two or more regions, one of which retained the existing area code and the other areas receiving a new code. In an overlay, multiple codes are assigned to the same geographical area, obviating the need for renumbering of existing services. Subtle variations of these techniques have been used as well, such as ''dedicated overlays'', in which the new code is reserved for a particular type of service, such as cellular phones and pagers, and ''concentrated overlays'', in which a part of the area retained a single code while the rest of the region received an overlay code. The only service-specific overlay in the NANP was [[area code 917]] (New York City) when it was first installed; such service-specific area code assignments were later prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nMost area codes of the form N10, originally reserved for AT&T's [[Teletypewriter eXchange]] (TWX) service, were transferred to Western Union in 1969 and were freed up for other use in 1981 after conversion to [[Telex|Telex II]] service was complete. The last of these, [[area code 600|610]], was assigned to Canada, but reassigned in 1992. These new area codes, as well as a few other codes used for routing calls to Mexico, were used for telephone area code splits in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as all other area codes under the original plan had been consumed.\n\nAfter the remaining valid area codes were used up by expansion, in 1995 the rapid increase in the need for more area codes forced the NANPA to allow the digits 2 through 8 to be used as a middle digit in new area code assignments, with 9 being reserved as a ''last resort'' for potential future expansion. At the same time, local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit. The first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were [[area code 334]] in Alabama and [[area code 360]] in Washington, which both began service on January 15, 1995. This was quickly followed by [[area code 520]] serving Arizona on March 19, 1995.\n\nCodes ending in double digits are reserved as ''easily recognizable codes'' (ERCs), to be used for special purposes such as toll-free numbers, personal [[area code 500|500]] numbers, Canadian non-geographic [[area code 600]], carrier-specific [[area code 700|700]] numbers, and high-toll [[900 number]]s, rather than for geographic areas. Nevada was denied 777 (\"lucky 7s\", a reference to the state's legalized gambling) for this reason;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vegasinc.com/business/2012/jul/19/new-area-code-being-considered-las-vegas/|title=Additional area code being considered for Las Vegas|date=19 July 2012|publisher=}}</ref> it received [[area code 775|775]] instead when most of Nevada split from [[area code 702|702]], which continues to serve the [[Las Vegas\u2013Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas metropolitan area]].\n\nBy 1995, many cities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] had more than one area code, either from dividing a city into different areas (NPA split) or having more than one code for the same area (NPA overlay). The overlay method requires that the area code must be dialed in all cases, even for local calls, while the split plan may permit seven-digit dialing within the same area. The transition to ten-digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase, which is widely publicized, during which dialing all ten digits is optional. After a period of several months, mandatory dialing begins, when seven-digit dialing is no longer permissible. [[Atlanta]] was the first U.S. city to require mandatory ten-digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area, roughly coinciding with the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] held there. Atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size, but also because it had the world's largest fiber optic network at the time, five times larger than that of [[New York City|New York]], and it was home to [[BellSouth]] (now part of AT&T), then the Southeastern [[Regional Bell Operating Company]], with AT&T's fiber optics manufacturing facility within the city.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right;\"\n! colspan=3 | Common dialing methods\n|-\n|7-digit dialing||NXX xxxx || NPA code not required\n|-\n|10-digit dialing||NPA NXX xxxx ||\n|-\n|11-digit dialing||1 NPA NXX xxxx || ''1'' is the NANP trunk prefix for long-distance circuits\n|}\n\n===Expansion issues===\nDepending on the techniques used for area code expansion, the effect on telephone users varies. In areas in which overlays were used, this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers, so existing directories, business records, letterheads, business cards, advertising, and \"speed-dialing\" settings can retain the same phone numbers, while the overlay is used for new number allocations. The primary impact on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing 10- or 11-digit numbers when only 7-digit dialing was previously permissible.\n\nSplitting instead of overlaying generally avoids the requirement for mandatory area-code dialing, but at the expense of having to convert a region to the new code. In addition to the requirements of updating records and directories to accommodate the new numbers, for efficient conversion this requires a period of \"permissive dialing\" in which the new and old codes are both allowed to work. Also, many splittings involved significant technical issues, especially when the area splittings occurred over boundaries other than phone network divisions.\n\nIn 1998 [[area code 612]], which had covered the [[Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul]] Twin Cities, was split to create [[area code 651]] for [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and the eastern metropolitan area. The [[Minnesota Public Utilities Commission]] mandated that the new boundary exactly follow municipal boundaries, which were distinctly different from telephone exchange boundaries, and that all subscribers keep their 7-digit numbers. These two goals were directly at odds with the reason for the split, namely to provide additional phone numbers. More than 40 exchanges had territory that straddled the new boundary. As a result, prefixes were duplicated in both area codes, which counteracted much of the benefit of the splitting, with only 200 of 700 prefixes in area 612 moving entirely to area 651. In less than two years area code 612 again exhausted its supply of phone numbers, and required a three-way split in 2000, creating the new [[area code 763|area codes 763]] and [[area code 952|952]]. Again, the split followed political boundaries rather than rate center boundaries, resulting in additional split prefixes; a few numbers moved from 612 to 651 and then to 763 in less than two years.\n\n===Decrease in expansion rate===\nRecognizing that the proliferation of area codes was largely due to the telecom regulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of 10,000, the FCC instructed NANPA, by then administered by [[Neustar]], to alleviate the numbering shortage. As a result, [[number pooling]] was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1,000 rather than 10,000. Because of the then design of the switched telephone network, this was a considerable technical obstacle. Number pooling was implemented with another technical obstacle, [[local number portability]].\n\nThe program has been implemented in much of the United States by state regulators. A limited number of cities have also implemented rate center consolidation; fewer rate centers resulted in more efficient use of numbers, as carriers would reserve blocks of 1,000 or 10,000 numbers in each of multiple rate centers in the same area even if they had relatively few clients in the area.<ref>http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/Summary-of-Rate-Center-Consolidations.pdf</ref> (A rate center is a geographical area used by a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) to determine the boundaries for local calling, billing and assigning phone numbers. Typically a call within a rate center is local, while a call from one rate center to another is a long-distance call.) Together with aggressive reclamation of unused number blocks from telecom providers, number pooling has reduced the need for additional area codes, so that many previously designated area splits and overlays have been postponed indefinitely.\n\nThere is no number pooling in Canada. Number allocation remains highly inefficient as even the tiniest village is a rate center and every [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLEC]] is assigned blocks of ten thousand numbers in every place it offers new local service. As a result, dialing seven digits even in remote locations like [[James Bay]] is more likely to produce an [[intercept message]] (\"''dial the area code''\") than an actual voice connection.\n\n===New area codes outside the contiguous United States and Canada===\nBefore 1995, all NANP countries and territories outside the [[contiguous United States]], Alaska, Hawaii and Canada shared the area code 809. This included [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]. Each has since been assigned one or more distinct numbering plan areas; area code [[Telephone numbers in the Dominican Republic|809]] now exclusively serves the [[Dominican Republic]] (along with area codes 829 and 849). The United States Pacific territories of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[Guam]] joined the NANP in 1997, and [[American Samoa]] became an NANP member in October 2004. The Dutch possession of [[Sint Maarten]] was originally scheduled to join the NANP on May 31, 2010, but the changeover was postponed to September 30, 2011.<ref name=\"Sint Maarten delay\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|Bermuda || before 1995: served by area code 809 || 1995: assigned area code 441\n|-\n|Puerto Rico || before 1996: served by area code 809 || 1996: assigned area code 787 \n2001: overlaid with area code 939\n|-\n|U.S. Virgin Islands || before 1997: served by area code 809 || 1997: assigned area code 340\n|-\n|Northern Marianas || before 1997: reached via IDDD using country code 670 || 1997: assigned area code 670\n|-\n|Guam || before 1997: reached via IDDD using country code 671 || 1997: assigned area code 671\n |-\n|American Samoa || before Oct. 1, 2004: reached via IDDD using country code 684 || 2004: assigned area code 684\n |-\n|Sint Maarten || before Sept. 30, 2011: reached via IDDD using country code 599 || 2011: assigned area code 721\n |}\n\n===Number size expansion===\n{{Main article|North American Numbering Plan expansion}}\nThe NANP exhaust analysis estimates that the existing numbering system is sufficient beyond 2049, based on the assumptions that a maximum of 674 NPAs continue to be available, and that on average 3990 central office codes are needed per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalnanpa.com/reports/April_2019_NANP_Exhaust_Analysis_Final.pdf|title=April 2019 North American Numbering Plan (NANP) Exhaust Analysis|author=|date=|website=nationalnanpa.com}}</ref>\n\nIn case of exhaustion, various plans are discussed for expanding the numbering plan. One option is to add the digit 1 or 0 either at the beginning or at the end of the area code, or prefixing it to the seven-digit subscriber number. This would require eleven-digit dialing even for local calls between any two NANP numbers. Another proposal introduces the digit ''9'' into the area code in the format ''x9xx'', so that, for example, [[San Francisco]]'s ''415'' would become ''4915''. Other proposals include reallocating blocks of numbers assigned to smaller long-distance carriers or unused reserved services.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=={{anchor|List of NANPA countries and territories}}Countries and territories==\nOf all states or territories, the U.S. state of California has the largest number of area codes assigned, followed by Texas, Florida and New York, while most countries of the Caribbean use only one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.areacodehelp.com/acus/us_area_codes.shtml|title=United States Area Codes|website=www.areacodehelp.com|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> Many [[Area codes in the Caribbean|Caribbean codes]] were assigned based on alphabetic abbreviations of the territory name, as indicated in the third column of the following table (''Letter code'').

When multiple NPA codes serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/enas/npaDialingPlansReport.do|title=Uniform Dialing Plans|publisher=}}</ref> Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, it may be necessary to prefix a telephone number with ''1''.

Local within area code\n! Local outside area code\n! Toll within area code\n!

Allowing 7D local dial across an area code boundary, which is uncommon today, requires [[central office code protection]], locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides.\n\nMost areas permit local calls as 1+10D except for Texas, Georgia, and some jurisdictions in Canada which require that landline callers know which numbers are local and which are toll, dialing 10D for local calls and 1+10D for all toll calls.\n\nIn almost all cases, domestic operator-assisted calls are dialed 0+10D.\n\n===Special numbers and codes===\nSome common special numbers in the North American system:\n* 0 \u2013 [[Operator assistance]]\n* 00 \u2013 [[Long-distance operator]] assistance (formerly 2-1-1)\n* [[011]] \u2013 International access code using direct dial (for all destinations outside the NANP).\n* 01 \u2013 International access code using operator assistance (for all destinations outside the NANP).\n* 101-xxxx \u2013 Used to select use of an alternative [[interexchange carrier|long-distance carrier]]\n* [[2-1-1|211]] \u2013 Local community information or social services (in some cities)\n* [[3-1-1|311]] \u2013 City government or non-emergency police matters\n* [[4-1-1|411]] \u2013 Local telephone directory service (Some telephone companies provide national directory assistance)\n* [[5-1-1|511]] \u2013 Traffic, road, and tourist information\n* [[6-1-1|611]] \u2013 Telephone line repair service (formerly 4104), [[Mobile network operator|wireless operator]] customer service (formerly 811).\n* [[7-1-1|711]] \u2013 Relay service for customers with hearing or speech disabilities.\n* [[8-1-1|811]] \u2013 ''Dig safe'' pipe/cable location in the United States, non-urgent [[telehealth]]/teletriage services in Canada (formerly telephone company business office)\n* [[9-1-1|911]] \u2013 [[Emergency telephone number]] \u2013 fire department, medical emergency, police.\n* 950-xxxx \u2013 [[Feature group]] code for access to a carrier from a non-subscriber location.

It was once common to reserve entire unused exchange prefixes or N11 numbers (4101 was ringback on many step-by-step switches), but these have largely moved to individual unpublished numbers within the standard 958-xxxx (local) or 959-xxxx (long-distance) plant test exchanges as numbers become scarce.\n* 1-NPA-555-1212 \u2013 Non-local directory information (Canada and United States)\n* In December 2019, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed making 9-8-8 a national number in the United States for the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]].<ref>[https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/fcc-988-suicide-prevention-hotline/index.html FCC unanimously approves proposal for new 3-digit number as Suicide Prevention Hotline]</ref>\n\nThere are also [[Vertical service code|special codes]], such as:\n* *51 and 1151: A history of unanswered calls on a telephone number, useful for those who are not [[Caller ID]] subscribers.\n* *57 and 1157:  Used to [[Call tracing|trace]] harassing, threatening, abusive, obscene, etc. phone calls, and keep results of trace at phone company.\n* *66 and 1166: To keep retrying a busy-line (see also [[Called-party camp-on]])\n* *67 and 1167: Caller ID Block\n* *69 and 1169: Call Return ''caller may press '1' to return call after hearing number''\n* *70 and 1170: Cancel call waiting on a call-by-call basis\n* *71 and 1171: Three-way calling, which lets a person talk to people in two different locations at the same time.\n* *74 and 1174: Speed dial, which allows someone to quickly dial any of eight frequently called numbers using a one-digit code, from any phone on their line.\n* *75 allows a total of 30 speed-call numbers with two digits.\n* *77 activates Anonymous Call Rejection Service\n* *82 and 1182: Releases Caller ID block on a call-by-call basis\n* *87 deactivates Anonymous Call Rejection Service\n\n'''Note''': The four-digit numbers are not implemented in some areas. The codes prefixed with an asterisk (*) symbol are intended for use on [[Touch-Tone]] [[telephone]]s, whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are intended for use on [[rotary dial telephone]]s, where the [[Touch-Tone]] '''*''' symbol is not available.\nNot all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the [[emergency telephone number]] is not always 911: [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Dominica]] use [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]], as in the [[United Kingdom]]. The country of [[Barbados]] uses 211 for [[police]] force, 311 for [[fire station|fire]], and 511 for [[ambulance]], while [[Jamaica]] uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for [[police]] force, and 110 for [[fire station|fire]] and [[ambulance]] services.\n\nDespite its early importance as a share of the worldwide telephone system, few of the NANP's codes, such as 911, have been adopted outside the system. Determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on rotary dial telephones, the [[European Union]] has adopted its own standardized number of [[1-1-2|112]], while countries in Asia and the rest of the world use a variety of other two- or three-digit [[emergency telephone number]] combinations. The 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the European [[GSM]] standard. The European Union and many other countries have chosen the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s '''00''' as their international access number instead of 011. The toll-free prefix '''800''' has been widely adopted elsewhere, including as the international toll-free country code. It is often preceded by a 0 rather than a 1 in many countries where 0 is the [[trunk prefix]].\n\n==Alphabetic mnemonic system==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right;\"\n! digit || letters\n| rowspan=9| [[File:Telephone keys.JPG|thumbnail|Letters of the alphabet are mapped to the digits of the telephone dial pad.]]\n|-\n|2 ||ABC\n|-\n|3 ||DEF\n|-\n|4 ||GHI\n|-\n|5 ||JKL\n|-\n|6 ||MNO\n|-\n|7 ||P(Q)RS\n|-\n|8 ||TUV\n|-\n|9 ||WXY(Z)\n|-\n|}\n\nMany dials on modern telephones in use in the NANP service areas maintain the tradition of alphabetic dialing. Usually each pushbutton from digit 2 to 9 also displays three letters, which is standardized in [[ISO/IEC 9995|ISO 9995-8]] and, in Europe, [[E.161]]. Historically, the letters Q and Z were omitted, although some modern telephones contain them. [[Short Message Service|SMS-capable]] devices have all 26 letters. The alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as follows:\n\nNo letters are typically mapped to keys ''1'' and ''0'', although some corporate [[voicemail]] systems use 1 for Q and Z, and some old telephones assigned the Z to the digit 0.\n\n<!-- this should be refactored in historical sequence with previous content -->Originally, this scheme was used as a mnemonic device for telephone number prefixes. When telephone numbers in the United States were standardized in the mid-20th century to seven digits, the first two digits of the exchange prefix were expressed as letters rather than numbers, using the [[telephone exchange name]]. Before [[World War II]], the largest cities used three letters and four or five numbers, while in most cities with customer dialing, phone numbers had only six digits (2L-4N). The prefix was a name, and the first two or three letters, usually shown in capital letters, were dialed. Later, the third letter, where implemented, was replaced by a digit, or an extra digit was added. This generally happened after World War II, although [[New York City]] converted in 1930. The adoption of seven-digit local numbers (2L-5N) was chosen as the requirement for [[direct distance dialing]] and progressively deployed starting the late 1940s.\n\nThe famous [[Glenn Miller]] tune ''[[PEnnsylvania 6-5000]]'' refers to telephone number PE6-5000, a number still in service at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]] (212 736-5000) in New York. Similarly, the classic film ''[[BUtterfield 8]]'' is set in the East Side of [[Manhattan]] between roughly 64th and 86th Streets, where the telephone prefixes include 288. In some works of fiction, phone numbers will begin with \"KLondike 5\" or ''KLamath 5'', which translates to [[555 (telephone number)|555]], an exchange that is reserved for information numbers in North America.\n\nThe letter system was phased out, beginning before 1965, although it persisted ten years later in some places. It was included in [[Bell of Pennsylvania]] directories until 1983. Even today, some businesses still display a 2L-5N number in advertisements, e.g., the Belvedere Construction Company in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] not only still uses the 2L-5N format for its number (TYler 8-7100), it uses the format for the toll-free number (1-800-TY8-7100).\n\nDespite the phasing out of the letter system otherwise, alphabetic [[phoneword]]s remain as a commercial [[mnemonic]] gimmick, particularly for toll-free numbers. For example, one can dial [[1-800-Flowers|1-800-FLOWERS]] to order flowers, or 1-800-DENTIST to find a local dentist.\n\nIn addition to commercial uses, alphabetic dialing has occasionally influenced the choice of regional area codes in the United States. For example, when [[area code 423|area 423]] ([[East Tennessee]]) was split in 1999, the region surrounding [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was assigned [[area code 865]], chosen to represent the word ''VOL'' (''Volunteers''), the nickname of [[Tennessee]] (''The Volunteer State''), as well as athletic teams at the [[University of Tennessee]].<ref>Brewer, Bill. [https://web.archive.org/web/19991003042549/http://areacode-info.com/headline/1999/tn990417.htm 423 Area Code To Become VOL In 9 ET Counties]. ''Knoxville News-Sentinel''. April 17, 1999.</ref><ref>[http://www.state.tn.us/tra/pressr/1999/vol865.pdf Tennessee Regulatory Authority press release], April 29, 1999</ref> Another example of this is [[area code 859]] in [[Kentucky]], which was chosen to represent 'UKY' as a nod to the [[University of Kentucky]] in [[Lexington, KY]], the code's principal city.\n\nSeveral Caribbean area codes were chosen as an alphabetic abbreviation of the country name, which are indicated in the table of NANP regions.\n\n==Cellular services==\nThe North American Numbering Plan does not set aside special non-geographic area codes exclusively for [[cellular phones]]. Only one regional exception exists in [[area code 600]] in Canada.\nIn many other national numbering plans outside the NANP, mobile services are assigned separate prefixes. Cell phone numbers in the NANP are allocated within each area code from special central office prefixes and calls to them are billed at the same rate as any other call. Consequently, the ''caller pays'' pricing model adopted in other countries, in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate, but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user, could not be implemented. Instead, North American cellular telephone subscribers are also generally charged for receiving calls (''subscriber pays''). This has discouraged mobile users from publishing their telephone number. However, price competition among carriers has reduced the average price per call minute for contract customers for both inbound and outbound calls, which compare favorably to those in caller-pays countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Most users select bundle pricing plans that include an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period. Of the four major national carriers in the United States, all four ([[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]]/[[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]) offer free calling between mobile phones on the carrier's network, and Sprint also offers its customers free calling to mobile phones on other networks.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIndustry observers have attributed the relatively low [[mobile phone penetration rate]] in the United States, compared to that of Europe, to the subscriber-pays model.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In this model the convenience of the mobility is charged to the subscriber. Callers from outside the local-calling region of the assigned number, however, pay for a long-distance call, although domestic long-distance rates are generally lower than the rates in caller-pays systems. Conversely, an advantage of caller-pays is the relative absence of [[telemarketing]] and [[nuisance call]]s to mobile numbers. The integrated numbering plan also enables [[local number portability]] between fixed and wireless services within a region, allowing users to switch to mobile service while keeping their telephone number.\n\nThe initial plan for area code overlays did allow for providing separate area codes for use by mobile devices, although these were still assigned to a specific geographical area, and were charged at the same rate as other area codes. Initially, the area code 917 for [[New York City]] was specifically assigned for this purpose within the boroughs; however, a Federal court overturned the practice and the use of an area code for a specific telephony purpose.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} Since mobile telephony has been expanding faster than landline use, new area codes typically have a disproportionately large fraction of mobile and nomadic numbers, although landline and other services rapidly follow and local network portability can blur these distinctions.\n\nThe experience of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and similar events revealed a possible disadvantage of the methods employed in the geographic assignment of cellular numbers. Many mobile phone users could not be reached, even when they were far from the stricken areas, because the routing of calls to their phones depended on equipment in the affected area. They could make calls but not receive them.<ref>NBC News, [https://www.nbcnews.com/id/9120503/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/katrina-outages-reveal-phone-system-quirks/ \u201cKatrina outages reveal phone system quirks\u201d], retrieved 14 Feb 2018.</ref>\n\nThe use of geographic numbers may also lead to [[anti-tromboning|tromboning]]; one can take a handset with a [[Vancouver]] number into [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and outbound calls to St. John's numbers while in that city will be local, but incoming calls must make the cross-country trip to Vancouver and back. This adds costs for subscribers, as an 8,000&nbsp;km cross-country call (as a worst case) incurs long-distance tolls in both directions. [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] subscribers used to be provided with a local number (such as 1-NPA-NXX-ROAM) in each city, allowing them to be reached by dialing that number plus the ten-digit mobile telephone number; this is no longer supported.\n\n==Toll charges==\nCalls between different countries and territories of the NANP are not typically charged at domestic rates. For example, most long-distance plans may charge a California subscriber a higher rate for a call to British Columbia than for a call to New York, even though both destinations are within the NANP. Similarly, calls from Bermuda to U.S. numbers (including [[Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan|1-800 numbers]], which are normally thought of as [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free]]) incur international rates. This is because many of the island nations implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local phone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international long-distance services.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nBecause of these higher fees, [[scam]]s had taken advantage of customers' unfamiliarity with pricing structure to call the legacy regional area code 809. Some scams lured customers from the United States and Canada into placing expensive calls to the [[Caribbean]], by representing area code [[Telephone numbers in the Dominican Republic|809]] as a regular domestic, low-cost, or toll-free call. The split of 809 (which formerly covered all of the Caribbean NANP points) into multiple new area codes created many new, unfamiliar prefixes which could be mistaken for U.S. or Canada domestic area codes but carried high tariffs. In various island nations, premium exchanges such as +1-876-HOT-, +1-876-WET- or +1-876-SEX- (where 876 is [[Jamaica]]) became a means to circumvent consumer-protection laws governing [[area code 900]] or similar U.S.-domestic premium numbers.\n\nThese scams are on the decline, with many of the [[Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable and Wireless]] service monopolies being opened up to competition, hence bringing rates down. Additionally, many Caribbean territories have implemented local government agencies to regulate telecommunications rates of providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov.bb/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=45|title=Fair Trading Commission, Barbados - Legislation|first=|last=Administrator|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ectel.int/telecoms-regulations.html |title=The Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) > Telecom regulations |access-date=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092807/http://www.ectel.int/telecoms-regulations.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Number portability==\nThe [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] ({{USC|47|251}} (b)(2)) authorizes the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to require all [[local exchange carrier]]s (LECs) to offer [[local number portability]].<ref>11 [[FCC Record|FCC Rcd]] [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2049/m1/397/ 8353]</ref> The FCC regulations were enacted on June 27, 1996, with changes to take effect in the one hundred largest [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s by October 1, 1997 and elsewhere by December 31, 1998.<ref>11 [[FCC Record|FCC Rcd]] [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2049/m1/399/ 8355].

Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Common theories concerning the function of ceratopsian frills and horns include defense from predators, combat within the species, and visual display. A 2009 study of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''Centrosaurus'' skull lesions found that bone injuries on the skulls were more likely caused by intraspecific combat (horn-to-horn combat) rather than predatory attacks. The frills of ''Centrosaurus'' were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid frills of ''Triceratops'' might have evolved to protect their necks. The frills of ''Centrosaurus'' were most likely used \"for species recognition and/or other forms of visual display\".<ref name=\"Farkeetal2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Farke | first1 = A.A. | authorlink3 = Darren Tanke | last2 = Wolff | first2 = E.D.S. | last3 = Tanke | first3 = D.H. | year = 2009 | title = ''Evidence of Combat in ''Triceratops | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = e4252 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004252 | pmid=19172995 | pmc=2617760}}</ref>\n\n== Paleobiogeography ==\nThomas M.

The genus is not to be confused with the [[stegosaur]] ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'', the name of which is derived from the same Greek word.\n\nLater, vast bonebeds of ''Centrosaurus'' were found in [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], also in [[Alberta]]. Some of these beds extend for hundreds of meters and contain thousands of individuals of all ages and all levels of completion.\nScientists have speculated that the high density and number of individuals would be explained if they had perished while trying to cross a flooded river.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaurscentrosaurus\"/> A discovery of thousands of ''Centrosaurus'' fossils near the town of [[Hilda, Alberta|Hilda]], [[Alberta]], is believed to be the largest bed of dinosaur bones ever discovered.

Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Common theories concerning the function of ceratopsian frills and horns include defense from predators, combat within the species, and visual display. A 2009 study of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''Centrosaurus'' skull lesions found that bone injuries on the skulls were more likely caused by intraspecific combat (horn-to-horn combat) rather than predatory attacks. The frills of ''Centrosaurus'' were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid frills of ''Triceratops'' might have evolved to protect their necks. The frills of ''Centrosaurus'' were most likely used \"for species recognition and/or other forms of visual display\".<ref name=\"Farkeetal2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Farke | first1 = A.A. | authorlink3 = Darren Tanke | last2 = Wolff | first2 = E.D.S. | last3 = Tanke | first3 = D.H. | year = 2009 | title = ''Evidence of Combat in ''Triceratops | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = e4252 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004252 | pmid=19172995 | pmc=2617760}}</ref>\n\n== Paleobiogeography ==\nThomas M.

As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by Hamid Gul ([[Jaaved Jaffrey]]), killing all guards around them, with Zafar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zafar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5&nbsp;million rewards for someone to steal the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from the [[Tower of London]], but with one condition \u2013 the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a man named Rajveer Nanda ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) steals it, and when Zafar's men, led by Shoaib Hakhsar ([[Ankur Vikal]]) are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5&nbsp; million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20&nbsp; million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zafar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in [[Shimla]]. Following an escape, he sees a young lady, Harleen Sahni ([[Katrina Kaif]]) sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, \"Vickie Kapoor\", to show up. Rajveer enters the restaurant posing as \"Vickie\" and woos her over. He convinces Harleen to use the bathroom and while she is in there, Rajveer fights the remaining men who came searching for him and leaves the restaurant, much to the dismay of Harleen. As she drives home, Harleen accidentally runs over Rajveer, who asks her to stitch up a gunshot wound sustained during the fight. Rajveer then gives Harleen drugged water, with her complying with what he says about a few government officials, informing her about where to find guns underneath some car seat and what they will say about him.\n\nThe next day indeed, some government officials led by Zorawar Kalra ([[Pawan Malhotra]]) visit Harleen at her bank and threaten her to come with them. They tell her that if she does not accompany them, then they will reveal everything to her colleagues. Harleen decides to go with them to the police station. In the car, Zorawar tells her that they are not going to the station but they are taking her to a safe place instead. Harleen remembers about the gun that Rajveer had told her of. She engages the other official in small talk and finds the gun. She threatens both the officers to stop the car and let her go. At the same time, Rajveer appears on a bike and a chase sequence ensues. Both Rajveer and Harleen find a car and escape. When Rajveer goes out to shoot the goons, Harleen escapes and then bumps into her boss, Karan. She tells him about Rajveer and how random people are firing at her. Rajveer follows her. Karan tries to protect Harleen from Rajveer. He annoys Rajveer and gets shot by him in the leg. Harleen is exasperated but leaves with Rajveer again lest he shoots any more people.\n\nIn the car, Harleen and Rajveer get into an argument. Harleen states that she wants to go home and that she had made a huge mistake by trusting him. Rajveer angrily decides to let Harleen go and hands over the car keys to her. He tells her that he has no other motive than protecting her. She feels guilty and decides to stick to him. They begin to drive again in silence. Rajveer checks a location on his phone which Harleen notices. He then tells her that he has not killed an innocent person before this and does not want her to die. He tries to convince her to come with him for dinner.\n\nThey go to a restaurant where Rajveer realises that he has no money to buy food. They get into an argument about it. He teases Harleen about her internet dating and she slaps him. He threatens to shoot the server and she eventually pays for the pizza. Harleen asks him about the crime that he has committed and Rajveer shows her the Koh-i-Noor much to her surprise. She has a hard time believing that he is indeed a thief. As she comes to know about Rajveer, they realise that they were followed by Zorawar who says he has the restaurant surrounded with his men and will not be afraid to shoot Rajveer if needed to. As the officials convince Harleen to go with them, Rajveer tells Harleen that he cannot let her go with them. He shoots her with a tranquilizer dart and they both jump out of a window and escape.\n\nHarleen slips in and out of consciousness as Rajveer continues to take her to safety. She wakes up in a beach shack wearing a bikini top and shorts. She angrily asks Rajveer as to who changed her clothes and he confesses that he did it. She is angry beyond words. She beats him and bites his hand. Harleen then takes Rajveer's phone to call her grandmother, unbeknownst to her it allows the government officials to track their position. After a shootout occurs between Rajveer and the government officials, he escapes with Harleen with a help of a sea bob and a fly board.\n\nHarleen wakes up the next morning in [[Prague]]. As Rajveer was able to successfully lead the escape of them both, Harleen now entrusts Rajveer, subsequently falling in love with him. When Rajveer goes out of his hotel with Harleen, he sees that they are wanted by [[Interpol]]. Some policemen come at the moment and, in the process of concealing their faces, Rajveer and Harleen end up sharing a passionate kiss. Rajveer tracks Hamid Gul at a casino. Although he was to go alone, Harleen insists to take her along, to which he agrees. Staging a ploy for Gul's attention, Harleen and Gul meet in the hallway, where he tells her that a romantic candlelit champagne drink is waiting for her on the roof of the casino. Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, and a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zafar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime, Harleen spots Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul, and gives her a tracking device. Harleen is asked to get the Koh-i-Noor back. That night, Rajveer picks up Harleen at the entrance of a hotel where they had been staying, and they begin walking through a bridge, where Harleen says that the trust between them is broken, and that she knows about Gul's murder. Rajveer activates the tracking device himself, allowing the officials to surround them. Rajveer gives the Koh-i-Noor to Harleen and jumps from the bridge, but is shot, and is assumed dead.\n\nHarleen then returns home and remembers the address location that Rajveer was viewing on his phone. At the address, she meets Rajveer's father Pankaj ([[Kanwaljit Singh (actor)|Kanwaljit Singh]]) and his mother Shikha ([[Deepti Naval]]). At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Shikha reveals their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Pankaj says that he does not believe in the story the army told him, saying that Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda, Viren's brother, who is disguised as Rajveer, had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, as he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by someone and next lands up in a fortress, where she meets Zafar, who learns and reveals that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zafar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth serum drug to reveal the location of the real diamond. Harleen deduces that Rajveer would have survived and is coming to kill Zafar. Jaiwant, in the meantime, is revealed to have actually survived, and silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zafar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zafar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and the [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian Secret Service]] to get Zafar. The time bombs go off and destroy the castle, but Zafar manages to escape and captures Harleen again after making Rajveer crash. As they escape with her, Jaiwant follows them with a [[Formula One car|F1 car]] and catches up to them. Zafar enters a flight with Harleen. Killing the rest of Zafar's men including Zorawar, Jaiwant shoots at the flight blades evidently grounding the plane. He soon boards the plane and a final bout takes place between him and Zafar. After throwing him to the flames, Jaiwant frees Harleen. When they are escaping from the aircraft, Zafar emerges from the flames again and shoots Rajveer. Jaiwant pushes Harleen out of the aircraft and a second bullet hits him. He then grabs the axe and charges towards Zafar and kills him. When the aircraft is about to explode, he jumps out.\n\nHe loses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Jaiwant and Harleen.\n\nJaiwant then wakes up in hospital, where his commandant Narayanan ([[Vikram Gokhale]]) is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that Viren was murdered and that Pankaj and Shikha will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After Narayanan leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Jaiwant a medicine to drink. As soon as he gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine was a sedative meant to knock Jaiwant out. A surprised Jaiwant tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Jaiwant faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his one-day has arrived. Jaiwant realises that she has brought him to his house. He silently thanks her, and they both reunite with Pankaj and Shikha.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as '''Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda''' a.k.a.

As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by Hamid Gul ([[Jaaved Jaffrey]]), killing all guards around them, with Zafar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zafar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5&nbsp;million rewards for someone to steal the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from the [[Tower of London]], but with one condition \u2013 the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a man named Rajveer Nanda ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) steals it, and when Zafar's men, led by Shoaib Hakhsar ([[Ankur Vikal]]) are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5&nbsp; million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20&nbsp; million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zafar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in [[Shimla]]. Following an escape, he sees a young lady, Harleen Sahni ([[Katrina Kaif]]) sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, \"Vickie Kapoor\", to show up. Rajveer enters the restaurant posing as \"Vickie\" and woos her over. He convinces Harleen to use the bathroom and while she is in there, Rajveer fights the remaining men who came searching for him and leaves the restaurant, much to the dismay of Harleen. As she drives home, Harleen accidentally runs over Rajveer, who asks her to stitch up a gunshot wound sustained during the fight. Rajveer then gives Harleen drugged water, with her complying with what he says about a few government officials, informing her about where to find guns underneath some car seat and what they will say about him.\n\nThe next day indeed, some government officials led by Zorawar Kalra ([[Pawan Malhotra]]) visit Harleen at her bank and threaten her to come with them. They tell her that if she does not accompany them, then they will reveal everything to her colleagues. Harleen decides to go with them to the police station. In the car, Zorawar tells her that they are not going to the station but they are taking her to a safe place instead. Harleen remembers about the gun that Rajveer had told her of. She engages the other official in small talk and finds the gun. She threatens both the officers to stop the car and let her go. At the same time, Rajveer appears on a bike and a chase sequence ensues. Both Rajveer and Harleen find a car and escape. When Rajveer goes out to shoot the goons, Harleen escapes and then bumps into her boss, Karan. She tells him about Rajveer and how random people are firing at her. Rajveer follows her. Karan tries to protect Harleen from Rajveer. He annoys Rajveer and gets shot by him in the leg. Harleen is exasperated but leaves with Rajveer again lest he shoots any more people.\n\nIn the car, Harleen and Rajveer get into an argument. Harleen states that she wants to go home and that she had made a huge mistake by trusting him. Rajveer angrily decides to let Harleen go and hands over the car keys to her. He tells her that he has no other motive than protecting her. She feels guilty and decides to stick to him. They begin to drive again in silence. Rajveer checks a location on his phone which Harleen notices. He then tells her that he has not killed an innocent person before this and does not want her to die. He tries to convince her to come with him for dinner.\n\nThey go to a restaurant where Rajveer realises that he has no money to buy food. They get into an argument about it. He teases Harleen about her internet dating and she slaps him. He threatens to shoot the server and she eventually pays for the pizza. Harleen asks him about the crime that he has committed and Rajveer shows her the Koh-i-Noor much to her surprise. She has a hard time believing that he is indeed a thief. As she comes to know about Rajveer, they realise that they were followed by Zorawar who says he has the restaurant surrounded with his men and will not be afraid to shoot Rajveer if needed to. As the officials convince Harleen to go with them, Rajveer tells Harleen that he cannot let her go with them. He shoots her with a tranquilizer dart and they both jump out of a window and escape.\n\nHarleen slips in and out of consciousness as Rajveer continues to take her to safety. She wakes up in a beach shack wearing a bikini top and shorts. She angrily asks Rajveer as to who changed her clothes and he confesses that he did it. She is angry beyond words. She beats him and bites his hand. Harleen then takes Rajveer's phone to call her grandmother, unbeknownst to her it allows the government officials to track their position. After a shootout occurs between Rajveer and the government officials, he escapes with Harleen with a help of a sea bob and a fly board.\n\nHarleen wakes up the next morning in [[Prague]]. As Rajveer was able to successfully lead the escape of them both, Harleen now entrusts Rajveer, subsequently falling in love with him. When Rajveer goes out of his hotel with Harleen, he sees that they are wanted by [[Interpol]]. Some policemen come at the moment and, in the process of concealing their faces, Rajveer and Harleen end up sharing a passionate kiss. Rajveer tracks Hamid Gul at a casino. Although he was to go alone, Harleen insists to take her along, to which he agrees. Staging a ploy for Gul's attention, Harleen and Gul meet in the hallway, where he tells her that a romantic candlelit champagne drink is waiting for her on the roof of the casino. Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, and a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zafar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime, Harleen spots Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul, and gives her a tracking device. Harleen is asked to get the Koh-i-Noor back. That night, Rajveer picks up Harleen at the entrance of a hotel where they had been staying, and they begin walking through a bridge, where Harleen says that the trust between them is broken, and that she knows about Gul's murder. Rajveer activates the tracking device himself, allowing the officials to surround them. Rajveer gives the Koh-i-Noor to Harleen and jumps from the bridge, but is shot, and is assumed dead.\n\nHarleen then returns home and remembers the address location that Rajveer was viewing on his phone. At the address, she meets Rajveer's father Pankaj ([[Kanwaljit Singh (actor)|Kanwaljit Singh]]) and his mother Shikha ([[Deepti Naval]]). At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Shikha reveals their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Pankaj says that he does not believe in the story the army told him, saying that Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda, Viren's brother, who is disguised as Rajveer, had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, as he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by someone and next lands up in a fortress, where she meets Zafar, who learns and reveals that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zafar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth serum drug to reveal the location of the real diamond. Harleen deduces that Rajveer would have survived and is coming to kill Zafar. Jaiwant, in the meantime, is revealed to have actually survived, and silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zafar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zafar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and the [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian Secret Service]] to get Zafar. The time bombs go off and destroy the castle, but Zafar manages to escape and captures Harleen again after making Rajveer crash. As they escape with her, Jaiwant follows them with a [[Formula One car|F1 car]] and catches up to them. Zafar enters a flight with Harleen. Killing the rest of Zafar's men including Zorawar, Jaiwant shoots at the flight blades evidently grounding the plane. He soon boards the plane and a final bout takes place between him and Zafar. After throwing him to the flames, Jaiwant frees Harleen. When they are escaping from the aircraft, Zafar emerges from the flames again and shoots Rajveer. Jaiwant pushes Harleen out of the aircraft and a second bullet hits him. He then grabs the axe and charges towards Zafar and kills him. When the aircraft is about to explode, he jumps out.\n\nHe loses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Jaiwant and Harleen.\n\nJaiwant then wakes up in hospital, where his commandant Narayanan ([[Vikram Gokhale]]) is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that Viren was murdered and that Pankaj and Shikha will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After Narayanan leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Jaiwant a medicine to drink. As soon as he gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine was a sedative meant to knock Jaiwant out. A surprised Jaiwant tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Jaiwant faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his one-day has arrived. Jaiwant realises that she has brought him to his house. He silently thanks her, and they both reunite with Pankaj and Shikha.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as '''Jaiwant \"Jai\" Nanda''' a.k.a.
