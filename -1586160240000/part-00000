This is the name by which he was known to his Egyptian subjects, and the name used uniformly in Egyptian and Arabic language historical scholarship.

Current English-language historical scholarship is divided as to which is preferable, with the majority opinion favoring the former.

At the height of his rule, he controlled [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and [[Arabia|parts of Arabia]] and the entire [[Levant]]. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt.\n\nMuhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], [[Macedonia (region)|Ottoman Macedonia]] to a family of [[Kurdish ethnicity|Kurdish]] origins. He was a military commander in an Albanian Ottoman force sent to recover Egypt from a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French occupation]] under [[Napoleon]]. Following Napoleon's withdrawal, Muhammad Ali rose to power through a series of political maneuvers, and in 1805 he was named ''[[W\u0101li]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt and gained the rank of [[Pasha]].\n\nAs ''W\u0101li'', Muhammad Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the [[Mamluk]]s, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.\n\nMilitarily, Muhammad Ali [[Wahhabi War|recaptured the Arabian territories]] for the sultan, and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquered Sudan]] on his own accord. His attempt at suppressing the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] failed decisively, however, following an intervention by the European powers at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]]. In 1831, Muhammad Ali [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|waged war against the sultan]], capturing Syria, crossing into Anatolia and directly threatening [[Constantinople]] but Western Powers threatened him to retreat. He did the same invasion against the Ottoman Empire in 1840 , when he defeated again the Ottomans and had a free way to capture Istanbul. Faced with another European intervention, he accepted a brokered peace in 1842 and withdrew from the Levant; in return, he and his descendants were granted hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan. The [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] he established would rule Egypt until the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n<!--these paragraphs refer to \"he\", but the text shows that \"he\" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.

He was born to an [[Kurdish ethnicity|Kurdish]] family whose origins were from [[Diyarbak\u0131r|Amed]].

[[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.<ref>Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.</ref> During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.<ref name=Little57>Little, 57.</ref> As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. In 1801, he allied with the [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]ian leader [[Umar Makram]] and Egypt's [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]]. During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.<ref>P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] (scholars, savants) demanded the replacement of ''W\u0101li'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.<ref name=Little57/>\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali's ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.\n\n[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]\nThe Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali's approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on 1 March 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.<ref>Cleveland, 67.</ref><ref>H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.</ref>}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.\n\nMuhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:\n\n{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.<ref>Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)</ref>}}\n\n== Reinventing Egypt ==\n\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789\u20131807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, but unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.<ref>William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.<ref>Cleveland, 62.</ref> To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy</ref>\n\nHis first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.<ref>Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels - Sketch for the portrait of Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt.jpg|thumb|left|''Muhammad Ali'' by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]], 1847]]\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corv\u00e9e]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.<ref>Little, 59; Cleveland, 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nIn addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt's war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.<ref name=Cleveland69>Cleveland, 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after the [[Ecole Polytechnique]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.\n\n[[File:\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627.JPG|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in [[Cairo]].]]\n\nBeyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.\n\nA by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nA 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=1 February 2015|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79\u2013100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mehemed Ali Egypt.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt, drawn by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]].]]\n\n== Law under Muhammad Ali ==\nThe purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133</ref> Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt. Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in 1829, in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population. By this time, Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state, which he first expressed in 1830, by creating a state of \"law and order\", where Christians within Egypt can be safe, which was a way Muhammad Ali was able to pull influence from Europe.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|date=1 January 1999|title=The Anatomy of Justice: Forensic Medicine and Criminal Law in Nineteenth-Century Egypt|jstor=3399313|journal=Islamic Law and Society|volume=6|issue=2|pages=224\u2013271}}</ref> He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan.

The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons.<ref>M. Paul Merruau, ''L\u2019Egypte Contemporaine de Mehemet-ali a Said Pacha'',\nParis, Librarie Internationale, 1860, p. 84.</ref>\n \nThe medical school for women would produce hakimas, \"doctoress\",<ref name=\":0\" /> to treat women and children. French women adherents of the [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] social reform movement were living in Egypt during 1833-36 and studied or provided medical care under Clot Bey's direction. French ''sage-femme'' (midwife) [[Suzanne Voilquin]] writes of assisting during the cholera epidemic of 1834.<ref>Voilquin, Suzanne.

Maspero, 1978.</ref> Several of the French women contracted cholera and died.\n\nAli's military and economic goals required a healthy army and population from which young boys could be conscripted. Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates. Clot Bey argued that female-provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population.<ref name=\":0\" /> He believed that the untrained local dayas (midwives) were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law, male doctors could not treat women.<ref name=\":1\">Kozma, Liat.

Web. 24 May 2016.</ref> Clot Bey's solution was a school to train female doctors.\n\nThe school of medicine for women followed a French model. The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines. Students were provided housing, food, clothes and a monthly allowance from the state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGraduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt.

Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Role in the Arabic literary renaissance ==\nIn the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational \"mission\" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].\n\nTo support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek \u2013 Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].\n\nIn 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the B\u016bl\u0101q Press under Muhammad 'Al\u012b of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129\u2013132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448|jstor=600448}}</ref>  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.\n\nAmong his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]\n\nThough Muhammad Ali's chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt</ref> The army often used the [[bastinado]] and the [[Flagellation|whip]] to control and punish the soldiers.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127</ref> Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref> A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142\u2013146.</ref> Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.</ref> This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.</ref>\nThe soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123</ref> In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124</ref>\n\n=== Arabian campaign ===\n{{Main|Wahhabi War}}\n\nMuhammad Ali's first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.\n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman\u2013Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal \u2018Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhile the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.<ref>Dodwell, 48.</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Sudan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)}}\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.<ref>Dodwell, 51.</ref> Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan.<ref>Emanuel Be\u0161ka, ''Muhammad Ali\u00b4s Conquest of Sudan (1820-1824)''. Asian and African Studies, 2019, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 30-56.</ref> Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.\n\n=== Greek rebellion ===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph S\u00e8ve (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Dodwell, 71.</ref> Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.\n\n=== War against the sultan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)}}\n\nIn compensation for his loss at Navarino, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.<ref>12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828</ref> But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.\n\nLike other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the W\u0101li since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The W\u0101li alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corv\u00e9e, and taxes, and he wanted them back.<ref>Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983</ref> (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])\n\nThe Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan's name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.<ref>Dodwell, 111.</ref> So long as Muhammad Ali's march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.<ref>Dodwell, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]].<ref>Cleveland, 72.</ref> Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].<ref name= Kupchan >{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}</ref> The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.<ref>Dodwell, 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n[[File:Interview with Mehemet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria, by David Roberts and Louis Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839), with [[Patrick Campbell (British Army officer, born 1779)|Patrick Campbell]] in the centre. After [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in [[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]]]\nSensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.<ref name=Vatikiotis66>Vatikiotis, 66.</ref> Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.\n\nOn 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Dodwell, 171.</ref> This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> With Muhammad Ali's intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.\n\nWhen Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.\n\nAt this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.<ref>Jarvis, 134.</ref> In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.\n\nAfter the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].<ref>Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\n[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nAfter 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.<ref>\"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...\", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the W\u0101li the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&nbsp;million francs (\u00a32,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres{{efn|A [[Kuru\u015f|piastre]] is forty ''[[Para (currency)|paras]]''. A ''para'' is the smallest Egyptian silver coin. In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.<ref>Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref> Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, \u0130brahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.\n\nA year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: \"[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?\"<ref>Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.</ref>\nAfter he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.\n\n[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]\n\nIt soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].\n\nBy this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].\n\nBut the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w\u0101li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.\n\nEyewitness British consul John Murray wrote:\n<blockquote>... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed \u2013 in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.\n\n<br>...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.<ref>F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]\n\nThe prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.<ref>The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad \u2018Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition'', trans.

He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and throughout his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous.

[[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, in the case of some important works,<ref>For example, Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad 'Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1931)</ref> the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the 1970s.

At the height of his rule, he controlled [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and [[Arabia|parts of Arabia]] and the entire [[Levant]]. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt.\n\nMuhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], [[Macedonia (region)|Ottoman Macedonia]] to a family of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origins. He was a military commander in an Albanian Ottoman force sent to recover Egypt from a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French occupation]] under [[Napoleon]]. Following Napoleon's withdrawal, Muhammad Ali rose to power through a series of political maneuvers, and in 1805 he was named ''[[W\u0101li]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt and gained the rank of [[Pasha]].\n\nAs ''W\u0101li'', Muhammad Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the [[Mamluk]]s, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.\n\nMilitarily, Muhammad Ali [[Wahhabi War|recaptured the Arabian territories]] for the sultan, and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquered Sudan]] on his own accord. His attempt at suppressing the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] failed decisively, however, following an intervention by the European powers at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]]. In 1831, Muhammad Ali [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|waged war against the sultan]], capturing Syria, crossing into Anatolia and directly threatening [[Constantinople]] but Western Powers threatened him to retreat. He did the same invasion against the Ottoman Empire in 1840 , when he defeated again the Ottomans and had a free way to capture Istanbul. Faced with another European intervention, he accepted a brokered peace in 1842 and withdrew from the Levant; in return, he and his descendants were granted hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan. The [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] he established would rule Egypt until the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n<!--these paragraphs refer to \"he\", but the text shows that \"he\" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.

[[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.<ref>Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.</ref> During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.<ref name=Little57>Little, 57.</ref> As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. In 1801, he allied with the [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]ian leader [[Umar Makram]] and Egypt's [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]]. During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.<ref>P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] (scholars, savants) demanded the replacement of ''W\u0101li'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.<ref name=Little57/>\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali's ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.\n\n[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]\nThe Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali's approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on 1 March 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.<ref>Cleveland, 67.</ref><ref>H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.</ref>}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.\n\nMuhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:\n\n{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.<ref>Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)</ref>}}\n\n== Reinventing Egypt ==\n\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789\u20131807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, but unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.<ref>William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.<ref>Cleveland, 62.</ref> To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy</ref>\n\nHis first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.<ref>Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels - Sketch for the portrait of Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt.jpg|thumb|left|''Muhammad Ali'' by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]], 1847]]\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corv\u00e9e]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.<ref>Little, 59; Cleveland, 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nIn addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt's war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.<ref name=Cleveland69>Cleveland, 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after the [[Ecole Polytechnique]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.\n\n[[File:\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627.JPG|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in [[Cairo]].]]\n\nBeyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.\n\nA by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nA 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=1 February 2015|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79\u2013100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mehemed Ali Egypt.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt, drawn by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]].]]\n\n== Law under Muhammad Ali ==\nThe purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133</ref> Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt. Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in 1829, in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population. By this time, Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state, which he first expressed in 1830, by creating a state of \"law and order\", where Christians within Egypt can be safe, which was a way Muhammad Ali was able to pull influence from Europe.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|date=1 January 1999|title=The Anatomy of Justice: Forensic Medicine and Criminal Law in Nineteenth-Century Egypt|jstor=3399313|journal=Islamic Law and Society|volume=6|issue=2|pages=224\u2013271}}</ref> He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan. He implemented a police force, mostly well known within Cairo and Alexandria, that functioned not just as a form of authority over the law, but also as a form of a public prosecutor's office.<ref name=\":3\" /> Renovation of evidence used within the courts, that previously would not be used, started to be part of the system, the biggest one being autopsy reports, becoming an important asset among investigations and trials alike. With the use of non Shari'a evidence allowed the process of law to work around the strict Shari'a rule of evidence, which restricted the use of certain forms of evidence.<ref name=\":3\" /> Autopsy became an important form of evidence used within criminal law in Egypt, even being used after Muhammad's reign amongst his successors in the 1850s.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Hakimas and the school of medicine for women ==\nIn 1832, Muhammad Ali allowed [[Antoine Clot]], known as \"Clot Bey\" in Egypt, to establish a School of Medicine for women.<ref name=\":0\">Kuhnke, LaVerne. ''Lives at Risk: Public Health in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.'' Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1990. <nowiki>http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft5t1nb3mq/</nowiki></ref> Clot-Bey had been invited in 1827 by Muhammad Ali to found the Qasral-\u2018Ayni School of Medicine at the Army hospital of Abou Zabel which later transferred to Cairo. The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons.<ref>M. Paul Merruau, ''L\u2019Egypte Contemporaine de Mehemet-ali a Said Pacha'',\nParis, Librarie Internationale, 1860, p. 84.</ref>\n \nThe medical school for women would produce hakimas, \"doctoress\",<ref name=\":0\" /> to treat women and children. French women adherents of the [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] social reform movement were living in Egypt during 1833-36 and studied or provided medical care under Clot Bey's direction. French ''sage-femme'' (midwife) [[Suzanne Voilquin]] writes of assisting during the cholera epidemic of 1834.<ref>Voilquin, Suzanne. ''Souvenirs d'une fille du peuple: ou, La Saint-Simonienne en Egypte'', Intro by Lydia Elhadad. Paris: F. Maspero, 1978.</ref> Several of the French women contracted cholera and died.\n\nAli's military and economic goals required a healthy army and population from which young boys could be conscripted. Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates. Clot Bey argued that female-provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population.<ref name=\":0\" /> He believed that the untrained local dayas (midwives) were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law, male doctors could not treat women.<ref name=\":1\">Kozma, Liat. ''Policing Egyptian Women: Sex, Law, and Medicine in Khedival Egypt''. Syracuse, NY, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2011. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 24 May 2016.</ref> Clot Bey's solution was a school to train female doctors.\n\nThe school of medicine for women followed a French model. The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines. Students were provided housing, food, clothes and a monthly allowance from the state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGraduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt. Some stayed at the school to serve as instructors.<ref name=\":0\" /> Marriages were arranged by the state to male doctors. Once married, hakimas were given the title of [[Effendi]], the rank of second lieutenant, and a monthly salary of 250 piasters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLicensed hakimas treated women and children, providing vaccinations and delivering children. They served a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of smallpox during the 19th century by vaccinating approximately 600 children a month in the Civil Hospital.<ref name=\":0\" /> They checked and treated women, mainly prostitutes, for venereal diseases.<ref name=\":2\">Fahmy, Khaled. \u201cWomen, Medicine, and Power in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.\u201d ''Remaking Women: Feminism and Modernity in the Middle East''. Lila Abu-Lughod. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998. 35\u201363. Print.</ref> Another important task was the \u201cforensic examination\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> of women. In this respect, hakimas operated in legal setting. Their examination was used as evidence in cases involving unnatural death, suspected premarital loss of virginity, or miscarriage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAlthough one task of the hakimas was overseeing childbirth, the majority of the population continued to use the dayas.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hakimas performed almost no deliveries and often were only called upon during difficult deliveries.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, dayas were required to have a certificate to perform deliveries, which could only be obtained from hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" /> They were also expected to report statistics on births to the hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA significant issue was recruitment of students. Egyptian culture at the time opposed the education of women.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the first students at the medical school were young slave girls.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slaves continued to be recruited through slave auctions as well as orphans from hospices.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the modest success of the school and its graduates, increasing enrolment remained a consistent problem, though the limit of 60 students was reached in 1846.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContemporary and modern historians have viewed the creation of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali.<ref name=\":2\" /> Khaled Fahmy argues against this view.<ref name=\":2\" /> Fahmy states that, because the reasons for the creation of the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals.<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Role in the Arabic literary renaissance ==\nIn the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational \"mission\" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].\n\nTo support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek \u2013 Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].\n\nIn 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the B\u016bl\u0101q Press under Muhammad 'Al\u012b of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129\u2013132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448|jstor=600448}}</ref>  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.\n\nAmong his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]\n\nThough Muhammad Ali's chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt</ref> The army often used the [[bastinado]] and the [[Flagellation|whip]] to control and punish the soldiers.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127</ref> Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref> A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142\u2013146.</ref> Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.</ref> This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.</ref>\nThe soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123</ref> In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124</ref>\n\n=== Arabian campaign ===\n{{Main|Wahhabi War}}\n\nMuhammad Ali's first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.\n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman\u2013Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal \u2018Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhile the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.<ref>Dodwell, 48.</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Sudan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)}}\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.<ref>Dodwell, 51.</ref> Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan.<ref>Emanuel Be\u0161ka, ''Muhammad Ali\u00b4s Conquest of Sudan (1820-1824)''. Asian and African Studies, 2019, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 30-56.</ref> Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.\n\n=== Greek rebellion ===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph S\u00e8ve (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Dodwell, 71.</ref> Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.\n\n=== War against the sultan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)}}\n\nIn compensation for his loss at Navarino, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.<ref>12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828</ref> But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.\n\nLike other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the W\u0101li since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The W\u0101li alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corv\u00e9e, and taxes, and he wanted them back.<ref>Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983</ref> (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])\n\nThe Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan's name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.<ref>Dodwell, 111.</ref> So long as Muhammad Ali's march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.<ref>Dodwell, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]].<ref>Cleveland, 72.</ref> Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].<ref name= Kupchan >{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}</ref> The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.<ref>Dodwell, 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n[[File:Interview with Mehemet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria, by David Roberts and Louis Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839), with [[Patrick Campbell (British Army officer, born 1779)|Patrick Campbell]] in the centre. After [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in [[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]]]\nSensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.<ref name=Vatikiotis66>Vatikiotis, 66.</ref> Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.\n\nOn 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Dodwell, 171.</ref> This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> With Muhammad Ali's intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.\n\nWhen Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.\n\nAt this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.<ref>Jarvis, 134.</ref> In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.\n\nAfter the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].<ref>Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\n[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nAfter 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.<ref>\"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...\", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the W\u0101li the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&nbsp;million francs (\u00a32,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres{{efn|A [[Kuru\u015f|piastre]] is forty ''[[Para (currency)|paras]]''. A ''para'' is the smallest Egyptian silver coin. In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.<ref>Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref> Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, \u0130brahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.\n\nA year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: \"[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?\"<ref>Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.</ref>\nAfter he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.\n\n[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]\n\nIt soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].\n\nBy this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].\n\nBut the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w\u0101li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.\n\nEyewitness British consul John Murray wrote:\n<blockquote>... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed \u2013 in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.\n\n<br>...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.<ref>F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]\n\nThe prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.<ref>The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad \u2018Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition'', trans.

He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and throughout his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous.

[[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, in the case of some important works,<ref>For example, Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad 'Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1931)</ref> the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the 1970s. Fuad's portrayal of Muhammad Ali as a [[Egyptian nationalism|nationalist]] and benevolent monarch therefore heavily influenced the historical debate. Later, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and his revolutionary republican regime promoted an alternative narrative which portrayed Muhammad Ali as the nationalist founder of modern Egypt but also an ambitious monarch with little regard for his people whose policies ultimately benefited himself and his dynasty at the expense of Egypt.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, ''Mehmed Ali: From Ottoman Governor to Ruler of Egypt'' (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2009)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt}}\n* [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty]]\n* [[Ottoman Egypt]]\n* [[Lists of rulers of Egypt]]\n* [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]\n* [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Ahmed, Jamal Mohammed.

The premise of the show was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts.\n\nThe daily syndicated show was produced by Ralph Edwards Productions (later Ralph Edwards/Stu Billett Productions), in association with and distributed by [[Metromedia|Metromedia Producers Corporation]] (1966\u20131978) and [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] (1987\u20131988). Current rights are owned by Ralph Edwards Productions and FremantleMedia.\n\n==Game play==\nOn the show, contestants received roughly two seconds to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question that no one would be able to answer correctly, or a bad joke) before \"Beulah the Buzzer\" sounded (in the rare occasion that the contestant answered the question correctly before Beulah was heard, the question inevitably had two or even three parts). If the contestant could not complete the \"Truth\" portion, there would be \"Consequences,\" usually a zany and embarrassing stunt.  Contestants' involvement in these stunts and the audience's reaction led Edwards to state about himself and his producers \"Aren't we devils?\" From the start, most contestants preferred to answer the question wrong to perform the stunt. Edwards said, \"Most of the American people are darned good sports.\"<ref>Id. at p193</ref>\n\nA popular segment on many episodes of was an emotional surprise for a contestant, such as being reunited with a long-lost relative or with an enlisted son or daughter returning from military duty overseas, particularly [[Vietnam]]. Sometimes, if a military member was based in [[California]], his spouse or parents were flown in for a reunion.\n\nDuring Barker's run as host, a side game, \"Barker's Box\", was played at the end of the show. Barker's Box had four drawers; three contained money, while a pop-up \"surprise\" was in the fourth. The contestant chose one drawer at a time and won the money in each. The game ended if the contestant found the surprise, while avoiding it awarded a bonus prize.\n\nBarker traditionally ended each episode with the phrase, \"Hoping all your consequences are happy ones.\" In one 1994 episode of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', he started to deliver that closing, but caught his mistake and covered it by saying \"hoping all your...prices are right!\", instead of the familiar \"Have your pets spayed or neutered\" line he was best known for using at the time.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n[[Image:Bob Barker dec 31 1956.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Bob Barker]]'s hosting debut on ''Truth or Consequences'']]\nRalph Edwards stated he got the idea for a new radio program from a favorite childhood parlor game, \"Forfeits\".<ref>\"Ralph Edwards,\" ''Current Biography 1943'', p192, 193.</ref>  The show premiered on NBC Radio on March 23, 1940, and was an instant hit with listeners.\n\n''Truth or Consequences'' was the first game show to air on broadcast television, airing as a one-time experiment on the first day of [[New York City|New York]] station [[WNBC|WNBT]]'s commercial program schedule on July 1, 1941. However, the series did not appear on TV again until 1950, when the medium had caught on commercially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Station WNBT Week of June 30th\u2013July 5th, 1941|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/1941_June_30_WNBT_Program.jpg|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe program originated as a prime time series, airing on [[CBS]] from Sept. 7, 1950, to May 31, 1951, hosted by Edwards. Three years later, it returned on [[NBC]] with Jack Bailey (of ''[[Queen for a Day]]'' fame) as host, this time running from May 18, 1954, to September 28, 1956. Only three months after its demise, NBC launched a new daytime version on Dec. 31 of that year, with radio personality Bob Barker at the helm. This run not only marked the start of a hugely successful television career for Barker, but also became the longest-running incarnation of ''Truth or Consequences'' yet, airing until September 24, 1965. During Barker's run, another prime time version was attempted, this one with actor Steve Dunne emceeing, which ran on NBC from December 13, 1957, to June 6, 1958.\n\nEdwards pioneered several technologies for recording live television programs. When ''Truth or Consequences'' established a permanent presence on TV in 1950, Edwards arranged to have it be recorded on 35mm film, using multiple cameras simultaneously\u2014the first TV program recorded before a live audience to do so.<ref>Ralph Edwards discusses the details of the process in a 1997 interview conducted by the Television Academy Foundation, http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/ralph-edwards .</ref> A similar process was then adapted by [[Desilu]] for ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' the following year. On January 22, 1957, the show, which was produced in Hollywood, became the first program to be broadcast in all time zones from a prerecorded [[videotape]]. This technology, which had only been introduced the previous year, had previously been used only for time-delayed broadcasts to the West Coast.<ref>\"Daily N.B.C. Show Will Be on Tape\", ''The New York Times'', Jan. 18, 1957, p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn 1966, ''Truth or Consequences'' became the first successful daily game show in first-run syndication (as opposed to reruns) to not air on a network, having ended its NBC run one year earlier. This version continued through 1975.\n\nIn the fall of 1977, a syndicated revival titled ''The New Truth or Consequences'' premiered. Because Bob Barker had already agreed to take over ''The Nighttime Price Is Right'' from [[Dennis James]], he was unavailable and [[Bob Hilton]] took over hosting. However, this version did not click in the ratings and was cancelled after a single season.\n\nA decade later, ''Truth or Consequences'' returned in syndication for the 1987-88 season, this time with actor [[Larry Anderson (actor)|Larry Anderson]] as host, assisted by [[Murray Langston]] (better known as \"The Unknown Comic\" of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' fame). This effort also failed to attract audiences and was gone after one season.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1949, [[Hot Springs, New Mexico]] agreed to host an episode of the radio program in exchange for changing its name to Truth or Consequences. It continues to use that name today, as well as hosting an annual ''Truth or Consequences'' festival, which series creator/producer Ralph Edwards participated in for many years.\n\nTruth or Consequences, New Mexico is a setting featured in a two-part episode of the British [[science fiction]] series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', \"[[The Zygon Invasion]]\" and \"[[The Zygon Inversion]]\", first broadcast in 2015. In the storyline, the origin of the town's name is discussed, with the game show referenced, and the concept of \"truth or consequences\" is a major plot element. \n\nReleased in 1950, the [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theatrical cartoon short ''[[The Ducksters]]'' features [[Porky Pig]] on a radio quiz show called ''Truth or AAAAHHH!!'', a somewhat macabre parody of ''Truth or Consequences'' (but with potentially lethal consequences) hosted by [[Daffy Duck]].\n\n==Possible reboot==\nIn October 2012, The Gurin Company<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/truth-consequences-treasure-hunt-back-1054227/|title=Exclusive: ''Oh Sit!'' Producer Brings Back Game Shows ''Truth or Consequences'', ''Treasure Hunt''|first=Michael|last=Schneider|date=4 October 2012|publisher=|via=TV Guide}}</ref> bought the license of the show from Ralph Edwards Productions to make an updated version along with the possible reboot of ''[[Treasure Hunt (U.S. game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'' and shopped for networks to buy it. Phil Gurin says that \"''Truth or Consequences'' is a great collection of game, stunt, hidden camera, reunions, surprises, strange talents and unique guests\" as \"It's just a really fun show. We're taking the original show and making it bigger\". In addition, he says that \"What's amazing, looking at older episodes, is that most people would answer the 'truth' questions incorrectly in order to subject themselves to the consequence.\" He also said that \"People want to perform the stunt, which always makes for good TV.

Current rights are owned by Ralph Edwards Productions and FremantleMedia.\n\n==Game play==\nOn the show, contestants received roughly two seconds to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question that no one would be able to answer correctly, or a bad joke) before \"Beulah the Buzzer\" sounded (in the rare occasion that the contestant answered the question correctly before Beulah was heard, the question inevitably had two or even three parts). If the contestant could not complete the \"Truth\" portion, there would be \"Consequences,\" usually a zany and embarrassing stunt.  Contestants' involvement in these stunts and the audience's reaction led Edwards to state about himself and his producers \"Aren't we devils?\" From the start, most contestants preferred to answer the question wrong to perform the stunt. Edwards said, \"Most of the American people are darned good sports.\"<ref>Id. at p193</ref>\n\nA popular segment on many episodes of was an emotional surprise for a contestant, such as being reunited with a long-lost relative or with an enlisted son or daughter returning from military duty overseas, particularly [[Vietnam]]. Sometimes, if a military member was based in [[California]], his spouse or parents were flown in for a reunion.\n\nDuring Barker's run as host, a side game, \"Barker's Box\", was played at the end of the show. Barker's Box had four drawers; three contained money, while a pop-up \"surprise\" was in the fourth. The contestant chose one drawer at a time and won the money in each. The game ended if the contestant found the surprise, while avoiding it awarded a bonus prize.\n\nBarker traditionally ended each episode with the phrase, \"Hoping all your consequences are happy ones.\" In one 1994 episode of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', he started to deliver that closing, but caught his mistake and covered it by saying \"hoping all your...prices are right!\", instead of the familiar \"Have your pets spayed or neutered\" line he was best known for using at the time.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n[[Image:Bob Barker dec 31 1956.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Bob Barker]]'s hosting debut on ''Truth or Consequences'']]\nRalph Edwards stated he got the idea for a new radio program from a favorite childhood parlor game, \"Forfeits\".<ref>\"Ralph Edwards,\" ''Current Biography 1943'', p192, 193.</ref>  The show premiered on NBC Radio on March 23, 1940, and was an instant hit with listeners.\n\n''Truth or Consequences'' was the first game show to air on broadcast television, airing as a one-time experiment on the first day of [[New York City|New York]] station [[WNBC|WNBT]]'s commercial program schedule on July 1, 1941. However, the series did not appear on TV again until 1950, when the medium had caught on commercially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Station WNBT Week of June 30th\u2013July 5th, 1941|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/1941_June_30_WNBT_Program.jpg|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1949, Hot Springs, N.M. agreed to host a radio episode in exchange for changing its name to Truth or Consequences. It continues to use that name today.\n\nThe program originated as a prime time series, airing on [[CBS]] from Sept. 7, 1950, to May 31, 1951, hosted by Edwards. Three years later, it returned on [[NBC]] with Jack Bailey (of ''[[Queen for a Day]]'' fame) as host, this time running from May 18, 1954, to September 28, 1956. Only three months after its demise, NBC launched a new daytime version on Dec. 31 of that year, with radio personality Bob Barker at the helm. This run not only marked the start of a hugely successful television career for Barker, but also became the longest-running incarnation of ''Truth or Consequences'' yet, airing until September 24, 1965. During Barker's run, another prime time version was attempted, this one with actor Steve Dunne emceeing, which ran on NBC from December 13, 1957, to June 6, 1958.\n\nEdwards pioneered several technologies for recording live television programs. When ''Truth or Consequences'' established a permanent presence on TV in 1950, Edwards arranged to have it be recorded on 35mm film, using multiple cameras simultaneously\u2014the first TV program recorded before a live audience to do so.<ref>Ralph Edwards discusses the details of the process in a 1997 interview conducted by the Television Academy Foundation, http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/ralph-edwards .</ref> A similar process was then adapted by [[Desilu]] for ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' the following year. On January 22, 1957, the show, which was produced in Hollywood, became the first program to be broadcast in all time zones from a prerecorded [[videotape]]. This technology, which had only been introduced the previous year, had previously been used only for time-delayed broadcasts to the West Coast.<ref>\"Daily N.B.C. Show Will Be on Tape\", ''The New York Times'', Jan. 18, 1957, p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn 1966, ''Truth or Consequences'' became the first successful daily game show in first-run syndication (as opposed to reruns) to not air on a network, having ended its NBC run one year earlier. This version continued through 1975.\n\nIn the fall of 1977, a syndicated revival titled ''The New Truth or Consequences'' premiered. Because Bob Barker had already agreed to take over ''The Nighttime Price Is Right'' from [[Dennis James]], he was unavailable and [[Bob Hilton]] took over hosting. However, this version did not click in ratings and was cancelled after a single season.\n\nA decade later, ''Truth or Consequences'' returned in syndication for the 1987-88 season, this time with actor [[Larry Anderson (actor)|Larry Anderson]] as host, assisted by [[Murray Langston]] (better known as \"The Unknown Comic\" of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' fame). This effort also failed to attract audiences and was gone after one season.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] is a setting featured in a two-part episode of the British [[science fiction]] series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', \"[[The Zygon Invasion]]\" and \"[[The Zygon Inversion]]\", first broadcast in 2015. In the storyline, the origin of the town's name is discussed, with the game show referenced, and the concept of \"truth or consequences\" is a major plot element. \n\nReleased in 1950, the [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theatrical cartoon short ''[[The Ducksters]]'' features [[Porky Pig]] on a radio quiz show called ''Truth or AAAAHHH!!'', a somewhat macabre parody of ''Truth or Consequences'' (but with potentially lethal consequences) hosted by [[Daffy Duck]].\n\n==Possible reboot==\nIn October 2012, The Gurin Company<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/truth-consequences-treasure-hunt-back-1054227/|title=Exclusive: ''Oh Sit!''

Phil Gurin says that \"''Truth or Consequences'' is a great collection of game, stunt, hidden camera, reunions, surprises, strange talents and unique guests\" as \"It's just a really fun show. We're taking the original show and making it bigger\". In addition, he says that \"What's amazing, looking at older episodes, is that most people would answer the 'truth' questions incorrectly in order to subject themselves to the consequence.\" He also said that \"People want to perform the stunt, which always makes for good TV. Add an unexpected reunion with a family member, or a surprise from someone in the past, and the show tugs at your heart strings\".\n\n==See also==\n*''[[People are Funny|People Are Funny]]''\n*''[[CBS Television Quiz]]'' ([[CBS]] Television, 1941\u20131942)\n*''[[Spelling Bee (game show)|Spelling Bee]]'' ([[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] game show, 1938)\n*[[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0143074|title=Truth or Consequences}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/TruthorConsequences Radio programs]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Truth Or Consequences}}\n[[Category:1940s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:1950s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:1941 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1950 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1965 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1966 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1978 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1987 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1950s American television series]]\n[[Category:1940s American game shows]]\n[[Category:1950s American game shows]]\n[[Category:1960s American game shows]]\n[[Category:1970s American game shows]]\n[[Category:1980s American game shows]]\n[[Category:Black-and-white American television programs]]\n[[Category:CBS original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series by Ralph Edwards Productions]]\n[[Category:Television series by Metromedia]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:NBC radio programs]]\n[[Category:Radio programs adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series based on radio programs]]\n", "name_user": "RadioChuck", "label": "safe", "comment": "Relocated mention of Hot Springs, NM name change here, added blurb on its annual ToC festival.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_or_Consequences"}

Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\".

[[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century.

Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT).

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]\n\n[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721;] {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.

Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K.

[[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]\nThe first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. [[Data mining]] can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.\n\n===Drones===\n\nArchaeologists around the world use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru, small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps \u2013 and in days and weeks instead of months and years.<ref name=peru>{{citation|author=Reuters in Lima |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins |title=Peru's archaeologists turn to drones to help protect and explore ancient ruins &#124; World news |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124451/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins|archivedate=25 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDrones costing as little as \u00a3650 have proven useful.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.<ref name=\"rapidcityjournal\"/>\n[[File:Poster of Hawraman conference.jpg|thumb|left|Poster of a conference on Archaeology of Hawraman region of Kurdistan in 2018]]\nTelevision programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience.

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]\n\n[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721;] {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.

The ''Doctrina'' was written in Spanish and two transcriptions of Tagalog; one in the ancient, then-current [[Baybayin]] script and the other in an early Spanish attempt at a [[Latin script|Latin]] orthography for the language.\n\n[[File:Vocabulario de la lengua tagala 1794.jpg|thumb|200px|''Vocabulario de la lengua tagala'', 1794.]]\n\nThroughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen. In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the \u201cArte y reglas de la Lengua Tagala\u201d (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" in Pila, Laguna.\n\nThe first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and Jos\u00e9 Hernandez.<ref>Juan Jos\u00e9 de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, Manila 2013, pg iv, Komision sa Wikang Filipino</ref> Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P.

The color-schemes represent the four dialect zones of the language: Northern, Central, Southern and [[Marinduque]]. While the majority of residents in [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] traditionally speak [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] as their first language, these provinces nonetheless have significant Tagalog minorities. In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]\n\nAt present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngay\u00f3n'' (now, today), ''sinig\u00e1ng'' (broth stew), ''gab\u00ed'' (night), ''matam\u00eds'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.\n* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bund\u00f3k'', ''dagat'', ''dingd\u00edng'', and ''isd\u00e2'' become ''bunr\u00f3k'', ''ragat'', ''ringr\u00edng'', and ''isr\u00e2'', e.g. \"sand\u00f3k sa dingd\u00edng\" becoming \"sanr\u00f3k sa ringr\u00edng\".\n* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in ka ba ng pat\u00edng?'' (\"Do you eat shark?\"), he would be understood as saying \"Has a shark eaten you?\" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.\n* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=2015 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Filipino language|Manila Tagalog]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Marinduque\u00f1o Tagalog\n! scope=\"col\" | English\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Susulat sin\u00e1 Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| M\u00e1s\u00falat da Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| \"Mar\u00eda and Esperanza will write to Juan.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mag-aaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| Gaaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| \"[He/She] will study in Manila.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maglut\u00f2 ka na.\n| Paglut\u00f2.\n| \"Cook now.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kainin mo iy\u00e1n.\n| Kaina yaan.\n| \"Eat it.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tinatawag tayo ni Tatay.\n| Inatawag ngan\u00ec kit\u00e1 ni Tatay.\n| \"Father is calling us.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\u00fatulungan ba kay\u00f3 ni Hilario?\n| Atulungan ga kamo ni Hilario?\n| \"Is Hilario going to help you?\"\n|}\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\n===Accents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\n[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangue\u00f1os as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more [[Linguistic conservatism|deep words]] and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents. Quezon's Tagalog has also has several unique words, and each town has a different tone, like in [[Sariaya]], [[Atimonan]] and [[Gumaca]].\n\nCavite accent specifically in the lowland part of the province were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga while in upland Cavite like in the municipalities of [[Alfonso, Cavite]], [[Magallanes, Cavite]] as well as [[Tagaytay City]] uses the accent comparable to the accent used in western Batangas due to its proximity.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents, notably in the municipality of [[Alaminos, Laguna]] and the City of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] has the accent comparable to the accent used in eastern Batangas while the accent used in the northern parts of Laguna such as [[Bi\u00f1an, Laguna]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna]] uses the accent comparable to Manila Tagalog.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n===Code-switching with English===\n{{main|Taglish}}\n\n''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\n{{Verse translation\n| Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?\n| We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?\n}}\n\nCity-dwellers are more likely to do this.\n\nThe practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nTagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally CrVC, where Cr only occurs in borrowed words such as ''trak'' \"truck\" or ''sombr\u00e9ro'' \"hat\".<ref name=ELL>{{ELL2|Tagalog}}</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nTagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs.<ref name=ELL/> Before appearing in the area north of the Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from central and northern Philippines, such as the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages, as well as Spanish words.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+caption | '''Table of the five general Tagalog vowel phonemes'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

Primary stress occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs at the end of a word.\n\nTagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress and/or the presence of a final glottal stop. In formal or academic settings, stress placement and the glottal stop are indicated by a [[diacritic]] (''tuld\u00edk'') above the final vowel.<ref>Himmelmann, Nikolaus (2005). \"Tagalog\" in K. Alexander Adelaar & Nikolaus Himmelmann (eds.)

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]\u2014or [[alphasyllabary]]\u2014called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 rather than \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La Espa\u00f1a Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La Espa\u00f1a'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name=\"k is for\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938\u2013967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The revolutionary society Kata\u00e1s-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng\u0303 mg\u0303\u00e1 Anak ng\u0303 Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name=\"k is for\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balar\u00edl\u00e0 ng Wikang Pambans\u00e2'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name=\"ebolusyon\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref> The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\n===Baybayin===\n{{Main|Baybayin}}\n\nTagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]</div>\n\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin A.svg|center|\u1700]] a || [[File:Baybayin E-I.svg|center|\u1701]] e/i || [[File:Baybayin O-U.svg|center|\u1702]] o/u\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ka.svg|center|\u1703]] ka || [[File:Baybayin Ga.svg|center|\u1704]] ga || [[File:Baybayin Nga.svg|center|\u1705]] nga\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ta.svg|center|\u1706]] ta || [[File:Baybayin Da.svg|center|\u1707]] da/ra || [[File:Baybayin Na.svg|center|\u1708]] na\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Pa.svg|center|\u1709]] pa || [[File:Baybayin Ba.svg|center|\u170a]] ba || [[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|center|\u170b]] ma\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ya.svg|center|\u170c]] ya || [[File:Baybayin La.svg|center|\u170e]] la || [[File:Baybayin Wa.svg|center|\u170f]] wa || [[File:Baybayin Sa.svg|center|\u1710]] sa || [[File:Baybayin Ha.svg|center|\u1711]] ha\n|}\n</div>\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ vowels\n!

(Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[na\u014b]}} and ''mang\u00e1'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. \n* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadul\u00e1s.''\u2014When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.\n* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''\u2014He woke up <u>early</u>.\n* ''Gumal\u00edng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''\u2014Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.\n\nIn the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is \"greatly\" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').\n\nThe longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:\n*''Naghint\u00e1y sila '''nang''' naghint\u00e1y.''\u2014They kept on waiting\" (a closer calque: \"They were waiting and waiting.\")\n\n===''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2''===\nThe words ''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"''oo''\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"P\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"H\u00f4\" and \"oh\u00f2\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"p\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n*Example: \"''Pakitapon naman '''p\u00f4/ho''' yung basura.''\" (\"Please throw away the trash.\")\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n*Ex: \"''Gut\u00f3m ka na ba?\" \"'''Op\u00f2/Oh\u00f2'''''\". (\"Are you hungry yet?\" \"Yes.\")\n\n''P\u00f4/H\u00f4'' may also be used in negation.\n*Ex: \"''Hindi ko '''p\u00f4/h\u00f4''' alam 'yan.''\" (\"I don't know that.\")\n\n==Vocabulary and borrowed words==\n{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, the [[Silk Road]], the [[Tang Dynasty]], the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], the [[Spice Route]] and the [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Other examples of Tagalog words used in English\n! scope=\"col \" | Example\n! scope=\"col \" | Definition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[boondocks]]\n| meaning \"rural\" or \"back country,\" was imported by American soldiers stationed in the Philippines following the Spanish\u2013American War as a mispronounced version of the Tagalog ''bundok'', which means \"mountain.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | cogon\n| a type of grass, used for thatching.

The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> (\"the Bible\") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version\n* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]\n* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version\n* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Lord's Prayer===\nIn Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Am\u00e1 Namin'' (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\n{{Poemquote\n| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;\n| text=\nAm\u00e1 namin, sumasalangit Ka,\nSambah\u00edn ang ngalan Mo.\nMapasaamin ang kahari\u00e1n Mo.\nSund\u00edn ang lo\u00f3b Mo,\nDito sa lup\u00e0, gaya nang sa langit.\nBigy\u00e1n Mo kam\u00ed ngay\u00f3n ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,\nAt patawarin Mo kam\u00ed sa aming mga sal\u00e2,\nPara nang pagp\u00e1patawad namin,\nSa nagkakasal\u00e0 sa amin;\nAt huw\u00e1g Mo kam\u00edng ipahintulot sa tuks\u00f3,\nAt iady\u00e2 Mo kam\u00ed sa lah\u00e1t ng masam\u00e2.\n[Sapagk\u00e1t sa Iny\u00f3 ang kahari\u00e1n, at ang kapangyarihan,\nAt ang kaluw\u00e1lhatian, ngay\u00f3n, at magpakailanman.]\nAmen.\n}}\n\n===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\nThis is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''P\u00e1ngkalahat\u00e1ng Pagpapahayag ng Karapat\u00e1ng Pantao'')\n\n{{Verse translation\n| lang=tl\n| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may lay\u00e0 at magkakapant\u00e1y ang tagl\u00e1y na dang\u00e1l at karapat\u00e1n.

The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number \"seven\", it can be translated into Tagalog as \"''pito''\" or \"''siyete''\" (Spanish: ''siete'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Cardinal\n! scope=\"col\" | Spanish loanword<br />(Original Spanish)\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordinal\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 0\n| sero / wal\u00e2 (lit. \"null\") / aw\u00e1n\n| sero (cero)\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| is\u00e1\n| uno (uno)\n| una\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| dalaw\u00e1 [dalaua]\n| dos (dos)\n| pangalaw\u00e1 / ikalaw\u00e1 (informally, ikadalaw\u00e1)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| tatl\u00f3\n| tres (tres)\n| pangatl\u00f3 / ikatl\u00f3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| apat\n| kuwatro (cuatro)\n| pang-apat / ikaapat (\"ika\" and the number-word are never hyphenated.

The ''Doctrina'' was written in Spanish and two transcriptions of Tagalog; one in the ancient, then-current [[Baybayin]] script and the other in an early Spanish attempt at a [[Latin script|Latin]] orthography for the language.\n\n[[File:Vocabulario de la lengua tagala 1794.jpg|thumb|200px|''Vocabulario de la lengua tagala'', 1794.]]\n\nThroughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen. In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the \u201cArte y reglas de la Lengua Tagala\u201d (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" in Pila, Laguna.\n\nThe first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and Jos\u00e9 Hernandez.<ref>Juan Jos\u00e9 de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, Manila 2013, pg iv, Komision sa Wikang Filipino</ref> Further  compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P.

In most [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] and [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] languages, this sound merged with {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|[o]}}. In Tagalog, it has merged with {{IPA|/i/}}.

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*\u014bajan}} (name) and {{IPA|*haj\u0259k}} (kiss) became Tagalog ''ngalan'' and ''hal\u00edk''.\n\nProto-Philippine {{IPA|*R}} merged with {{IPA|/\u0261/}}. {{IPA|*tubiR}} (water) and {{IPA|*zuRu\u0294}} (blood) became Tagalog ''tubig'' and ''dug\u00f4''.\n\n===Official status===\n{{Main|Filipino language}}\n\nTagalog was declared the official language by the first revolutionary constitution in the Philippines, the [[wikisource:Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1897)#ARTICLE VIII: OFFICIAL LANGUAGE|Constitution of Biak-na-Bato]] in 1897.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&page=1&epage=1 |title=1897 Constitution of Biak-na-Bato, Article VIII |accessdate=2008-01-16 |publisher=Filipiniana.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228152829/http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&page=1&epage=1 |archivedate=2009-02-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, the Philippine constitution designated English and Spanish as official languages, but mandated the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1935constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1935 Philippine Constitution, Article XIV, Section 3 |accessdate = 2007-12-20 |publisher = Chanrobles Law Library}}</ref> After study and deliberation, the National Language Institute, a committee composed of seven members who represented various regions in the Philippines, chose Tagalog as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines.<ref name=MLQspeech>{{Citation|url=http://www.quezon.ph/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/mlq-speech-national-language-1.pdf |title=Quezon's speech proclaiming Tagalog the basis of the National Language |author=Manuel L.

However, more than two decades after the institution of the \"universalist\" approach, there seems to be little if any difference between Tagalog and Filipino.\n\nMany of the older generation in the Philippines feel that the replacement of English by Tagalog in the popular visual media has had dire economic effects regarding the competitiveness of the Philippines in trade and overseas remittances.<ref>{{cite news |title=The cost of being tongue-tied in the colonisers' tongue |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2009/06/04/e-for-english |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=4 June 2009 |quote=ONCE it claimed to have more English speakers than all but two other countries, and it has exported millions of them.

The color-schemes represent the four dialect zones of the language: Northern, Central, Southern and [[Marinduque]]. While the majority of residents in [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] traditionally speak [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] as their first language, these provinces nonetheless have significant Tagalog minorities. In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]\n\nAt present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngay\u00f3n'' (now, today), ''sinig\u00e1ng'' (broth stew), ''gab\u00ed'' (night), ''matam\u00eds'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.\n* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bund\u00f3k'', ''dagat'', ''dingd\u00edng'', and ''isd\u00e2'' become ''bunr\u00f3k'', ''ragat'', ''ringr\u00edng'', and ''isr\u00e2'', e.g. \"sand\u00f3k sa dingd\u00edng\" becoming \"sanr\u00f3k sa ringr\u00edng\".\n* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in ka ba ng pat\u00edng?'' (\"Do you eat shark?\"), he would be understood as saying \"Has a shark eaten you?\" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.\n* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=2015 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of  Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Filipino language| Manila Tagalog]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Marinduque\u00f1o Tagalog\n! scope=\"col\" | English\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Susulat sin\u00e1 Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| M\u00e1s\u00falat da Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| \"Mar\u00eda and Esperanza will write to Juan.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mag-aaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| Gaaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| \"[He/She] will study in Manila.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maglut\u00f2 ka na.\n| Paglut\u00f2.\n| \"Cook now.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kainin mo iy\u00e1n.\n| Kaina yaan.\n| \"Eat it.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tinatawag tayo ni Tatay.\n| Inatawag ngan\u00ec kit\u00e1 ni Tatay.\n| \"Father is calling us.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\u00fatulungan ba kay\u00f3 ni Hilario?\n| Atulungan ga kamo ni Hilario?\n| \"Is Hilario going to help you?\"\n|}\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\n===Accents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\n[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangue\u00f1os as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more [[Linguistic conservatism|deep words]] and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents. Quezon's Tagalog has also has several unique words, and each town has a different tone, like in [[Sariaya]], [[Atimonan]] and [[Gumaca]].\n\nCavite accent specifically in the lowland part of the province were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga while in upland Cavite like in the municipalities of [[Alfonso, Cavite]], [[Magallanes, Cavite]] as well as [[Tagaytay City]] uses the accent comparable to the accent used in western Batangas due to its proximity.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents, notably in the municipality of [[Alaminos, Laguna]] and the City of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] has the accent comparable to the accent used in eastern Batangas while the accent used in the northern parts of Laguna such as [[Bi\u00f1an, Laguna]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna]] uses the accent comparable to Manila Tagalog.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n===Code-switching with English===\n{{main|Taglish}}\n\n''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\n{{Verse translation\n| Magshoshopping kami sa mall.

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]\u2014or [[alphasyllabary]]\u2014called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 rather than \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La Espa\u00f1a Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La Espa\u00f1a'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name=\"k is for\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938\u2013967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The revolutionary society Kata\u00e1s-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng\u0303 mg\u0303\u00e1 Anak ng\u0303 Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name=\"k is for\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balar\u00edl\u00e0 ng Wikang Pambans\u00e2'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name=\"ebolusyon\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref>  The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\n===Baybayin===\n{{Main|Baybayin}}\n\nTagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]</div>\n\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin A.svg|center|\u1700]] a || [[File:Baybayin E-I.svg|center|\u1701]] e/i || [[File:Baybayin O-U.svg|center|\u1702]] o/u\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ka.svg|center|\u1703]] ka || [[File:Baybayin Ga.svg|center|\u1704]] ga || [[File:Baybayin Nga.svg|center|\u1705]] nga\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ta.svg|center|\u1706]] ta || [[File:Baybayin Da.svg|center|\u1707]] da/ra || [[File:Baybayin Na.svg|center|\u1708]] na\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Pa.svg|center|\u1709]] pa || [[File:Baybayin Ba.svg|center|\u170a]] ba || [[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|center|\u170b]] ma\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ya.svg|center|\u170c]] ya || [[File:Baybayin La.svg|center|\u170e]] la || [[File:Baybayin Wa.svg|center|\u170f]] wa || [[File:Baybayin Sa.svg|center|\u1710]] sa || [[File:Baybayin Ha.svg|center|\u1711]] ha\n|}\n</div>\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ vowels\n!

(Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[na\u014b]}} and ''mang\u00e1'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. \n* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadul\u00e1s.''\u2014When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.\n* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''\u2014He woke up <u>early</u>.\n* ''Gumal\u00edng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''\u2014Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.\n\nIn the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is \"greatly\" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').\n\nThe longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:\n*''Naghint\u00e1y sila '''nang''' naghint\u00e1y.''\u2014They kept on waiting\" (a closer calque: \"They were waiting and waiting.\")\n\n===''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2''===\nThe words ''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"''oo''\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"P\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"H\u00f4\" and \"oh\u00f2\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"p\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n*Example: \"''Pakitapon naman '''p\u00f4/ho''' yung basura.''\" (\"Please throw away the trash.\")\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n*Ex: \"''Gut\u00f3m ka na ba?\" \"'''Op\u00f2/Oh\u00f2'''''\". (\"Are you hungry yet?\" \"Yes.\")\n\n''P\u00f4/H\u00f4'' may also be used in negation.\n*Ex: \"''Hindi ko '''p\u00f4/h\u00f4''' alam 'yan.''\" (\"I don't know that.\")\n\n==Vocabulary and borrowed words==\n{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, the [[Silk Road]], the [[Tang Dynasty]], the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], the [[Spice Route]] and the [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Other examples of Tagalog words used in English\n! scope=\"col \" | Example\n! scope=\"col \" | Definition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[boondocks]]\n| meaning \"rural\" or \"back country,\" was imported by American soldiers stationed in the Philippines following the Spanish\u2013American War as a mispronounced version of the Tagalog ''bundok'', which means \"mountain.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | cogon\n| a type of grass, used for thatching.

The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> (\"the Bible\") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n\n* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version\n* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]\n* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version\n* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Lord's Prayer===\nIn Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Am\u00e1 Namin'' (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\n{{Poemquote\n| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;\n| text=\nAm\u00e1 namin, sumasalangit Ka,\nSambah\u00edn ang ngalan Mo.\nMapasaamin ang kahari\u00e1n Mo.\nSund\u00edn ang lo\u00f3b Mo,\nDito sa lup\u00e0, gaya nang sa langit.\nBigy\u00e1n Mo kam\u00ed ngay\u00f3n ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,\nAt patawarin Mo kam\u00ed sa aming mga sal\u00e2,\nPara nang pagp\u00e1patawad namin,\nSa nagkakasal\u00e0 sa amin;\nAt huw\u00e1g Mo kam\u00edng ipahintulot sa tuks\u00f3,\nAt iady\u00e2 Mo kam\u00ed sa lah\u00e1t ng masam\u00e2.\n[Sapagk\u00e1t sa Iny\u00f3 ang kahari\u00e1n, at ang kapangyarihan,\nAt ang kaluw\u00e1lhatian, ngay\u00f3n, at magpakailanman.]\nAmen.\n}}\n\n===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\nThis is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''P\u00e1ngkalahat\u00e1ng Pagpapahayag ng Karapat\u00e1ng Pantao'')\n\n{{Verse translation\n| lang=tl\n| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may lay\u00e0 at magkakapant\u00e1y ang tagl\u00e1y na dang\u00e1l at karapat\u00e1n.

The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number \"seven\", it can be translated into Tagalog as \"''pito''\" or \"''siyete''\" (Spanish: ''siete'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Cardinal\n! scope=\"col\" | Spanish loanword<br />(Original Spanish)\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordinal\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 0\n| sero / wal\u00e2 (lit. \"null\") / aw\u00e1n\n| sero (cero)\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| is\u00e1\n| uno (uno)\n| una\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| dalaw\u00e1 [dalaua]\n| dos (dos)\n| pangalaw\u00e1 / ikalaw\u00e1 (informally, ikadalaw\u00e1)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| tatl\u00f3\n| tres (tres)\n| pangatl\u00f3 / ikatl\u00f3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| apat\n| kuwatro (cuatro)\n| pang-apat / ikaapat (\"ika\" and the number-word are never hyphenated.

It refers to the two styles of courting by Filipino boys: one is the traditional, protracted, restrained manner favored by older generations, which often featured [[Harana (serenade)|serenades]] and manual labor for the girl's family; the other is upfront seduction, which may lead to a slap on the face or a pregnancy out of wedlock.

region along the [[South China|southern coastal regions]] of [[China]] and beyond, otherwise known as the '[[Four Seas|South Sea]]' or [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=bertil94/> The term came into common usage in self-reference to the large [[Han Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] migrant population in Southeast Asia, and is contrasted with ''Xiyang'' ({{zh|c=\u897f\u6d0b|p=x\u012b y\u00e1ng|l=Western Ocean}}), which refers to the [[Western world]], ''Dongyang'' ({{zh|s=\u4e1c\u6d0b|t=\u6771\u6d0b|p=d\u014dng y\u00e1ng|l=Eastern Ocean}}), which refers to [[Japan]], and ''Beiyang'' ({{zh|c=\u5317\u6d0b|p=b\u011bi y\u00e1ng|l=Northern Ocean}}), which refers to [[Russia]]. The Chinese press regularly uses the term to refer to the region stretching from [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]] to [[Singapore]] (north to south) and from [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]] to [[Vietnam]] (west to east); in addition, the term also refers to [[Brunei]], [[East Malaysia]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] in the region it encompasses.<ref name=bertil94>{{cite journal|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=Enter the Dragon|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=22 December 1994|volume=23}}</ref>\n\nThe alternative term, \"[[Golden Chersonese|Great Golden Peninsula]]\", came into common usage due to the large number of Chinese [[immigration|migrants]] \u2013 attempting to escape the reach of the oppressive [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Emperors \u2013 it received.<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\">{{cite book|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=Blood Brothers: Crime, Business and Politics in Asia|date=2002|publisher=Silkworm Books|page=221}}</ref>  The Chinese, especially those from the southeastern seaboard, also ventured to the region to engage in [[trade]]. The Nanyang was extremely important in the trading business and one of China\u2019s main trading partners in early years; it encompassed three main trading routes: one through [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]], one through [[Vietnam]] and lastly one through [[Laos]].<ref name=\"bertil94\"/>\n\n== Historical significance ==\nWaves of Chinese [[emigration]] from mainland China, also referred to as the [[Chinese diaspora]], to The Great Golden Peninsula and other regions have occurred several times through the course of history. The first wave of emigration came as a result of the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1644,<ref name=\"at\">{{cite web|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=A new breed of migrants fans out|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/ID17Ad04.html|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> the ruling dynasty in [[China]] that followed the collapse of the [[Yuan dynasty]] and ruled for 276 years. The migrants opposed the Manchu seizure of power in [[Beijing]] and migrated to establish overseas Chinese communities throughout the Nanyang region. This led to Chinese control of large parts of the region\u2019s economy and means of production.<ref name=\"at\"/>\n\nThe second wave started as a form of escaping the oppressive control exerted by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Emperors<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\"/> of the [[Qing dynasty]], the last imperial dynasty of [[China]] ruling from 1644 to 1911.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qing Dynasty (1644-1911 AD)|url=http://www.china-tour.cn/Chinese-History/Qing-Dynasty.htm|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> After the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and alternative upheavals that resulted in the disintegration of China, warlords ruptured the country into lawless fiefdoms, leading to an expansion of the Chinese communities in the Nanyang.<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\"/>\n\nThe [[Mekong River]], gathering its strength in the Yunnan province and flowing south into the Nanyang nations of Burma, [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]] before spilling into the [[South China Sea]], was an extremely important facilitator of the Chinese Diaspora. It became known, not as a nourishing and life-giving river, but as the leading channel out of China for illegal migrants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=River of Dreams: Chinese Emigrants Pour Down the Mekong|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=1994|volume=23}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, the third wave of migrants to the Nanyang \u2013 coming from all over China \u2013 has led to, arguably, more profound economic and social impacts than waves in the past. Better overland routes and air travel,<ref name=\"at\"/> along with the more relaxed Chinese emigration regulations of 1979 and China\u2019s economic reform and opening up of its economy in 1980, have facilitated the process of migration and led the Chinese into a search for business opportunities in the Great Golden Peninsula.<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\"/>\n\n== Economic development of the Nanyang ==\nThe Great Golden Peninsula has benefitted greatly from Chinese immigration. Economic opportunity, commerce in particular, brought the Chinese to the Nanyang, and involvement in commercial activities is a common characteristic amongst Chinese minorities in the region.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\">{{cite book|last=Somers Heidhues|first=Mary F.|title=Southeast Asia's Chinese Minorities|date=1974|publisher=Longman Australia Pty Limited}}</ref> These Chinese family businesses and the Chinese population of the Nanyang can be characterized as the driving force behind economic growth and capitalism of the region.<ref name=\"Kirkbride 1992\">{{cite journal|last=Kirkbride|first=Paul S|author2=Sara F Y Tang|title=Management Development in the Nanyang Chinese Societies of South-East Asia|journal=The Journal of Management Development|date=1992|volume=11|series=2}}</ref>\n\nSince the period after 1850, the Chinese have come to dominate small business in the major cities of the Nanyang. They tended not only to own the shops, but hire mostly Chinese workers, increasing the scope and power of the Chinese influence.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\"/> These business are distinguished by high level of centralization, most of the decision-making relies on the owner-manager; absence of bureaucratic regulation, yielding a fluid organizational structure; an autocratic and paternalistic leadership style; existence of preferential treatment combined with extensive family ties of obligation of duty; and finally, a customized network of external links. These features set them apart from other businesses in the Nanyang and allowed them to thrive due to the entrepreneurial talent they demonstrated.<ref name=\"Kirkbride 1992\"/>\n\nBecause the business industry for the Nanyang-Chinese seemed extremely prosperous, most of the Chinese immigrants strove to acquaint themselves with the shopkeepers and attempted to learn and eventually master trade in the hopes that they too would eventually gain entry to business in the Nanyang. This allowed for the continuation of business-creation by the Chinese arriving in the region.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\"/>\n\nThe overseas Chinese of the Great Golden Peninsula play extremely significant roles in the region; in particular, involved with trade and commerce, mining and commercial agriculture.<ref name=\"Ooi 2004 936\">{{cite book|last=Ooi|first=Keat Gin|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|date=2004|page=936}}</ref>  One of the main benefits the Chinese merchants brought to the Nanyang region is a more prominent relationship with the United States and other Pacific countries due to the strong link these merchants foster with foreign countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wu|first=Yuan-li|title=Economic Development in Southeast Asia: The Chinese Dimension}}</ref> The Nanyang Chinese continue to be vibrant elements in their newfound homes.\n\nDespite [[Sinophobia#South Asia|pogroms]] and [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|discrimination against the Chinese]] in the Nanyang, especially where they constituted the minorities, the region still remains economically attractive to them. Pockets of settled Chinese communities continue to testify to the attractiveness of the Great Golden Peninsula.<ref name=\"Ooi 2004 936\"/>\n\nAlthough China has positive impacts in the Nanyang region, in more recent years (since the early 1980s), China\u2019s continuous success with its open-door policy and export-oriented development strategy has started to cast a shadow on economies of the Great Golden Peninsula that must compete with China in attracting [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) and in manufactured products to the same markets.<ref>{{cite book|title=China-Asean Relations: Economic and Legal Dimensions|date=2006|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.|location=Singapore|author=John Wong|author2=Zou Keyuan |author3=Zeng Huaqun }}</ref>\n\n== Trade routes ==\n[[File:CIA World Factbook map of Singapore (English).png|thumbnail|right|Singapore - base for Chinese trade in Nanyang]]\nChina's chief interest in the region of the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wong|first=John|title=The political economy of China's changing relations with Southeast Asia|date=1984|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan \u2013 where the [[Mekong River]], previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control \u2013 the region was the [[Campaign at the China\u2013Burma border|last stronghold of anti-communist forces]]. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.<ref name=\"bertil94\"/>\n\nAnother main avenue for Chinese trade with the Great Golden Peninsula is the South China Sea; it was the main route for trade in commodities and ideas, and even named the second [[Silk Route]]. Trade flows between China and the Nanyang were characterized by exports of manufactured or processed goods from China and exports of raw materials and food \u2013 particularly rice \u2013 from the Nanyang.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Robert B.|title=Tigers, Rice, Silk, and Silt: Environment and Economy in Late Imperial South China|page=6}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Singapore developed into the center of trade between the two regions; it became the base for Chinese activity in the Nanyang. Singapore was not only a main source of capital for overseas Chinese in the Nanyang but it also handled Chinese human cargo by \u2018sorting\u2019 it according to their skills and sturdiness.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\"/>\n\n== Social impact in the Nanyang ==\nThe Nanyang region has been in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] of influence for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Shmidheise 2008\">{{cite book|last=Shmidheise|first=Klaus|title=The Plaid Avenger's World|date=2008|location=United States of America}}</ref> Therefore, the rise in the role and influence of the ethnic Chinese is extremely important for the understanding of the region.<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\">{{cite book|title=ASEAN-China Relations: Realities and Prospects|date=2005|publisher=ISEAS Publications|location=Singapore|author=Saw Swee-Hock|author2=Sheng Lijun |author3=Chin Kin Wah }}</ref> The [[Chinese philosophy]], [[religion]], [[political philosophies]], governmental standards and overall way of life have been transferred to the Great Golden Peninsula.<ref name=\"Shmidheise 2008\"/>\n\nOne of the many examples of China's influence over the region is the Chinese [[Lunar New Year]], commonly referred to as \u201c[[Chinese New Year]]\u201d. It is celebrated and is an official public holiday in many countries of the Nanyang region (Vietnam, [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]]).<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\"/> Another prominent example is the original roots of the people in the region; a significant portion of the population of the Nanyang region originated in China, especially when it comes to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore.<ref name=\"Shmidheise 2008\"/>\n\nMore specifically, Chinese influence in Thailand is seen in a rise in [[Thai Chinese|Thai-Chinese]] power, not only in commerce and business but also in politics, bureaucracy and intelligentsia. In Indonesia, some news bulletins are in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], whilst in Singapore, one of the [[Languages of Singapore|four official languages]] is Mandarin. Vietnam has been following the 'China model' politically and economically; like in China, Vietnamese from overseas have led and been the most significant contributors of the economic recovery of the country. Malaysia experiences Chinese cultural influence through Chinese tycoons; they play a prominent role in leading the economic boom and inspire reforms to Malaysia\u2019s [[Malay supremacy]] policy.<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\"/>\n\nThe anti-Chinese sentiment of the Nanyang has subsided in recent years as Chinese influence results in prosperous rather than communist results. This has generated amongst many Nanyang-Chinese the will to rediscover their cultural identity in line with the emerging China of the north. One of the impacts of this rediscovery in the Nanyang region, is a boom in Mandarin classes.<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Golden Chersonese]], another gold-related name for

region along the [[South China|southern coastal regions]] of [[China]] and beyond, otherwise known as the '[[Four Seas|South Sea]]' or [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=bertil94/> The term came into common usage in self-reference to the large [[Han Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] migrant population in Southeast Asia, and is contrasted with ''Xiyang'' ({{zh|c=\u897f\u6d0b|p=x\u012b y\u00e1ng|l=Western Ocean}}), which refers to the [[Western world]], and ''Dongyang'' ({{zh|s=\u4e1c\u6d0b|t=\u6771\u6d0b|p=d\u014dng y\u00e1ng|l=Eastern Ocean}}), which refers to [[Japan]]. The Chinese press regularly uses the term to refer to the region stretching from [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]] to [[Singapore]] (north to south) and from [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]] to [[Vietnam]] (west to east); in addition, the term also refers to [[Brunei]], [[East Malaysia]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] in the region it encompasses.<ref name=bertil94>{{cite journal|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=Enter the Dragon|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=22 December 1994|volume=23}}</ref>\n\nThe alternative term, \"[[Golden Chersonese|Great Golden Peninsula]]\", came into common usage due to the large number of Chinese [[immigration|migrants]] \u2013 attempting to escape the reach of the oppressive [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Emperors \u2013 it received.<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\">{{cite book|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=Blood Brothers: Crime, Business and Politics in Asia|date=2002|publisher=Silkworm Books|page=221}}</ref>  The Chinese, especially those from the southeastern seaboard, also ventured to the region to engage in [[trade]]. The Nanyang was extremely important in the trading business and one of China\u2019s main trading partners in early years; it encompassed three main trading routes: one through [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]], one through [[Vietnam]] and lastly one through [[Laos]].<ref name=\"bertil94\"/>\n\n== Historical significance ==\nWaves of Chinese [[emigration]] from mainland China, also referred to as the [[Chinese diaspora]], to The Great Golden Peninsula and other regions have occurred several times through the course of history. The first wave of emigration came as a result of the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1644,<ref name=\"at\">{{cite web|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=A new breed of migrants fans out|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/ID17Ad04.html|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> the ruling dynasty in [[China]] that followed the collapse of the [[Yuan dynasty]] and ruled for 276 years. The migrants opposed the Manchu seizure of power in [[Beijing]] and migrated to establish overseas Chinese communities throughout the Nanyang region. This led to Chinese control of large parts of the region\u2019s economy and means of production.<ref name=\"at\"/>\n\nThe second wave started as a form of escaping the oppressive control exerted by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Emperors<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\"/> of the [[Qing dynasty]], the last imperial dynasty of [[China]] ruling from 1644 to 1911.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qing Dynasty (1644-1911 AD)|url=http://www.china-tour.cn/Chinese-History/Qing-Dynasty.htm|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> After the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and alternative upheavals that resulted in the disintegration of China, warlords ruptured the country into lawless fiefdoms, leading to an expansion of the Chinese communities in the Nanyang.<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\"/>\n\nThe [[Mekong River]], gathering its strength in the Yunnan province and flowing south into the Nanyang nations of Burma, [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]] before spilling into the [[South China Sea]], was an extremely important facilitator of the Chinese Diaspora. It became known, not as a nourishing and life-giving river, but as the leading channel out of China for illegal migrants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|title=River of Dreams: Chinese Emigrants Pour Down the Mekong|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=1994|volume=23}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, the third wave of migrants to the Nanyang \u2013 coming from all over China \u2013 has led to, arguably, more profound economic and social impacts than waves in the past. Better overland routes and air travel,<ref name=\"at\"/> along with the more relaxed Chinese emigration regulations of 1979 and China\u2019s economic reform and opening up of its economy in 1980, have facilitated the process of migration and led the Chinese into a search for business opportunities in the Great Golden Peninsula.<ref name=\"Lintner 2002 221\"/>\n\n== Economic development of the Nanyang ==\nThe Great Golden Peninsula has benefitted greatly from Chinese immigration. Economic opportunity, commerce in particular, brought the Chinese to the Nanyang, and involvement in commercial activities is a common characteristic amongst Chinese minorities in the region.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\">{{cite book|last=Somers Heidhues|first=Mary F.|title=Southeast Asia's Chinese Minorities|date=1974|publisher=Longman Australia Pty Limited}}</ref> These Chinese family businesses and the Chinese population of the Nanyang can be characterized as the driving force behind economic growth and capitalism of the region.<ref name=\"Kirkbride 1992\">{{cite journal|last=Kirkbride|first=Paul S|author2=Sara F Y Tang|title=Management Development in the Nanyang Chinese Societies of South-East Asia|journal=The Journal of Management Development|date=1992|volume=11|series=2}}</ref>\n\nSince the period after 1850, the Chinese have come to dominate small business in the major cities of the Nanyang. They tended not only to own the shops, but hire mostly Chinese workers, increasing the scope and power of the Chinese influence.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\"/> These business are distinguished by high level of centralization, most of the decision-making relies on the owner-manager; absence of bureaucratic regulation, yielding a fluid organizational structure; an autocratic and paternalistic leadership style; existence of preferential treatment combined with extensive family ties of obligation of duty; and finally, a customized network of external links. These features set them apart from other businesses in the Nanyang and allowed them to thrive due to the entrepreneurial talent they demonstrated.<ref name=\"Kirkbride 1992\"/>\n\nBecause the business industry for the Nanyang-Chinese seemed extremely prosperous, most of the Chinese immigrants strove to acquaint themselves with the shopkeepers and attempted to learn and eventually master trade in the hopes that they too would eventually gain entry to business in the Nanyang. This allowed for the continuation of business-creation by the Chinese arriving in the region.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\"/>\n\nThe overseas Chinese of the Great Golden Peninsula play extremely significant roles in the region; in particular, involved with trade and commerce, mining and commercial agriculture.<ref name=\"Ooi 2004 936\">{{cite book|last=Ooi|first=Keat Gin|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|date=2004|page=936}}</ref>  One of the main benefits the Chinese merchants brought to the Nanyang region is a more prominent relationship with the United States and other Pacific countries due to the strong link these merchants foster with foreign countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wu|first=Yuan-li|title=Economic Development in Southeast Asia: The Chinese Dimension}}</ref> The Nanyang Chinese continue to be vibrant elements in their newfound homes.\n\nDespite [[Sinophobia#South Asia|pogroms]] and [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|discrimination against the Chinese]] in the Nanyang, especially where they constituted the minorities, the region still remains economically attractive to them. Pockets of settled Chinese communities continue to testify to the attractiveness of the Great Golden Peninsula.<ref name=\"Ooi 2004 936\"/>\n\nAlthough China has positive impacts in the Nanyang region, in more recent years (since the early 1980s), China\u2019s continuous success with its open-door policy and export-oriented development strategy has started to cast a shadow on economies of the Great Golden Peninsula that must compete with China in attracting [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) and in manufactured products to the same markets.<ref>{{cite book|title=China-Asean Relations: Economic and Legal Dimensions|date=2006|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.|location=Singapore|author=John Wong|author2=Zou Keyuan |author3=Zeng Huaqun }}</ref>\n\n== Trade routes ==\n[[File:CIA World Factbook map of Singapore (English).png|thumbnail|right|Singapore - base for Chinese trade in Nanyang]]\nChina's chief interest in the region of the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wong|first=John|title=The political economy of China's changing relations with Southeast Asia|date=1984|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan \u2013 where the [[Mekong River]], previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control \u2013 the region was the [[Campaign at the China\u2013Burma border|last stronghold of anti-communist forces]]. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.<ref name=\"bertil94\"/>\n\nAnother main avenue for Chinese trade with the Great Golden Peninsula is the South China Sea; it was the main route for trade in commodities and ideas, and even named the second [[Silk Route]]. Trade flows between China and the Nanyang were characterized by exports of manufactured or processed goods from China and exports of raw materials and food \u2013 particularly rice \u2013 from the Nanyang.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Robert B.|title=Tigers, Rice, Silk, and Silt: Environment and Economy in Late Imperial South China|page=6}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Singapore developed into the center of trade between the two regions; it became the base for Chinese activity in the Nanyang. Singapore was not only a main source of capital for overseas Chinese in the Nanyang but it also handled Chinese human cargo by \u2018sorting\u2019 it according to their skills and sturdiness.<ref name=\"Somers Heidhues 1974\"/>\n\n== Social impact in the Nanyang ==\nThe Nanyang region has been in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] of influence for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Shmidheise 2008\">{{cite book|last=Shmidheise|first=Klaus|title=The Plaid Avenger's World|date=2008|location=United States of America}}</ref> Therefore, the rise in the role and influence of the ethnic Chinese is extremely important for the understanding of the region.<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\">{{cite book|title=ASEAN-China Relations: Realities and Prospects|date=2005|publisher=ISEAS Publications|location=Singapore|author=Saw Swee-Hock|author2=Sheng Lijun |author3=Chin Kin Wah }}</ref> The [[Chinese philosophy]], [[religion]], [[political philosophies]], governmental standards and overall way of life have been transferred to the Great Golden Peninsula.<ref name=\"Shmidheise 2008\"/>\n\nOne of the many examples of China's influence over the region is the Chinese [[Lunar New Year]], commonly referred to as \u201c[[Chinese New Year]]\u201d. It is celebrated and is an official public holiday in many countries of the Nanyang region (Vietnam, [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]]).<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\"/> Another prominent example is the original roots of the people in the region; a significant portion of the population of the Nanyang region originated in China, especially when it comes to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore.<ref name=\"Shmidheise 2008\"/>\n\nMore specifically, Chinese influence in Thailand is seen in a rise in [[Thai Chinese|Thai-Chinese]] power, not only in commerce and business but also in politics, bureaucracy and intelligentsia. In Indonesia, some news bulletins are in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], whilst in Singapore, one of the [[Languages of Singapore|four official languages]] is Mandarin. Vietnam has been following the 'China model' politically and economically; like in China, Vietnamese from overseas have led and been the most significant contributors of the economic recovery of the country. Malaysia experiences Chinese cultural influence through Chinese tycoons; they play a prominent role in leading the economic boom and inspire reforms to Malaysia\u2019s [[Malay supremacy]] policy.<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\"/>\n\nThe anti-Chinese sentiment of the Nanyang has subsided in recent years as Chinese influence results in prosperous rather than communist results. This has generated amongst many Nanyang-Chinese the will to rediscover their cultural identity in line with the emerging China of the north. One of the impacts of this rediscovery in the Nanyang region, is a boom in Mandarin classes.<ref name=\"Saw Swee-Hock 2005\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Golden Chersonese]], another gold-related name for the region from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], although it referred more specifically to the [[Malay Peninsula]]\n*[[South Seas Communist Party|Nanyang Communist Party]]\n*[[Nusantara]]\n*[[South China Sea]]\n*[[Southeast Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lewismicropublishing.com/Publications/AnthropologicalEssays/UrbanDimensionsNanyangPoliticalEconomy.htm Urban dimension of the political economy of Nanyang ethnicity]\n*[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/42850/rec/1 Art of Island Southeast Asia], a full text exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n[[Category:Chinese emigration]]\n[[Category:Geography of Southeast Asia]]\n[[Category:History of Southeast Asia]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of China]]\n[[Category:Chinese exonyms]]\n[[Category:Historical Chinese exonyms]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_(region)"}
