It was created by John Finch and made by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] for ITV. The original producer was Richard Doubleday, and there were 13 directors during the series. The series examined the lives of the lower-middle-class Ashton family of the city of [[Liverpool]] and their experiences from 1938 and through the [[Second World War]]. Despite being set in Liverpool, only one of the regular characters (David Ashton) spoke with a [[Liverpudlian accent]].\n\nFifty-two episodes were produced, all but eight of them in colour. Episodes numbers 25 to 32 were recorded in black and white because of the ITV [[Colour Strike]]. The memorable theme tune is from the end of the First Movement (Allegro) of [[Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|Sixth Symphony]]. The programme opening titles show a scene of a beach with a child's [[Sand art and play|sand castle]], with [[Union Flag]] flying, slowly being approached by the encroaching tide, symbolic of a beleaguered Britain standing alone in 1940\u201341.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe families Ashton, Briggs and Porter live in Liverpool in 1938 and later. Edwin Ashton, the son of a mineworker, has moved up to the middle class by working for a printing company and by marrying Jean, the sister of company owner Sefton Briggs. The latter is a hard businessman who appoints his son Tony as the new manager of the workplace, rather than the experienced Edwin.\n\nEdwin and Jean have five children: Philip, David, Robert, Margaret and Freda. Philip is a leftist who fought as a volunteer in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. David joins the RAF because he can't find another job. He's married to Sheila but he impregnates Peggy. Robert, the youngest son, wants to join the Navy. Margaret, the eldest Ashton daughter, marries John Porter but she has a troubled relationship with her mother-in-law Celia. All these events take place against the backdrop of the political conflict leading to the [[Second World War]], which will have a major impact on their lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Douglas (actor)|Colin Douglas]] as Edwin Ashton\n* [[Shelagh Fraser]] as Jean Ashton\n* [[Colin Campbell (actor)|Colin Campbell]] as David Ashton\n* [[Barbara Flynn]] as Freda Ashton\n* [[Keith Drinkel]] as Philip Ashton\n* [[David Dixon]] as Robert Ashton\n* Lesley Nunnerley as Margaret Porter\n* [[Coral Atkins]] as Sheila Ashton\n* John McKelvey as Sefton Briggs\n* [[Trevor Bowen|T.R.

In France and Japan, who have maintained [[progressive taxation]] there has not been an increase in inequality.  In Switzerland, where progressive taxation was never implemented, compression never occurred.<ref>[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezAEAPP06.pdf Piketty and Saez.  The evolution of top incomes:  An international comparison.]</ref>  \n\nEconomist [[Paul Krugman]] gives credit for the compression not only to progressive income taxation but to other [[New Deal]] and [[World War II]] policies of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. From about 1937 to 1947 highly progressive taxation, the strengthening of unions of the New Deal, and the wage and price controls of the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]] during World War II, raised the income of the poor and working class and lowered that of top earners.  Krugman argues these explanations are more convincing than the conventional [[Kuznets curve]] cycle of inequality driven by market forces because a natural change would have been gradual and not sudden as the compression was.<ref>[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]], ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', pp. 7\u20138, 47\u201352</ref> \n\nExplanation for the length of the compression's lasting have attributed to the lack of immigrant labor in the US during that time (immigrants often not being able to vote and so support their political interests) and the strength of unions, exemplified by [[Reuther's Treaty of Detroit]]\u2014a landmark 1949 business-labor bargain struck between the [[United Auto Workers]] union and [[General Motors]]. Under that agreement, UAW members were guaranteed wages that rose with productivity, as well as health and retirement benefits. In return GM had relatively few strikes, slowdowns, etc. Unions helped limit increases in executive pay. Further, members of Congress in both political parties significantly overlapped in their voting records and relatively more politicians advocated centrist positions with a general acceptance of New Deal policies.<ref>[[Paul Krugman]], ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', pp. 134, 138</ref> \n\nThe end of income compression has been credited to \"impersonal forces\", such as technological change and globalization, but also to political and policy changes that affected institutions (e.g., unions) and norms (e.g., acceptable executive pay). Krugman argues that the rise of \"movement conservatism\"\u2014a \"highly cohesive set of interlocking institutions that brought Ronald Reagan and [[Newt Gingrich]] to power\"\u2014beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s brought lower taxes on the rich and significant holes in the [[social safety net]]. The relative power of unions declined significantly along with union membership, and executive pay rose considerably relative to average worker pay.<ref name=Krugman>[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/introducing-this-blog/ introducing this blog] (see graph), Paul Krugman</ref> The reversal of the great compression has been called \"the [[Great Divergence (inequality)|Great Divergence]]\" by Krugman and is the title of a ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article and book by [[Timothy Noah]].<ref>[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence By Timothy Noah]</ref>  Krugman also notes that era before the Great Divergence was one not only of relative equality but of economic growth far surpassing the \"Great Divergence\".<ref>\n*2.7%/average annual growth of real income of typical family for the postwar boom, from 1947 to 1973; compared to \n*0.7%/annual income growth for the modern era of reasonable growth with rising inequality, from 1980 until the present.

In Switzerland, where progressive taxation was never implemented, compression never occurred.<ref>[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezAEAPP06.pdf Piketty and Saez.  The evolution of top incomes:  An international comparison.]</ref>  \n\nEconomist [[Paul Krugman]] gives credit for the compression not only to progressive income taxation but to other [[New Deal]] and [[World War II]] policies of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. From about 1937 to 1947 highly progressive taxation, the strengthening of unions of the New Deal, and the wage and price controls of the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]] during World War II, raised the income of the poor and working class and lowered that of top earners.  Krugman argues these explanations are more convincing than the conventional [[Kuznets curve]] cycle of inequality driven by market forces because a natural change would have been gradual and not sudden as the compression was.<ref>[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]], ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', pp. 7\u20138, 47\u201352</ref> \n\nExplanation for the length of the compression's lasting have attributed to the lack of immigrant labor in the US during that time (immigrants often not being able to vote and so support their political interests) and the strength of unions, exemplified by [[Reuther's Treaty of Detroit]]\u2014a landmark 1949 business-labor bargain struck between the [[United Auto Workers]] union and [[General Motors]]. Under that agreement, UAW members were guaranteed wages that rose with productivity, as well as health and retirement benefits. In return GM had relatively few strikes, slowdowns, etc. Unions helped limit increases in executive pay. Further, members of Congress in both political parties significantly overlapped in their voting records and relatively more politicians advocated centrist positions with a general acceptance of New Deal policies.<ref>[[Paul Krugman]], ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', pp. 134, 138</ref> \n\nThe end of income compression has been credited to \"impersonal forces\", such as technological change and globalization, but also to political and policy changes that affected institutions (e.g., unions) and norms (e.g., acceptable executive pay). Krugman argues that the rise of \"movement conservatism\"\u2014a \"highly cohesive set of interlocking institutions that brought Ronald Reagan and [[Newt Gingrich]] to power\"\u2014beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s brought lower taxes on the rich and significant holes in the [[social safety net]]. The relative power of unions declined significantly along with union membership, and executive pay rose considerably relative to average worker pay.<ref name=Krugman>[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/introducing-this-blog/ introducing this blog] (see graph), Paul Krugman</ref> The reversal of the great compression has been called \"the [[Great Divergence (inequality)|Great Divergence]]\" by Krugman and is the title of a ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article and book by [[Timothy Noah]].<ref>[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence By Timothy Noah]</ref>  Krugman also notes that era before the Great Divergence was one not only of relative equality but of economic growth far surpassing the \"Great Divergence\".<ref>\n*2.7%/average annual growth of real income of typical family for the postwar boom, from 1947 to 1973; compared to \n*0.7%/annual income growth for the modern era of reasonable growth with rising inequality, from 1980 until the present.

The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}. However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

Although the F2 cars were good (and Lauda's driving skills impressed March principal Robin Herd), March's 1972 F1 season was catastrophic. Perhaps the lowest point of the team's season came at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, where both March cars were disqualified within 3 laps of each other after just past 3/4 race distance. Lauda took out another bank loan to buy his way into the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] team in 1973. Lauda was instantly quick, but the team was in decline; his big break came when his BRM teammate [[Clay Regazzoni]] left to rejoin [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in 1974 and team owner [[Enzo Ferrari]] asked him what he thought of Lauda. Regazzoni spoke so favourably of Lauda that Ferrari promptly signed him, paying him enough to clear his debts.\n\n==Ferrari (1974\u20131977)==\n{{see also|Hunt\u2013Lauda rivalry}}\n[[File:LaudaNiki19760731Ferrari312T2.jpg|thumb|Lauda practicing at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] during the [[1976 German Grand Prix]].]]\nAfter an unsuccessful start to the 1970s culminating in a disastrous start to the 1973 season, Ferrari regrouped completely under [[Luca di Montezemolo]] and were resurgent in [[1974 Formula One season|1974]].

His first [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] (GP) victory \u2013 and the first for Ferrari since 1972 \u2013 followed only three races later in the [[1974 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]]. Although Lauda became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive [[pole position]]s, a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only one more race that year, the [[1974 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch GP]]. He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car.\n\n[[File:Niki Lauda, 1975 British Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 1975.]]\nThe [[1975 Formula One season|1975 F1 season]] started slowly for Lauda; after no better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the next five driving the new [[Ferrari 312T]]. His first World Championship was confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza; Lauda's teammate Regazzoni won the race and Ferrari clinched their first Constructors' Championship in 11 years; Lauda then picked up a fifth win at the last race of the year, the [[1975 United States Grand Prix|United States GP]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]]. He also became the first driver to lap the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] Nordschleife in under seven minutes, which was considered a huge feat as the Nordschleife section of the N\u00fcrburgring was two miles longer than it is today. Lauda was known for giving away any trophies he won to his local garage in exchange for his car to be washed and serviced.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gerald Donaldson | title=Formula One Drivers Hall of Fame \u2013 Nikki Lauda | publisher=[[Formula One|Formula One web site]] | url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/221 | date= | accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnlike 1975 and despite tensions between Lauda and Montezemolo's successor, [[Daniele Audetto]], Lauda dominated the start of the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 F1 season]], winning four of the first six races and finishing second in the other two. By the time of his fifth win of the year at the [[1976 British Grand Prix|British GP]], he had more than double the points of his closest challengers [[Jody Scheckter]] and [[James Hunt]], and a second consecutive World Championship appeared a formality. It would be a feat not achieved since [[Jack Brabham]]'s victories in [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]]. He also looked set to win the most races in a season, a record held by the late [[Jim Clark]] since [[1963 Formula One season|1963]].\n\n===1976 N\u00fcrburgring crash===\nA week before the [[1976 German Grand Prix]] at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], even though he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the {{convert|23|km|adj=on}} circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit, including lack of fire marshals, fire and safety equipment and safety vehicles.  Formula One was quite dangerous at the time (three of the drivers that day would later die in Formula One incidents: [[Tom Pryce]] in 1977; [[Ronnie Peterson]] in 1978; and [[Patrick Depailler]] in 1980), but a majority of the drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead.\n\n[[File:Lauda accidente2.jpg|thumb|right|Niki Lauda's car on fire]]\nOn 1 August 1976 during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, hit an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with [[Brett Lunger]]'s [[Surtees]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. Drivers [[Arturo Merzario]], Lunger, [[Guy Edwards]], and [[Harald Ertl]] arrived at the scene a few moments later, but before Merzario was able to pull Lauda from his car, he suffered severe burns to his head and inhaled hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In the name of glory|last=Rubython, Tom.|date=2011|publisher=Myrtle|others=Watson, John., Schleglmilch, Rainer.|isbn=978-0-9565656-9-3|location=London|oclc=757931377}}</ref>  In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live (\"I Was There -- May 21, 2019\"; \"Niki Lauda speaks in 2015\"), Lauda said, \"...there were basically two or three drivers trying to get me out of the car, but one was Arturo Merzario, the Italian guy, who also had to stop there at the scene, because I blocked the road; and he really came into the car himself, and uh, triggered my, my seatbelt loose, and then pulled me out.

He chose to limit reconstructive surgery to replacing the eyelids and getting them to work properly.   After the accident he always wore a cap to cover the scars on his head. He arranged for sponsors to use the cap for advertising.\n\nWith Lauda out of the contest, [[Carlos Reutemann]] was taken on as his replacement. Ferrari boycotted the [[1976 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] in protest at what they saw as preferential treatment shown towards [[McLaren]] driver [[James Hunt]] at the Spanish and British Grands Prix.\n\n===Return to racing===\nLauda missed only two races, appearing at the Monza press conference six weeks after the accident with his fresh burns still bandaged. He finished fourth in the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian GP]], despite being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified. F1 journalist [[Nigel Roebuck]] recalls seeing Lauda in the pits, peeling the blood-soaked bandages off his scarred scalp. He also had to wear a specially adapted crash helmet so as to not be in too much discomfort. In Lauda's absence, Hunt had mounted a late charge to reduce Lauda's lead in the World Championship standings. Hunt and Lauda were friends away from the circuit, and their personal on-track rivalry, while intense, was cleanly contested and fair. Following wins in the [[1976 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] and [[1976 United States Grand Prix|United States]] Grands Prix, Hunt stood only three points behind Lauda before the final race of the season, the [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]].\n\nLauda qualified third, one place behind Hunt, but on race day there was torrential rain and Lauda retired after two laps. He later said that he felt it was unsafe to continue under these conditions, especially since his eyes were watering excessively because of his fire-damaged tear ducts and inability to blink. Hunt led much of the race before his tires blistered and a pit stop dropped him down the order. He recovered to third, thus winning the title by a single point.\n\nLauda's previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his decision to withdraw from the Japanese Grand Prix, and he endured a difficult [[1977 Formula One season|1977 season]], despite easily winning the championship through consistency rather than outright pace. Lauda disliked his new teammate, Reutemann, who had served as his replacement driver. Lauda was not comfortable with this move and felt he had been let down by Ferrari. \"We never could stand each other, and instead of taking pressure off me, they put on even more by bringing Carlos Reutemann into the team.\"<ref>Tom Rubython: ''In the Name of Glory \u2013 1976'' Myrtle Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9565656-9-3}}, p. 187</ref> Having announced his decision to quit Ferrari at season's end, Lauda left earlier after he won the Drivers' Championship at the [[1977 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]]  because of the team's decision to run the unknown [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in a third car at the [[1977 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\n==Brabham and first retirement (1978\u20131979)==\n[[File:Lauda at 1978 Dutch Grand Prix (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] at Zandvoort (1978)]]Joining Parmalat-sponsored [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in 1978 for a $1&nbsp;million salary, Lauda endured two unsuccessful seasons, remembered mainly for his one race in the [[Brabham BT46|Brabham BT46B]], a radical design known as the Fan Car: it won its first and only race at the Swedish GP, but Brabham did not use the car in F1 again; other teams vigorously protested the fan car's legality and Brabham team owner [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who at the time was maneuvering for acquisition of Formula One's commercial rights, did not want to fight a protracted battle over the car, but the victory in Sweden remained official. The Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo flat-12 began the 1978 season at the third race in South Africa. It suffered from a variety of troubles that forced Lauda to retire the car 9 out of 14 races. Lauda's best results, apart from the wins in Sweden and Italy after the penalization of Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, were 2nd in Montreal and Great Britain, and a 3rd in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Alfa flat-12 engine was too wide for ground effect designs in that the opposed cylinder banks impeded with the venturi tunnels, so Alfa designed a V12 for 1979. It was the fourth 12-cylinder engine design that propelled the Austrian in F1 since 1973. Lauda's 1979 F1 season was again marred by retirements and poor pace, even though he won the non-championship [[1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix]] with the Brabham-Alfa. In the single make [[BMW M1 Procar Championship]], driving for the British Formula Two team [[Project Four Racing]] (led by [[Ron Dennis]]) when not in a factory entry, Lauda won three races for P4 plus the series. Decades later, Lauda won a BMW Procar exhibition race event before the [[2008 German Grand Prix]].\n\nIn September, Lauda finished 4th in Monza, and won the non-WC Imola event, still with the Alfa V12 engine. After that, Brabham returned to the familiar Cosworth V8. In late September, during practice for the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix]], Lauda cut short a practice session and promptly informed team principal Ecclestone, that he wished to retire immediately, as he had no more desire to \"continue the silliness of driving around in circles\". Lauda, who in the meantime had founded Lauda Air, a charter airline, returned to Austria to run the company full-time.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\">{{cite news |last1=Benson |first1=Andrew |title=Niki Lauda obituary: 'A remarkable life lived in Technicolour' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46781936 |accessdate=21 May 2019 |work=BBC |date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==McLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982\u20131985)==\n[[File:Lauda McLaren MP4-2 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Five years after his first retirement, Lauda won his third title driving a [[McLaren MP4/2]].]]\nIn 1982 Lauda returned to racing, for an unprecedented $3&nbsp;million salary.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\" /> After a successful test with [[McLaren]], the only problem was to convince then team sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] that he was still capable of winning. Lauda proved he was when, in his third race back, he won the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach Grand Prix]]. Before the opening race of the season at [[Kyalami]] race track in [[South Africa]], Lauda was the organiser of the so-called \"drivers' strike\"; Lauda had seen that the new [[FIA Super Licence|Super Licence]] required the drivers to commit themselves to their present teams and realised that this could hinder a driver's negotiating position. The drivers, with the exception of [[Teo Fabi]], barricaded themselves in a banqueting suite at Sunnyside Park Hotel until they had won the day.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 79ff</ref>\n\nThe 1983 season proved to be transitional for the McLaren team as they were making a change from Ford-Cosworth power to TAG-badged Porsche turbo power, and Lauda did not win a race that year, with his best finish being 2nd at Long Beach behind his teammate John Watson. Some political maneuvering by Lauda forced a furious chief designer [[John Barnard]] to design an interim car earlier than expected to get the TAG-Porsche engine some much needed race testing; Lauda nearly won the last race of the season in South Africa.\n\nLauda won a third world championship in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]] by half a point over teammate [[Alain Prost]], due only to half points being awarded for the shortened [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix]]. His [[1984 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] victory that year is so far the only time an Austrian has won his home Grand Prix. Initially, Lauda did not want Prost to become his teammate, as he presented a much faster rival. However, during the two seasons together, they had a good relationship and Lauda later said that beating the talented Frenchman was a big motivator for him.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 153</ref> The whole season continued to be dominated by Lauda and Prost, who won 12 of 16 races. Lauda won five races, while Prost won seven. However, Lauda, who set a record for the most pole positions in a season during the 1975 season, rarely matched his teammate in qualifying. Despite this, Lauda's championship win came in [[1984 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], when he had to start in eleventh place on the grid, while Prost qualified on the front row. Prost did everything he could, starting from second and winning his 7th race of the season, but Lauda's calculating drive (which included setting the fastest race lap), passing car after car, saw him finish second behind his teammate which gave him enough points to win his third title. His second place was a lucky one though as [[Nigel Mansell]] was in second for much of the race. However, as it was his last race with [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] before joining [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in 1985, Lotus boss [[Peter Warr]] refused to give Mansell the brakes he wanted for [[Lotus 95T|his car]] and the Englishman retired with brake failure on lap 52. As Lauda had passed the [[Toleman TG184|Toleman]] of F1 rookie [[Ayrton Senna]] for third place only a few laps earlier, Mansell's retirement elevated him to second behind Prost.\n\nThe 1985 season was a disappointment for Lauda, with eleven retirements from the fourteen races he started. He did not start the [[1985 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] after crashing and breaking his wrist during practice, and he later missed the [[1985 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]]; John Watson replaced him for that race. He did manage 4th at the [[1985 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], 5th at the [[1985 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], and a single race win at the [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]] where he held off a fast finishing Prost late in the race. This proved to be his last Grand Prix victory and also the last Formula One Grand Prix held in the [[Netherlands]]. After announcing his impending retirement at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix]], he retired for good at the end of that season.\n\nLauda's final Formula One Grand Prix drive was the inaugural [[Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. After qualifying 16th, a steady drive saw him leading by lap 53. However, the McLaren's ceramic brakes suffered on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] and he crashed out of the lead at the end of the long Brabham Straight on lap 57 when his brakes finally failed. He was one of only two drivers in the race who had driven in the non-championship [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]], the other being {{f1|1982}} World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]], who won in Adelaide in 1985 and would take Lauda's place at McLaren in 1986.\n[[File:Niki Lauda helmet Museo Ferrari.jpg|thumb|Niki Lauda helmet from the 1970s, at the [[Museo Ferrari]] in Maranello]]\n\n===Helmet===\nLauda's helmet was originally a plain red with his full name written on both sides and the Raiffeisen Bank logo in the chin area. He wore a modified AGV helmet in the weeks following his N\u00fcrburgring accident so as the lining would not aggravate his burned scalp too badly. In 1982, upon his return to McLaren, his helmet was white and featured the red \"L\" logo of Lauda Air instead of his name on both sides, complete with branding from his personal sponsor Parmalat on the top. From 1983\u20131985, the red and white were reversed to evoke memories of his earlier helmet design.\n\n==Later management roles==\nIn 1993 Lauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position when Luca di Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari. Halfway through the 2001 season Lauda assumed the role of team principal of the Jaguar Formula One team. The team, however, failed to improve and Lauda was made redundant, together with 70 other key figures, at the end of 2002.\n\nIn September 2012 he was appointed [[Chairman|non-executive chairman]] of the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lauda to join Mercedes in advisory role | publisher=GPUpdate.net | url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | date=28 September 2012 | accessdate=7 October 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003074703/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | archive-date=3 October 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> He took part in negotiations to sign [[Lewis Hamilton]] to a three-year deal with Mercedes.\n\n==Roles beyond Formula One==\n[[File:Andreas Nikolaus Lauda 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 2011]]\nLauda returned to running his airline, [[Lauda Air]], on his second Formula One retirement in 1985.

Juli 2010.</ref>\n\nLauda was quickly promoted to the F1 team, but drove for March in F1 and F2 in 1972. Although the F2 cars were good (and Lauda's driving skills impressed March principal Robin Herd), March's 1972 F1 season was catastrophic. Perhaps the lowest point of the team's season came at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, where both March cars were disqualified within 3 laps of each other after just past 3/4 race distance. Lauda took out another bank loan to buy his way into the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] team in 1973. Lauda was instantly quick, but the team was in decline; his big break came when his BRM teammate [[Clay Regazzoni]] left to rejoin [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in 1974 and team owner [[Enzo Ferrari]] asked him what he thought of Lauda. Regazzoni spoke so favourably of Lauda that Ferrari promptly signed him, paying him enough to clear his debts.\n\n==Ferrari (1974\u20131977)==\n{{see also|Hunt\u2013Lauda rivalry}}\n[[File:LaudaNiki19760731Ferrari312T2.jpg|thumb|Lauda practicing at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] during the [[1976 German Grand Prix]].]]\nAfter an unsuccessful start to the 1970s culminating in a disastrous start to the 1973 season, Ferrari regrouped completely under [[Luca di Montezemolo]] and were resurgent in [[1974 Formula One season|1974]]. The team's faith in the little-known Lauda was quickly rewarded by a second-place finish in his debut race for the team, the season-opening [[1974 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentine Grand Prix]]. His first [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] (GP) victory \u2013 and the first for Ferrari since 1972 \u2013 followed only three races later in the [[1974 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]]. Although Lauda became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive [[pole position]]s, a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only one more race that year, the [[1974 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch GP]]. He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car.\n\n[[File:Niki Lauda, 1975 British Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 1975.]]\nThe [[1975 Formula One season|1975 F1 season]] started slowly for Lauda; after no better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the next five driving the new [[Ferrari 312T]]. His first World Championship was confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza; Lauda's teammate Regazzoni won the race and Ferrari clinched their first Constructors' Championship in 11 years; Lauda then picked up a fifth win at the last race of the year, the [[1975 United States Grand Prix|United States GP]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]]. He also became the first driver to lap the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] Nordschleife in under seven minutes, which was considered a huge feat as the Nordschleife section of the N\u00fcrburgring was two miles longer than it is today. Lauda was known for giving away any trophies he won to his local garage in exchange for his car to be washed and serviced.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gerald Donaldson | title=Formula One Drivers Hall of Fame \u2013 Nikki Lauda | publisher=[[Formula One|Formula One web site]] | url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/221 | date= | accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnlike 1975 and despite tensions between Lauda and Montezemolo's successor, [[Daniele Audetto]], Lauda dominated the start of the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 F1 season]], winning four of the first six races and finishing second in the other two. By the time of his fifth win of the year at the [[1976 British Grand Prix|British GP]], he had more than double the points of his closest challengers [[Jody Scheckter]] and [[James Hunt]], and a second consecutive World Championship appeared a formality. It would be a feat not achieved since [[Jack Brabham]]'s victories in [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]]. He also looked set to win the most races in a season, a record held by the late [[Jim Clark]] since [[1963 Formula One season|1963]].\n\n===1976 N\u00fcrburgring crash===\nA week before the [[1976 German Grand Prix]] at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], even though he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the {{convert|23|km|adj=on}} circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit, including lack of fire marshals, fire and safety equipment and safety vehicles.  Formula One was quite dangerous at the time (three of the drivers that day would later die in Formula One incidents: [[Tom Pryce]] in 1977; [[Ronnie Peterson]] in 1978; and [[Patrick Depailler]] in 1980), but a majority of the drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead.\n\n[[File:Lauda accidente2.jpg|thumb|right|Niki Lauda's car on fire]]\nOn 1 August 1976 during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, hit an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with [[Brett Lunger]]'s [[Surtees]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. Drivers [[Arturo Merzario]], Lunger, [[Guy Edwards]], and [[Harald Ertl]] arrived at the scene a few moments later, but before Merzario was able to pull Lauda from his car, he suffered severe burns to his head and inhaled hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In the name of glory|last=Rubython, Tom.|date=2011|publisher=Myrtle|others=Watson, John., Schleglmilch, Rainer.|isbn=978-0-9565656-9-3|location=London|oclc=757931377}}</ref>  In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live (\"I Was There -- May 21, 2019\"; \"Niki Lauda speaks in 2015\"), Lauda said, \"...there were basically two or three drivers trying to get me out of the car, but one was Arturo Merzario, the Italian guy, who also had to stop there at the scene, because I blocked the road; and he really came into the car himself, and uh, triggered my, my seatbelt loose, and then pulled me out.  It was unbelievable, how he could do that, and I met him afterwards, and I said, 'How could you do it?!'.

He chose to limit reconstructive surgery to replacing the eyelids and getting them to work properly.   After the accident he always wore a cap to cover the scars on his head. He arranged for sponsors to use the cap for advertising.\n\nWith Lauda out of the contest, [[Carlos Reutemann]] was taken on as his replacement. Ferrari boycotted the [[1976 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] in protest at what they saw as preferential treatment shown towards [[McLaren]] driver [[James Hunt]] at the Spanish and British Grands Prix.\n\n===Return to racing===\nLauda missed only two races, appearing at the Monza press conference six weeks after the accident with his fresh burns still bandaged. He finished fourth in the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian GP]], despite being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified. F1 journalist [[Nigel Roebuck]] recalls seeing Lauda in the pits, peeling the blood-soaked bandages off his scarred scalp. He also had to wear a specially adapted crash helmet so as to not be in too much discomfort. In Lauda's absence, Hunt had mounted a late charge to reduce Lauda's lead in the World Championship standings. Hunt and Lauda were friends away from the circuit, and their personal on-track rivalry, while intense, was cleanly contested and fair. Following wins in the [[1976 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] and [[1976 United States Grand Prix|United States]] Grands Prix, Hunt stood only three points behind Lauda before the final race of the season, the [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]].\n\nLauda qualified third, one place behind Hunt, but on race day there was torrential rain and Lauda retired after two laps. He later said that he felt it was unsafe to continue under these conditions, especially since his eyes were watering excessively because of his fire-damaged tear ducts and inability to blink. Hunt led much of the race before his tires blistered and a pit stop dropped him down the order. He recovered to third, thus winning the title by a single point.\n\nLauda's previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his decision to withdraw from the Japanese Grand Prix, and he endured a difficult [[1977 Formula One season|1977 season]], despite easily winning the championship through consistency rather than outright pace. Lauda disliked his new teammate, Reutemann, who had served as his replacement driver. Lauda was not comfortable with this move and felt he had been let down by Ferrari. \"We never could stand each other, and instead of taking pressure off me, they put on even more by bringing Carlos Reutemann into the team.\"<ref>Tom Rubython: ''In the Name of Glory \u2013 1976'' Myrtle Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9565656-9-3}}, p. 187</ref> Having announced his decision to quit Ferrari at season's end, Lauda left earlier after he won the Drivers' Championship at the [[1977 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]]  because of the team's decision to run the unknown [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in a third car at the [[1977 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\n==Brabham and first retirement (1978\u20131979)==\n[[File:Lauda at 1978 Dutch Grand Prix (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] at Zandvoort (1978)]]Joining Parmalat-sponsored [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in 1978 for a $1 million salary, Lauda endured two unsuccessful seasons, remembered mainly for his one race in the [[Brabham BT46|Brabham BT46B]], a radical design known as the Fan Car: it won its first and only race at the Swedish GP, but Brabham did not use the car in F1 again; other teams vigorously protested the fan car's legality and Brabham team owner [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who at the time was maneuvering for acquisition of Formula One's commercial rights, did not want to fight a protracted battle over the car, but the victory in Sweden remained official. The Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo flat-12 began the 1978 season at the third race in South Africa. It suffered from a variety of troubles that forced Lauda to retire the car 9 out of 14 races. Lauda's best results, apart from the wins in Sweden and Italy after the penalization of Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, were 2nd in Montreal and Great Britain, and a 3rd in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Alfa flat-12 engine was too wide for ground effect designs in that the opposed cylinder banks impeded with the venturi tunnels, so Alfa designed a V12 for 1979. It was the fourth 12-cylinder engine design that propelled the Austrian in F1 since 1973. Lauda's 1979 F1 season was again marred by retirements and poor pace, even though he won the non-championship [[1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix]] with the Brabham-Alfa. In the single make [[BMW M1 Procar Championship]], driving for the British Formula Two team [[Project Four Racing]] (led by [[Ron Dennis]]) when not in a factory entry, Lauda won three races for P4 plus the series. Decades later, Lauda won a BMW Procar exhibition race event before the [[2008 German Grand Prix]].\n\nIn September, Lauda finished 4th in Monza, and won the non-WC Imola event, still with the Alfa V12 engine. After that, Brabham returned to the familiar Cosworth V8. In late September, during practice for the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix]], Lauda cut short a practice session and promptly informed team principal Ecclestone, that he wished to retire immediately, as he had no more desire to \"continue the silliness of driving around in circles\". Lauda, who in the meantime had founded Lauda Air, a charter airline, returned to Austria to run the company full-time.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\">{{cite news |last1=Benson |first1=Andrew |title=Niki Lauda obituary: 'A remarkable life lived in Technicolour' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46781936 |accessdate=21 May 2019 |work=BBC |date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==McLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982\u20131985)==\n[[File:Lauda McLaren MP4-2 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Five years after his first retirement, Lauda won his third title driving a [[McLaren MP4/2]].]]\nIn 1982 Lauda returned to racing, for an unprecedented $3 million salary.<ref name=\"BBCSportObit\" /> After a successful test with [[McLaren]], the only problem was to convince then team sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] that he was still capable of winning. Lauda proved he was when, in his third race back, he won the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach Grand Prix]]. Before the opening race of the season at [[Kyalami]] race track in [[South Africa]], Lauda was the organiser of the so-called \"drivers' strike\"; Lauda had seen that the new [[FIA Super Licence|Super Licence]] required the drivers to commit themselves to their present teams and realised that this could hinder a driver's negotiating position. The drivers, with the exception of [[Teo Fabi]], barricaded themselves in a banqueting suite at Sunnyside Park Hotel until they had won the day.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 79ff</ref>\n\nThe 1983 season proved to be transitional for the McLaren team as they were making a change from Ford-Cosworth power to TAG-badged Porsche turbo power, and Lauda did not win a race that year, with his best finish being 2nd at Long Beach behind his teammate John Watson. Some political maneuvering by Lauda forced a furious chief designer [[John Barnard]] to design an interim car earlier than expected to get the TAG-Porsche engine some much needed race testing; Lauda nearly won the last race of the season in South Africa.\n\nLauda won a third world championship in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]] by half a point over teammate [[Alain Prost]], due only to half points being awarded for the shortened [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix]]. His [[1984 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] victory that year is so far the only time an Austrian has won his home Grand Prix. Initially, Lauda did not want Prost to become his teammate, as he presented a much faster rival. However, during the two seasons together, they had a good relationship and Lauda later said that beating the talented Frenchman was a big motivator for him.<ref>Malcolm Folley: ''Senna versus Prost'' Century, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-8460-5540-9}}, p. 153</ref> The whole season continued to be dominated by Lauda and Prost, who won 12 of 16 races. Lauda won five races, while Prost won seven. However, Lauda, who set a record for the most pole positions in a season during the 1975 season, rarely matched his teammate in qualifying. Despite this, Lauda's championship win came in [[1984 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], when he had to start in eleventh place on the grid, while Prost qualified on the front row. Prost did everything he could, starting from second and winning his 7th race of the season, but Lauda's calculating drive (which included setting the fastest race lap), passing car after car, saw him finish second behind his teammate which gave him enough points to win his third title. His second place was a lucky one though as [[Nigel Mansell]] was in second for much of the race. However, as it was his last race with [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] before joining [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in 1985, Lotus boss [[Peter Warr]] refused to give Mansell the brakes he wanted for [[Lotus 95T|his car]] and the Englishman retired with brake failure on lap 52. As Lauda had passed the [[Toleman TG184|Toleman]] of F1 rookie [[Ayrton Senna]] for third place only a few laps earlier, Mansell's retirement elevated him to second behind Prost.\n\nThe 1985 season was a disappointment for Lauda, with eleven retirements from the fourteen races he started. He did not start the [[1985 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] after crashing and breaking his wrist during practice, and he later missed the [[1985 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]]; John Watson replaced him for that race. He did manage 4th at the [[1985 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], 5th at the [[1985 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], and a single race win at the [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]] where he held off a fast finishing Prost late in the race. This proved to be his last Grand Prix victory and also the last Formula One Grand Prix held in the [[Netherlands]]. After announcing his impending retirement at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix]], he retired for good at the end of that season.\n\nLauda's final Formula One Grand Prix drive was the inaugural [[Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. After qualifying 16th, a steady drive saw him leading by lap 53. However, the McLaren's ceramic brakes suffered on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] and he crashed out of the lead at the end of the long Brabham Straight on lap 57 when his brakes finally failed. He was one of only two drivers in the race who had driven in the non-championship [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]], the other being {{f1|1982}} World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]], who won in Adelaide in 1985 and would take Lauda's place at McLaren in 1986.\n[[File:Niki Lauda helmet Museo Ferrari.jpg|thumb|Niki Lauda helmet from the 1970s, at the [[Museo Ferrari]] in Maranello]]\n\n===Helmet===\nLauda's helmet was originally a plain red with his full name written on both sides and the Raiffeisen Bank logo in the chin area. He wore a modified AGV helmet in the weeks following his N\u00fcrburgring accident so as the lining would not aggravate his burned scalp too badly. In 1982, upon his return to McLaren, his helmet was white and featured the red \"L\" logo of Lauda Air instead of his name on both sides, complete with branding from his personal sponsor Parmalat on the top. From 1983\u20131985, the red and white were reversed to evoke memories of his earlier helmet design.\n\n==Later management roles==\nIn 1993 Lauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position when Luca di Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari. Halfway through the 2001 season Lauda assumed the role of team principal of the Jaguar Formula One team. The team, however, failed to improve and Lauda was made redundant, together with 70 other key figures, at the end of 2002.\n\nIn September 2012 he was appointed [[Chairman|non-executive chairman]] of the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lauda to join Mercedes in advisory role | publisher=GPUpdate.net | url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | date=28 September 2012 | accessdate=7 October 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003074703/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/284707/lauda-to-join-mercedes-in-advisory-role/ | archive-date=3 October 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> He took part in negotiations to sign [[Lewis Hamilton]] to a three-year deal with Mercedes.\n\n==Roles beyond Formula One==\n[[File:Andreas Nikolaus Lauda 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Lauda in 2011]]\nLauda returned to running his airline, [[Lauda Air]], on his second Formula One retirement in 1985.
