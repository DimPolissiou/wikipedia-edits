They face a similar challenge of matching the prestige of older institutions.

This can be represented in IPA by using a succession of two symbols such as {{IPA|[\u0251\u025a]}} or {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}}, rather than the unitary symbol {{IPA|[\u0251\u02de]}}.<ref name=\"Clark\"/>\n\n==== Singing ====\nIn European classical singing, dropping or weakening of r-colored vowels has been nearly universal and is a standard part of classical vocal training. However, there have always been other singing styles in which r-colored vowels are given their full emphasis, including [[traditional Irish singing|traditional Irish singing styles]] and those of many performers of [[country music]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In certain particular cases, a vowel + /r/ is pronounced instead as two syllables: a non-rhotic vowel followed by a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] /r/.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Mandarin Chinese ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|Erhua}}\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the rhotacized ending of some words is the prime way by which to distinguish speakers of Standard Northern Mandarin (Beijing Mandarin) and Southwestern Mandarin from those of other forms of Mandarin in China. Mandarin speakers call this phenomenon ''[[erhua]]''. In many words, the ''-r'' suffix ({{zh|t=\u5152|s=\u513f}}) is added to indicate some meaning changes. If the word ends in a velar nasal (''ng''), the final consonant is lost and the vowel becomes [[nasalization|nasalized]]. Major cities that have this form of rhotacized ending include [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Tangshan]], [[Shenyang]], [[Changchun]], [[Jilin]], [[Harbin]], and [[Qiqihar]]. This ''erhua'' has since spread to other provincial capitals not home to [[Standard Mandarin]], such as [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Jinan]], [[Xian]], [[Chongqing]], and [[Chengdu]].\n\nIn rhotic accents of Standard Mandarin, such as those from [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], most of the [[Hebei]] province (e.g. [[Tangshan]], [[Baoding]], [[Chengde]]), eastern [[Inner Mongolia]] (e.g. [[Chifeng]], [[Hailar District|Hailar]]), and in [[northeastern provinces|the Northeast]], vocalic r occurs as a [[diminutive]] marker of nouns ({{zh|p=\u00e9r}}) and the [[perfective aspect]] particle ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u4e86|p=le}}). This also occurs in the middle syllables of compound words consisting of three or more syllables. For example, the name of the famous restaurant [[Go Believe]] ({{lang|zh|\u72d7\u4e0d\u7406}}) in Tianjin is pronounced as 'Gourbli' (''G\u01d2u(r)b<s>\u00f9</s>l\u01d0'' \u2192 ''G\u01d2urbl\u01d0''). The name of the street [[Dazhalan]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u6805\u680f}}) in Beijing is pronounced as 'Da-shi-lar' (''D\u00e0sh\u00e0<s>n</s>l\u00e0<s>n</s>(r)'' \u2192 ''D\u00e0sh\u00edl\u00e0r'').\n\n=== Quebec French ===\nIn [[Quebec French]], the vowel {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u0153\u0303\u02de]}} and the r-colored vowels are also pronounced in loan words.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} For example, the word ''hamburger'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[amb\u025a\u0261\u025a]}}, the word ''soccer'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[s\u0252k\u025a]}} etc.\n\n=== Other examples ===\nIn the 1930s the [[Dravidian language]] [[Badaga language|Badaga]] had two degrees of rhoticity among all five of its vowels, but few speakers maintain the distinction today, and then only in one or two vowels. An example is non-rhotic {{IPA|[be]}} \"mouth\", slightly rhotacized (\"half retroflexed\") {{IPA|[be\u02de]}} \"bangle\", and fully rhotacized (\"fully retroflexed\") {{IPA|[be\u02de\u02de]}} \"crop\".<ref>http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/badaga/badaga.html <!--The source may be Emeneau, M.B.

The non-high vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} could become {{IPA|/\u025a/}} in a word that has {{IPA|/\u025a/}}.

The r-colored vowels of General American can be written with \"vowel-r\" [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s:<ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite book|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dX5P5mxtYYIC|title=An introduction to phonetics and phonology|author1=John Ellery Clark|author2=Colin Yallop|author3=Janet Fletcher|author3link=Janet Fletcher|edition=third|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, MA|year=2007|isbn=1-4051-3083-0}}</ref>\n*{{IPA|[\u025a]}}: ''h'''ear'''se'', ''ass'''er'''t'', ''m'''ir'''th'' (stressed, conventionally written {{IPA|[\u025d]}}); ''stand'''ar'''d'', ''dinn'''er''''', ''Lincolnshi'''re''''' (unstressed)\n*{{IPA|[\u0251\u02de]}}: ''st'''ar'''t'', ''c'''ar'''''\n*{{IPA|[\u0254\u02de]}}: ''n'''or'''th'', ''w'''ar'''''\n\nIn words such as ''start'', many speakers have r-coloring only in the coda of the vowel, rather than as a simultaneous articulation modifying the whole duration. This can be represented in IPA by using a succession of two symbols such as {{IPA|[\u0251\u025a]}} or {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}}, rather than the unitary symbol {{IPA|[\u0251\u02de]}}.<ref name=\"Clark\"/>\n\n==== Singing ====\nIn European classical singing, dropping or weakening of r-colored vowels has been nearly universal and is a standard part of classical vocal training. However, there have always been other singing styles in which r-colored vowels are given their full emphasis, including [[traditional Irish singing|traditional Irish singing styles]] and those of many performers of [[country music]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In certain particular cases, a vowel + /r/ is pronounced instead as two syllables: a non-rhotic vowel followed by a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] /r/.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Mandarin Chinese ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|Erhua}}\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the rhotacized ending of some words is the prime way by which to distinguish speakers of Standard Northern Mandarin (Beijing Mandarin) and Southwestern Mandarin from those of other forms of Mandarin in China. Mandarin speakers call this phenomenon ''[[erhua]]''. In many words, the ''-r'' suffix ({{zh|t=\u5152|s=\u513f}}) is added to indicate some meaning changes. If the word ends in a velar nasal (''ng''), the final consonant is lost and the vowel becomes [[nasalization|nasalized]]. Major cities that have this form of rhotacized ending include [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Tangshan]], [[Shenyang]], [[Changchun]], [[Jilin]], [[Harbin]], and [[Qiqihar]]. This ''erhua'' has since spread to other provincial capitals not home to [[Standard Mandarin]], such as [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Jinan]], [[Xian]], [[Chongqing]], and [[Chengdu]].\n\nIn rhotic accents of Standard Mandarin, such as those from [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], most of the [[Hebei]] province (e.g. [[Tangshan]], [[Baoding]], [[Chengde]]), eastern [[Inner Mongolia]] (e.g. [[Chifeng]], [[Hailar District|Hailar]]), and in [[northeastern provinces|the Northeast]], vocalic r occurs as a [[diminutive]] marker of nouns ({{zh|p=\u00e9r}}) and the [[perfective aspect]] particle ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u4e86|p=le}}). This also occurs in the middle syllables of compound words consisting of three or more syllables. For example, the name of the famous restaurant [[Go Believe]] ({{lang|zh|\u72d7\u4e0d\u7406}}) in Tianjin is pronounced as 'Gourbli' (''G\u01d2u(r)b<s>\u00f9</s>l\u01d0'' \u2192 ''G\u01d2urbl\u01d0''). The name of the street [[Dazhalan]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u6805\u680f}}) in Beijing is pronounced as 'Da-shi-lar' (''D\u00e0sh\u00e0<s>n</s>l\u00e0<s>n</s>(r)'' \u2192 ''D\u00e0sh\u00edl\u00e0r'').\n\n=== Quebec French ===\nIn [[Quebec French]], the vowel {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u0153\u0303\u02de]}} and the r-colored vowels are also pronounced in loan words.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} For example, the word ''hamburger'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[amb\u025a\u0261\u025a]}}, the word ''soccer'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[s\u0252k\u025a]}} etc.\n\n=== Other examples ===\nIn the 1930s the [[Dravidian language]] [[Badaga language|Badaga]] had two degrees of rhoticity among all five of its vowels, but few speakers maintain the distinction today, and then only in one or two vowels. An example is non-rhotic {{IPA|[be]}} \"mouth\", slightly rhotacized (\"half retroflexed\") {{IPA|[be\u02de]}} \"bangle\", and fully rhotacized (\"fully retroflexed\") {{IPA|[be\u02de\u02de]}} \"crop\".<ref>http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/badaga/badaga.html <!--The source may be Emeneau, M.B.

The non-high vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} could become {{IPA|/\u025a/}} in a word that has {{IPA|/\u025a/}}. For example, the root {{IPA|/nahks-/}} 'three' became {{IPA|/n\u025ahks-/}} in the word {{IPA|/n\u025ahks\u025a\u0294\u025aj\u026c/}} 'three (animals or birds)'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/yurok.php|title=Yurok \u2013 Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu}}</ref>\n\n[[Luobohe Miao]] also contains {{IPA|[\u025a]}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omniglot.com/writing/luobohemiao.htm|title=Luobohe Miao language|website=Omniglot.com}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Linking R]]\n*[[Rhotic consonant]] (r-like)\n*[[Syllabic consonant]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|author1=L.

Founded in 1998, the program features intensive studies in a range of subjects focusing on the sociopolitics of Israel, its history focusing on the pre-state pioneering settlers, Jewish studies, and humanistic-ideological aspects of current events, as well as personal development. The studies are combined with volunteer service in the public school system of outlying communities. The 10-month residential program defers compulsory military service in the framework of the post-secondary \"year of service\" (''sh'nat sherut''), after which its graduates are inducted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. The academy was founded and still directed by [[Danny Zamir]] who is a deputy battalion commander in the reserves.<ref>{{cite news |title=ANALYSIS / Probe into Gaza op allegations comes too late |author=Amos Harel |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=March 20, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFrom its inception, Mechinat Rabin has been sponsored by the [[Oranim Academic College]], Oranim's ''HaMidrasha'' Educational Center for the Renewal of Jewish Life in Israel, the [[United Kibbutz Movement]], and the [[Yitzhak Rabin Center]]. It operates under the auspices of both the Ministry of Education and [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]]. Other supporting institutions include the [[Avi Chai Foundation]], the Jewish Federation of New York, and the [[Jewish Agency]].\n\nClassroom studies at Mechinat Rabin are taught by a core staff, most of whom are graduates of the program, along with hired instructors, with weekly guest lecturers and offsite field trips. Study material is provided by the staff and includes content from Hamidrasha. During the course of the program, each participant prepares and delivers at least one lesson to the group, an hour and a half in length. The year concludes with a tour of the country from south to north, lasting several weeks, visiting a wide variety of populations and locales. Students spend several days attending a [[Mechina#Religious pre-army Mechina|religious pre-army mechinah]] or [[yeshiva]]. The program does not include weapons training or paramilitary drills. Participation in Mechinat Rabin requires a commitment to serve in the IDF, such that a declaration of [[Conscientious objector#Israel|conscientious objection]] would result in expulsion from the program.\n\nThe dormitory facilities on the Oranim campus are converted caravans, with a communal kitchen and dining hall where participants take turns preparing breakfast and supper for the group, and a single building with showers and lavatories. Oranim also provides classroom facilities and the use of its library and cafeteria. In the 2006/7 academic year, Mechinat Rabin had its peak enrollment of 70 recent high-school graduates.\n\nDuring their ''mechinah'' year, participants have regular assignments as volunteers in schools in the [[Galilee]] towns of [[Yokneam Illit|Yoqneam]], [[Migdal Haemek]], and [[Nazareth Illit]], an area hit by unemployment and having limited resources. They work as classroom aides and tutors, and also create extracurricular activities. A growing phenomenon is the return of groups of graduates after their discharge from the IDF, to live in these outlying towns and work in the field of education there.\n\nBesides their volunteer placements, Mechinat Rabin participants are largely responsible for organizing and operating the program's logistics. Committees plan and purchase food, invite the guest lecturers, and find places for temporary jobs by which the participants contribute to financing the program. During several breaks in the study program during the year, they work at temporary jobs in agriculture and education, raising funds to cover 15% of the program's expenses. No tuition or other fees are charged.\n\nFor their compulsory military service, ''mechinah'' participants are encouraged to enter one of two focal tracks: the girls to positions as [[Non-commissioned officers|command]] in the [[Israeli Education and Youth Corps|Education and Youth Corps]], and the boys to the [[Givati Brigade]]. Others are accepted into the commandos and other elite units, intelligence, or are part of a [[Nahal]] group. Members of the Mechinat Rabin educational staff, themselves IDF reservists and most with officers' rank, make periodic visits to groups of graduates at their bases and also are available for personal consultation on an ad hoc basis.\n\nMechinat Rabin publishes a newsletter for its graduates called ''Briza'' (\"Breeze\") it maintains on its website with a discussion forum and activities updates. Throughout the year, Mechinat Rabin hosts Friday and weekend gatherings of graduates, by year or all together (2008\u20139 being the 11th year). These regular gatherings focus on current events and topics related to the mechinah's program content, as well as for developing new and ongoing educational and community projects for the graduates who've returned to civilian life.<ref>Content from Mechinat Rabin's website {{cite web|url=http://rabinm.oranim.ac.il/ |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322165012/http://rabinm.oranim.ac.il/ |archivedate=March 22, 2009 }}<!-- is it http://www.hamidrasha-israel.org/education/rabin-pre-army-leadership-program/ or is it http://friends.oranim.ac.il/node/87 ? -->, {{cite web|publisher=Israel Ministry of Education |title=pre-army preparatory programs |url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Applications/Mankal/EtsMedorim/7/7-1/HodaotVmeyda/ |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}, and informational publications for its students.</ref>\n\n==Mechinat Rabin graduates' testimonies after Operation Cast Lead==\n{{wikinews|IDF soldiers' account of Gaza incursion sparks new war crimes investigations}}\nOn February 13, 2009, a month after [[Operation Cast Lead]], graduates of Mechinat Rabin who had taken part in that [[Gaza City|Gaza]] operation gathered for a discussion of their experiences.
