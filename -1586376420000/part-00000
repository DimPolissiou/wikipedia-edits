Murphree, Bert C. Riley, Dean of General Extension, brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization which would recognize leadership and promote service to the University.  Among the duties assigned to Florida Blue Key were playing host to campus visitors and to be at the call of the President of the University for any duty designated by him.\n\nIn this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing Homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since.  Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad's Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life.  Dad's Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.\n\nThe organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInitially, membership in the organization was ''ex officio''; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.<ref name=\"auto\">Who's Who in Florida Blue Key; Volume XIII</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state's only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education.<ref>Pursuant to the [[Buckman Act]], adopted by the Florida Legislature in 1905, the [[University of Florida]] was reserved for white male students, [[Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]] was reserved for white female students, and [[Florida A & M University|Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]] was a coeducational institution for black students.</ref> During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida.

The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida.

Gator Growl, nicknamed \"Growl\" by some students, usually features comedians such as [[Bill Cosby]], [[Frank Thornton]], and [[Dane Cook]] in addition to the school rallies, but occasionally a top-tier musical act headlines the show.

His first-team opportunities were limited at first behind Scotland scrum half [[Mike Blair]], but in 2010 he signed a new two-year contract.\n\nHis earlier representative rugby included games for Borders under-16 and under-18 as well as Scotland under-18. After stints with the Scotland sevens and under-21 sides, he made his full Scotland debut against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] in November 2010. In January 2011, he was called up to Scotland's Six Nations squad and, although he did not get any game time, he was retained in Andy Robinson's 40-man squad ahead of the World Cup. He captained [[Scotland A national rugby union team|Scotland A]] to wins over the [[Ireland Wolfhounds]] and [[Italy A national rugby union team|Italy A]] in early 2011, and then skippered Edinburgh in the [[Pro14|Celtic League]].\n\n==Club career==\nOn 4 March 2014 it was announced that Laidlaw would depart Murrayfield at the end of the season and join [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] side [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12549/9195424/aviva-premiership-edinburgh-captain-greig-laidlaw-secures-gloucester-move|publisher=Sky Sports|title=Edinburgh and Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw seals Gloucester move|date=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter spending three seasons with English Premiership side Gloucester, Laidlaw would depart [[Kingsholm Stadium|Kingsholm]] at the end of 2016\u201317 season and join French [[Top 14]] side [[Clermont Auvergne]] on a three-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/confirmed-greig-laidlaw-leaving-gloucester-for-france/story-29801869-detail/story.html???#t7pJEZ5ymLMUYCEM.99|publisher=GloucestershireLive|title=Confirmed: Greig Laidlaw Leaving Gloucester Rugby for France|date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n\n===Scotland===\nHe became a regular part of the Scotland team during the [[2012 Six Nations Championship|2012 Six Nations]], following [[Dan Parks]]' sudden retirement after the first round of the tournament.

He kicked a last-minute conversion against Italy to salvage something from an underwhelming tournament, giving Scotland a 30\u201329 victory. He continued to captain Edinburgh throughout the [[2013\u201314 Edinburgh Rugby season|2013\u201314 season]], missing out on a place in the [[Amlin Challenge Cup]] on points difference. Laidlaw was also named as the captain of Scotland internationally in 2013, and has since captained the country 39 times, the most of any Scottish player.\n\nLaidlaw missed the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]] due to injury, with flanker [[John Barclay (rugby union)|John Barclay]] standing in as captain during Laidlaw's absence. Laidlaw returned to Scotland for the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]], retaining his place as a regular starter under new coach [[Gregor Townsend]].\n\nWith injury to John Barclay, Laidlaw was re-instated as the Scottish Captain during the [[2018 end-of-year rugby union internationals]].\n\nAfter 7 years playing for and captaining the national side Laidlaw retired from international rugby in December 2019.

Laidlaw has scored over 700 points for Scotland in his career and is one of the highest points scorers in rugby union history.\n\n==Personal life==\nA nephew of Scotland scrum half [[Roy Laidlaw]],<ref name=\"Indep\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/greig-laidlaw-thirsty-for-more-heineken-8209757.html |title=Greig Laidlaw: Thirsty for more Heineken|first=Simon|last=Turnbull|date=13 October 2012|location=London|work=The Independent}}</ref> he joined [[Edinburgh Rugby|Edinburgh]] in the summer of 2006. His first-team opportunities were limited at first behind Scotland scrum half [[Mike Blair]], but in 2010 he signed a new two-year contract.\n\nHis earlier representative rugby included games for Borders under-16 and under-18 as well as Scotland under-18. After stints with the Scotland sevens and under-21 sides, he made his full Scotland debut against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] in November 2010. In January 2011, he was called up to Scotland's Six Nations squad and, although he did not get any game time, he was retained in Andy Robinson's 40-man squad ahead of the World Cup. He captained [[Scotland A national rugby union team|Scotland A]] to wins over the [[Ireland Wolfhounds]] and [[Italy A national rugby union team|Italy A]] in early 2011, and then skippered Edinburgh in the [[Pro14|Celtic League]].\n\n==Club career==\nOn 4 March 2014 it was announced that Laidlaw would depart Murrayfield at the end of the season and join [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] side [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12549/9195424/aviva-premiership-edinburgh-captain-greig-laidlaw-secures-gloucester-move|publisher=Sky Sports|title=Edinburgh and Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw seals Gloucester move|date=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter spending three seasons with English Premiership side Gloucester, Laidlaw would depart [[Kingsholm Stadium|Kingsholm]] at the end of 2016-17 season and join French [[Top 14]] side [[Clermont Auvergne]] on a three-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/confirmed-greig-laidlaw-leaving-gloucester-for-france/story-29801869-detail/story.html???#t7pJEZ5ymLMUYCEM.99|publisher=GloucestershireLive|title=Confirmed: Greig Laidlaw Leaving Gloucester Rugby for France|date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n\n===Scotland===\nHe became a regular part of the Scotland team during the [[2012 Six Nations Championship|2012 Six Nations]], following [[Dan Parks]]' sudden retirement after the first round of the tournament.

He kicked a last-minute conversion against Italy to salvage something from an underwhelming tournament, giving Scotland a 30\u201329 victory. He continued to captain Edinburgh throughout the [[2013\u201314 Edinburgh Rugby season|2013\u201314 season]], missing out on a place in the [[Amlin Challenge Cup]] on points difference. Laidlaw was also named as the captain of Scotland internationally in 2013, and has since captained the country 39 times, the most of any Scottish player.\n\nLaidlaw missed the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]] due to injury, with flanker [[John Barclay (rugby union)|John Barclay]] standing in as captain during Laidlaw's absence. Laidlaw returned to Scotland for the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]], retaining his place as a regular starter under new coach [[Gregor Townsend]].\n\nWith injury to John Barclay, Laidlaw was re-instated as the Scottish Captain during the [[2018 end-of-year rugby union internationals]].\n\nAfter 7 years playing for and captaining the national side Laidlaw retired from international rugby in December 2019.

Ginsburg was appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]] and took the oath of office on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice (after [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]) of four to be confirmed to the court (along with [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]], who are still serving). Following O'Connor's retirement, and until Sotomayor joined the court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, which were noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] wing of the court. Ginsburg has authored notable majority opinions, including ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', ''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]]'', and ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]''\n\nGinsburg was born in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother, one of her biggest sources of encouragement, died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She then earned her bachelor's degree at [[Cornell University]], and became a wife and mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to [[Columbia Law School]], where she graduated tied for first in her class. Following law school, Ginsburg turned to academia. She was a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]] and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\n\nGinsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of [[gender equality]] and [[women's rights]], winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer lawyer for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsels in the 1970s. In 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court. Ginsburg has received attention in American popular culture for her fiery liberal dissents and refusal to step down; she has been dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\" in reference to the late rapper known as \"[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-50388/|title=How Ruth Bader Ginsburg Became the 'Notorious RBG'|last=Kelley|first=Lauren|last2=Kelley|first2=Lauren|date=October 27, 2015|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073309/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-50388/|archive-date=January 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nJoan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]], the second daughter of Celia (n\u00e9e Amster) and Nathan Bader, who lived in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] neighborhood.

Ginsburg was appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]] and took the oath of office on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice (after [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]) of four to be confirmed to the court (along with [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]], who are still serving). Following O'Connor's retirement, and until Sotomayor joined the court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, which were noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] wing of the court. Ginsburg has authored notable majority opinions, including ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', ''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]]'', and ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]''\n\nGinsburg was born in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother, one of her biggest sources of encouragement, died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She then earned her bachelor's degree at [[Cornell University]], and became a wife and mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to [[Columbia Law School]], where she graduated tied for first in her class. Following law school, Ginsburg turned to academia. She was a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]] and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\n\nGinsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of [[gender equality]] and [[women's rights]], winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer lawyer for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsels in the 1970s. In 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court. Ginsburg has received attention in American popular culture for her fiery liberal dissents and refusal to step down; she has been dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\" in reference to the late rapper known as \"[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-50388/|title=How Ruth Bader Ginsburg Became the 'Notorious RBG'|last=Kelley|first=Lauren|last2=Kelley|first2=Lauren|date=October 27, 2015|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073309/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-50388/|archive-date=January 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nJoan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]], the second daughter of Celia (n\u00e9e Amster) and Nathan Bader, who lived in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] neighborhood.
