The chairwoman of the county commission, Yvonne Atkinson Gates, was against the annexation, but voted for annexation anyway because she wanted to recall the situation after the next advisory board meeting in January 1997.

The attendance of France was seen as problematic because the country quickly surrendered, established the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], rounded up and transported many thousands of its Jews to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and its role in the liberation of Europe was effectively limited to its own borders. By contrast, Polish uniformed forces under Allied command outnumbered those of France and indisputably helped liberate Europe. Polish forces included General Maczek\u2019s 1st Armored Division, General Anders\u2019s 2nd Army Corps, and General Berling\u2019s 1st Polish Army. In addition, Polish RAF squadrons under British command helped defeat Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe in the [[Battle of Britain]] while Poland\u2019s early [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] successes enabled the deciphering of German communications, which helped shorten the war. Poland was also the first to tell the West of Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Polish and European Jews. This information came directly from a Polish intelligence network in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] established by Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], who voluntarily infiltrated Auschwitz by walking into a German roundup and became Auschwitz inmate number 4859.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html|title=\u2018Were We All People?\u2019|date=2012-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nPresident Duda criticized the event\u2019s organizers for making Putin a featured speaker while ignoring the fact that, before the [[Soviet Union]] helped [[Eastern Front (World War II)|liberate Europe in 1945]], Soviet leader Stalin, together with Hitler, attacked Poland in 1939 to destroy the Polish state and annihilate its people on both sides of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line. This was confirmed during Putin\u2019s address to the Forum, which portrayed the Soviet Union\u2019s participation in the war as beginning in 1942 after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded it in 1941]]. The presentation did not show that the Soviet Union had occupied its half of Poland, as was agreed to in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe controversy began after Putin made a number of accusations, one of which was that Poland was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War II because of [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|Poland's participation]] in the annexation of parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Putin\u2019s anger stemmed from a [[European Parliament]] Resolution issued on the 19th September 2019 entitled \u201cImportance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\u201d. It blamed the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for [[Timeline of events preceding World War II|starting World War II]], and called for the removal of Soviet war memorials erected after 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |title=The End of Anti-Fascism |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/european-parliament-nazism-communism-russia-viktor-orban |work=Jacobin |date=September 2019}}</ref> The resolution condemns the Soviet Union and Germany for agreeing, via the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to start World War II by first jointly attacking Poland and then dividing Europe between them; all the while engaging in the mass murders of civilians. The Resolution further states that Russian authorities have denied responsibility for the Pact and its horrific consequences, and instead are promoting the view that Poland, the Baltic States, and the West are the true instigators of the war. Putin angrily dismissed the Resolution as \"sheer nonsense\u201d and suggested that Stalin was forced into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact after other European nations signed nonaggression agreements with Hitler. He further said the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], which allowed Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia, was an example of western \"collusion\" with Hitler.\n\nPresident [[Gitanas Naus\u0117da|Gitanas Nauseda]] of Lithuania endorsed President's Duda position and also withdrew from the summit.

The press release stated \u201c\u2026it is especially appropriate that the leaders addressing this event represent the four main powers of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], which liberated Europe and the world from the murderous tyranny of Nazi Germany.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-holocaust-memorial-set-to-begin-organizers-deny-event-becoming-politicized/|title=As Holocaust memorial begins, organizers deny event becoming politicized|last=Wootliff|first=Raoul|last2=Ahren|first2=Raphael|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>President Duda viewed the Yad Vashem explanation as invalid and believed Poland\u2019s right to address to the Forum was categorically appropriate for a number of reasons. The attendance of France was seen as problematic because the country quickly surrendered, established the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], rounded up and transported many thousands of its Jews to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and its role in the liberation of Europe was effectively limited to its own borders. By contrast, Polish uniformed forces under Allied command outnumbered those of France and indisputably helped liberate Europe. Polish forces included General Maczek\u2019s 1st Armored Division, General Anders\u2019s 2nd Army Corps, and General Berling\u2019s 1st Polish Army. In addition, Polish RAF squadrons under British command helped defeat Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe in the [[Battle of Britain]] while Poland\u2019s early [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] successes enabled the deciphering of German communications, which helped shorten the war. Poland was also the first to tell the West of Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Polish and European Jews. This information came directly from a Polish intelligence network in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] established by Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], who voluntarily infiltrated Auschwitz by walking into a German roundup and became Auschwitz inmate number 4859.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html|title=\u2018Were We All People?\u2019|date=2012-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nPresident Duda criticized the event\u2019s organizers for making Putin a featured speaker while ignoring the fact that, before the [[Soviet Union]] helped [[Eastern Front (World War II)|liberate Europe in 1945]], Soviet leader Stalin, together with Hitler, attacked Poland in 1939 to destroy the Polish state and annihilate its people on both sides of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line. This was confirmed during Putin\u2019s address to the Forum, which portrayed the Soviet Union\u2019s participation in the war as beginning in 1942 after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded it in 1941]]. The presentation did not show that the Soviet Union had occupied its half of Poland, as was agreed to in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe controversy began after Putin made a number of accusations, one of which was that Poland was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War II because of [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|Poland's participation]] in the annexation of parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Putin\u2019s anger stemmed from a [[European Parliament]] Resolution issued on 19 September 2019 entitled \u201cImportance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\u201d. It blamed the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for [[Timeline of events preceding World War II|starting World War II]], and called for the removal of Soviet war memorials erected after 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |title=The End of Anti-Fascism |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/european-parliament-nazism-communism-russia-viktor-orban |work=Jacobin |date=September 2019}}</ref> The resolution condemns the Soviet Union and Germany for agreeing, via the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to start World War II by first jointly attacking Poland and then dividing Europe between them, all the while engaging in the mass murders of civilians. The Resolution further states that Russian authorities have denied responsibility for the Pact and its horrific consequences, and instead are promoting the view that Poland, the Baltic States, and the West are the true instigators of the war. Putin angrily dismissed the Resolution as \"sheer nonsense\u201d and suggested that Stalin was forced into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact after other European nations signed nonaggression agreements with Hitler. He further said the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], which allowed Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia, was an example of western \"collusion\" with Hitler.\n\nPresident [[Gitanas Naus\u0117da|Gitanas Nauseda]] of Lithuania endorsed President's Duda position and also withdrew from the summit.

Although there are a few variations with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing skyward. \n\nThe dish is traditionally held to have originated from the village of [[Mousehole]] in [[Cornwall]] and is traditionally eaten during the festival of [[Tom Bawcock's Eve]] to celebrate his heroic catch during a very stormy winter. According to the modern festival, which is combined with the Mousehole village illuminations, the entire catch was baked into a huge stargazy pie, encompassing seven types of fish and saving the village from starvation. The story of Bawcock was popularised by [[Antonia Barber]]'s children's book ''[[The Mousehole Cat]]'', which featured the stargazy pie.

The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning that none of the fishing boats had been able to leave the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, were facing starvation.<ref name=\"BBC Tom\">{{cite news|title=The Story of Tom Bawcock|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cornwall/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8390000/8390344.stm|accessdate=7 January 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=2 December 2009}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn 23 December, Tom Bawcock decided to brave the storms and went out in his fishing boat. Despite the stormy weather and the difficult seas, he managed to catch enough fish to feed the entire village. The entire catch (including seven types of fish) was baked into a pie, which had the fish heads poking through to prove that there were fish inside. Ever since then, the [[Tom Bawcock's Eve]] festival is held on 23 December in Mousehole.

Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish [[Yarg]] cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.<ref name=\"ship chef\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Stargazy pie|url=http://www.itv.com/lifestyle/food/britainsbestdish/recipes2009/stargazypie/default.html|work=[[Britain's Best Dish]]|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe children's book ''[[The Mousehole Cat]]'' by [[Antonia Barber]] is inspired by Tom Bawcock's Eve. It is the story of Tom Bawcock and his loyal black and white cat, Mowzer, setting sail to catch the fish. When the boat hits the storm, it is represented by a giant \"Storm-Cat\", allowing Mowzer to eventually save the day by soothing the storm with her purring. This purring becomes a song and while the Storm-Cat is resting Tom is able to haul in his catch and return to the village. When they arrive back at the village, the entire catch is baked into a \"Star-Gazy\" pie, on which the villagers feast.\n\nThe main course of the second series of the ''[[Great British Menu]]'' was won by [[Mark Hix]], head chef at [[The Ivy]] in London, with a variation on stargazy pie,<ref name=\"hix\">{{cite news|last=Stacey|first=Caroline|title=Mark Hix serves up a seasonal feast|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article4919532.ece|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=11 October 2008}}</ref> which combined rabbit and [[crayfish]] for the filling, poking some crayfish through the pie crust.

The history of XIV Corps in [[World War II]] dates from December 1942. Then, under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Alexander Patch]], the XIV Army Corps directed the American [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd Infantry Division]] and [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]]s, the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], and the [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry Regimental Combat Team]] in the final drive that expelled the Japanese from [[Guadalcanal]] early in February 1943. The [[562nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|70th Coast Artillery Regiment (Anti-Aircraft)]] landed on 23 May 1943. From air fields guarded by the XIV Army Corps, Allied aircraft began the neutralization of the enemy's vital Munda airfields on [[New Georgia]].\n\nMajor General [[Oscar Griswold]] succeeded Patch as XIV Corps commander on 26 April 1943. In a lightning campaign, which began 30 June 1943 with the invasion of [[Rendova Islands]], General Griswold's forces, which included the [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd (New England)]] and the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th (Buckeye) Infantry Division]]s with elements of the 25th Division, seized New Georgia and the important Munda airfield on 6 August. Mopping up the adjacent islands was completed and the New Georgia campaign ended on 6 October 1943. American and New Zealand aircraft operating from the Munda field began the neutralization of Kahili and other enemy airfields in [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].\n\nXIV Corps defeated the once fine [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|Japanese 17th Army]] on Bougainville in March 1944. Part of this army was the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Sixth Infantry Division]], which was considered Japan's best division in the early Chinese campaigns and played a major part in the Rape of the Chinese city of [[Nanking]] in 1937.\n\nIn the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)]], the 37th and Americal Divisions, and two battalions of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Fiji military forces]], were the principal combat units of XIV Corps. Elements of the [[US 93rd Infantry Division|93rd (Negro) Infantry Division]] arrived after the peak of the battle and assisted in harassing retreating Japanese troops. There were 65,000 Japanese on Bougainville when the Americans landed, of whom some 8,200 died in combat and 16,600 from illness.<ref>Long, ''The Final Campaigns'', pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe three airfields in the Bougainville perimeter were used as bases for allied aircraft that reduced the once mighty Japanese air and naval base of [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]], to an impotent outpost of the enemy's island empire. The first raid on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], a large Japanese air and naval base in the Central Pacific, was staged through Bougainville by [[B-24 Liberator|Liberators]] of the [[Thirteenth Air Force]].\n\nFrom the Solomons campaigns, XIV Army Corps gained the nickname \"Kings of the Solomons\".\n\n==Liberators of Manila==\n\nXIV Army Corps with its initial divisions, the 37th and the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th (Sunshine) Infantry Division]], landed on the shores of [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Luzon]], Philippines, on S-Day, which was 9 January 1945. The landing was made without ground opposition as the Japanese garrison, completely surprised, fled three days before S-Day at the start of an intensive naval and aerial bombardment.\n\nMeeting sporadic resistance, the corps drove rapidly south towards [[Manila]], capturing successively [[Binmaley]], [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]], [[Malasiqui]] and [[Tarlac]]. At Bamban, the enemy was strongly entrenched in the 40th's sector in the foothills of the [[Zambales Mountains]]. Attacking abreast, the 37th and 40th sufficiently reduced the resistance to allow the 37th to continue on to Manila. The 40th was left to contain and exterminate the stubbornly resisting Japanese.\n\nThe [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] from Guimba began a drive to Manila overrunning the towns of [[Cabanatuan]], [[Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija|Santa Rosa]] and [[Garapan]], and by 1 February 1945, the 37th and the 1st Cavalry were poised north of Manila ready for the battle for the Philippines' capital city.\n\nOn 2 February, elements of the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]] made an airborne and amphibious invasion of Nasugbu on the west coast of Batangas Province, 32 miles southwest of the former American naval base of [[Cavite]]. This move was to seal off the Japanese forces south of Manila. The 11th, passing to XIV Corps control, began a push toward a junction with columns of the 37th and 1st Cavalry and support them by Filipino ground troops under the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and recognized [[guerrilla]] groups.\n\nOn 3 February, the 1st Cavalry entered Manila liberating 3,700 American internees at Santo Tomas and the next day soldiers of the 37th marched into [[Bilibid Prison]] freeing 800 American civilians and soldiers captured on [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]] in 1941.\n\nResistance was quickly reduced north of the [[Pasig River]], but the Japanese fought ferociously in Southern Manila. American Forces of the 37th, 1st Cavalry and 11th Airborne and Filipino forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units and local guerrilla fighters joined up in Manila on 13 February. Meanwhile, the [[6th Infantry Division (United States)|6th (Red Star) Infantry Division]] joined XIV Corps on 17 February and attacked well fortified enemy forces in the Shimbu Line east of Manila. In an amphibious, air, para-troop, ground assault, elements of the 11th Airborne Division aided by elements of XIV Corps Special Troops, freed 2,100 American internees from [[Los Banos Prison Camp]], 23 February.\n\nMain enemy resistance collapsed with the taking of the ancient walled city of [[Intramuros]] on 24 February by the U.S. 37th Division and aiding Philippine Commonwealth Army units and recognized guerrillas. Mopping up was completed in three public building that had been fortified by the Japanese and in [[Manila Bay]], where Japanese has set up defenses in the hulks of sunken ships.\n\nThe cleanup of Southern Luzon with the 1st Cavalry and the 11th Airborne comprising major corps units was begun 15 March, and by 20 May the area was declared free of Japanese organized resistance. Then on 1 July, the corps with the 6th, [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd (Red Arrow)]], 37th and [[38th Infantry Division (United States)|38th (Cyclone) Division]] began the cleanup of Northern Luzon.\n\n==Campaign credits and postwar service==\n\nXIV Corps is credited with service in the Guadalcanal, Northern Solomons, Bismarck Archipelago, and Luzon Campaigns. Subsequent to World War II, XIV Corps was active in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], from 1957 to 1968.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Wilson, John B., compiler (1999). \"Armies, Corps, Divisions, and Separate Brigades\".
