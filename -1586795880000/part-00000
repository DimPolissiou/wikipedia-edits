It can also be used for [[fax]] communication over IP networks (as defined in [[T.38]] specification). G.711 is a [[narrowband]] audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300\u20133400&nbsp;Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: [[\u03bc-law]], which is used primarily in North America and Japan, and [[A-law]], which is in use in most other countries outside North America.\n\n==Enhancements==\nTwo enhancements to G.711 have been published: '''G.711.0''' utilizes [[lossless data compression]] to reduce the bandwidth usage and '''G.711.1''' increases audio quality by increasing bandwidth.\n\n==Features==\n* Sampling frequency 8&nbsp;kHz\n* 64 kbit/s bitrate (8&nbsp;kHz sampling frequency \u00d7 8 bits per sample)\n* Typical algorithmic delay is 0.125 ms, with no look-ahead delay\n* G.711 is a [[waveform]] [[speech coder]]\n* G.711 Appendix I defines a [[packet loss concealment]] (PLC) algorithm to help hide transmission losses in a packetized network\n* G.711 Appendix II defines a [[discontinuous transmission]] (DTX) algorithm which uses [[voice activity detection]] (VAD) and [[Comfort noise|comfort noise generation]] (CNG) to reduce bandwidth usage during silence periods\n* [[PSQM]] testing under ideal conditions yields [[mean opinion score]]s of 4.45 for G.711 \u03bc-law, 4.45 for G.711 A-law\n* PSQM testing under network stress yields [[mean opinion score]]s of 4.13 for G.711 \u03bc-law, 4.11 for G.711 A-law\n\n==Types==\nG.711 defines two main [[companding]] algorithms, the [[\u03bc-law algorithm]] and [[A-law algorithm]]. Both are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], but A-law was specifically designed to be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power level of 0 [[Decibel|dB]].\n\nThe \u03bc-law and A-law algorithms encode 14-bit and 13-bit signed linear PCM samples (respectively) to logarithmic 8-bit samples. Thus, the G.711 [[data compression|encoder]] will create a 64 kbit/s bitstream for a signal sampled at 8&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nG.711 \u03bc-law tends to give more resolution to higher range signals while G.711 A-law provides more quantization levels at lower signal levels.\n\n=== A-law ===\n{{Main|A-law algorithm}}\nA-law encoding thus takes a 13-bit signed linear audio sample as input and converts it to an 8 bit value as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Note that the first column of the table uses different representation of negative values than the third column. So for example, input decimal value \u221221 is represented in binary after bit inversion as 1000000010100, which maps to 00001010 (according to the first row of the table). When decoding, this maps back to 1000000010101, which is interpreted as output value \u221221 in decimal. Input value +52 (0000000110100 in binary) maps to 10011010 (according to the second row), which maps back to 0000000110101 (+53 in decimal).\n\nThis can be seen as a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] number with 4 bits of [[Significand|mantissa]] {{var|m}} (equivalent to a 5-bit precision), 3 bits of [[exponent]] {{var|e}} and 1 sign bit {{var|s}}, formatted as <code>{{overline|s}}eeemmmm</code> with the decoded linear value {{var|y}} given by formula\n:<math>y = (-1)^s \\cdot (16 \\cdot \\min \\{ e, 1 \\} + m + 0.5) \\cdot 2^{\\max \\{ e, 1 \\} },</math>\nwhich is a 13-bit signed integer in the range \u00b11 to \u00b1(2{{sup|12}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2{{sup|6}}). Note that no compressed code decodes to zero due to the addition of 0.5 (half of a quantization step).\n\nIn addition, the standard specifies that all resulting even bits ([[least significant bit|LSB]] is even) are inverted before the octet is transmitted. This is to provide plenty of 0/1 transitions to facilitate the [[clock recovery]] process in the PCM receivers. Thus, a silent A-law encoded PCM channel has the 8 bit samples coded 0xD5 instead of 0x80 in the octets.\n\nWhen data is sent over E0 ([[G.703]]), MSB (sign) is sent first and LSB is sent last.\n\nITU-T STL<ref>[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.191-201003-I/en G.191 : Software tools for speech and audio coding standardization].

It can also be used for [[fax]] communication over IP networks (as defined in [[T.38]] specification). G.711 is a [[narrowband]] audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300\u20133400&nbsp;Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: [[\u03bc-law]], which is used primarily in North America and Japan, and [[A-law]], which is in use in most other countries outside North America.\n\n==Enhancements==\nTwo enhancements to G.711 have been published: '''G.711.0''' utilizes [[lossless data compression]] to reduce the bandwidth usage and '''G.711.1''' increases audio quality by increasing bandwidth.\n\n==Features==\n* Sampling frequency 8&nbsp;kHz\n* 64 kbit/s bitrate (8&nbsp;kHz sampling frequency \u00d7 8 bits per sample)\n* Typical algorithmic delay is 0.125 ms, with no look-ahead delay\n* G.711 is a [[waveform]] [[speech coder]]\n* G.711 Appendix I defines a [[packet loss concealment]] (PLC) algorithm to help hide transmission losses in a packetized network\n* G.711 Appendix II defines a [[discontinuous transmission]] (DTX) algorithm which uses [[voice activity detection]] (VAD) and [[Comfort noise|comfort noise generation]] (CNG) to reduce bandwidth usage during silence periods\n* [[PSQM]] testing under ideal conditions yields [[mean opinion score]]s of 4.45 for G.711 \u03bc-law, 4.45 for G.711 A-law\n* [[PSQM]] testing under network stress yields [[mean opinion score]]s of 4.13 for G.711 \u03bc-law, 4.11 for G.711 A-law\n\n==Types==\nG.711 defines two main [[companding]] algorithms, the [[\u03bc-law algorithm]] and [[A-law algorithm]]. Both are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], but A-law was specifically designed to be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power level of 0 [[Decibel|dB]].\n\nThe \u03bc-law and A-law algorithms encode 14-bit and 13-bit signed linear PCM samples (respectively) to logarithmic 8-bit samples. Thus, the G.711 [[data compression|encoder]] will create a 64 kbit/s bitstream for a signal sampled at 8&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nG.711 \u03bc-law tends to give more resolution to higher range signals while G.711 A-law provides more quantization levels at lower signal levels.\n\n=== A-law ===\n{{Main|A-law algorithm}}\nA-law encoding thus takes a 13-bit signed linear audio sample as input and converts it to an 8 bit value as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Note that the first column of the table uses different representation of negative values than the third column. So for example, input decimal value \u221221 is represented in binary after bit inversion as 1000000010100, which maps to 00001010 (according to the first row of the table). When decoding, this maps back to 1000000010101, which is interpreted as output value \u221221 in decimal. Input value +52 (0000000110100 in binary) maps to 10011010 (according to the second row), which maps back to 0000000110101 (+53 in decimal).\n\nThis can be seen as a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] number with 4 bits of [[Significand|mantissa]] {{var|m}} (equivalent to a 5-bit precision), 3 bits of [[exponent]] {{var|e}} and 1 sign bit {{var|s}}, formatted as <code>{{overline|s}}eeemmmm</code> with the decoded linear value {{var|y}} given by formula\n:<math>y = (-1)^s \\cdot (16 \\cdot \\min \\{ e, 1 \\} + m + 0.5) \\cdot 2^{\\max \\{ e, 1 \\} },</math>\nwhich is a 13-bit signed integer in the range \u00b11 to \u00b1(2{{sup|12}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2{{sup|6}}). Note that no compressed code decodes to zero due to the addition of 0.5 (half of a quantization step).\n\nIn addition, the standard specifies that all resulting even bits ([[least significant bit|LSB]] is even) are inverted before the octet is transmitted. This is to provide plenty of 0/1 transitions to facilitate the [[clock recovery]] process in the PCM receivers. Thus, a silent A-law encoded PCM channel has the 8 bit samples coded 0xD5 instead of 0x80 in the octets.\n\nWhen data is sent over E0 ([[G.703]]), MSB (sign) is sent first and LSB is sent last.\n\nITU-T STL<ref>[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.191-201003-I/en G.191 : Software tools for speech and audio coding standardization].

The three G.711.1 layers are: log companded pulse code modulation (PCM) of the lower band including noise feedback, embedded PCM extension with adaptive bit allocation for enhancing the quality of the base layer in the lower band, and weighted vector quantization coding of the higher band based on [[modified discrete cosine transform]]ation (MDCT).<ref name=\"g711-4\" />\n\nTwo extensions for G.711.1 are planned in 2010: superwideband extension (bandwidth to 14000&nbsp;Hz) and lossless bitstream compression.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ficora.fi/attachments/suomiry/5lN8SYM14/Stand09-Hagqvist.pdf |title=Coding standards |author=Nokia Research Center |date=2009-04-06 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref>\n\n== Licensing ==\nSince G.711 was released in 1972 its patents have long since expired, so it is freely available.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of codecs]]\n*[[Comparison of audio coding formats]]\n*[[RTP audio video profile]]\n*[[Au file format]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.711 ITU-T Recommendation G.711]\n* [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.191 ITU-T G.191 software tools for speech and audio coding, including G.711 C code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060720180425/http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/g711audio.asp Code Project C# implementation of G.711 with source code]\n* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3551#page-28 RFC 3551 - RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control] - G.711 - PCMA and PCMU definition.\n* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4856#page-21 RFC 4856 - Registration of Media Type audio/PCMA and audio/PCMU]\n* RFC 5391 - RTP Payload Format for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.1 (PCMA-WB and PCMU-WB)\n\n{{Compression formats}}\n\n[[Category:Audio codecs]]\n[[Category:Speech codecs]]\n[[Category:ITU-T recommendations]]\n[[Category:ITU-T G Series Recommendations]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1972]]\n", "name_user": "Kvng", "label": "safe", "comment": "rm rep link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711"}

Centrally planned building programmes included large estates, carefully connected by new road networks, of commercial and residential use by [[Hampshire County Council]]'s architects, led by [[Colin Stansfield Smith]].

Centrally planned building programmes included large estates, carefully connected by new road networks, of commercial and residential use by [[Hampshire County Council]]'s architects, led by [[Colin Stansfield Smith]].

Now, the club is well known and supported by the country and its citizen, especially the Felda generations.\n\n=== The Club's Tracks ===\nThe club has been one of the more consistent teams in the 2007 [[Malaysian FAM Cup]] after placing third, despite their fresh appearance in the industry. The club was promoted into the [[Malaysia Premier League|Premier League]] from the [[Malaysian FAM Cup]] in 2008 after only one season in the Malaysian Football League.

After playing consistently in the Super League for 3 seasons, the team had a downfall where they were back in the Premier League for 2014. However, it was not the end for The Fighters as they were placed second in Premier League, promoting them back into Super League for 2015, 2016 and 2017. 2018 came with sorrow as the club was again, demoted into the Premier League as the [[Football Association of Malaysia]] (FAM) denied their club license as they failed to submit some documents.<ref>[https://www.nst.com.my/sports/football/2017/12/310622/felda-united-demoted-failing-comply-regulations Felda United Demoted for Failing to Comply with Regulations] New Straits Times, 4 December 2017.

Lifetime images of Party members on stamps were used to emphasize the theme of state power. One of such examples was a 1935 set of stamps commemorating [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s 60th birthday and depicting him as a worker, a farmer, and an orator. These Kalinin stamps illustrated the motive powers of the [[Soviet state]]: the worker, the farmer, and the Communist Party. Such a practice is considered a worldwide trend when in-power politicians are shown on postage stamps symbolizing the state.<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page41.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1935.

Earlier stamp themes in the 1920s reflected, though indirectly, the spirit of [[New Economic Policy]]. Since 1929, stamps had been used for a clear declaration of the changed economic policies. When [[Joseph Stalin]] initiated [[industrialisation]], a special set of stamps was issued to support this effort. For example, the 10-kopecks stamp showed a series of tractors, saying \"Let us increase the harvest by 35%\". An inscription on the 20-kopecks stamp called for \"More metal, more machines!\". The 28-kopecks stamp pictured a blast furnace, a chart for iron-ore production and the slogan \"Iron, 8 million tons\".<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page35.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1929.

Party platforms with rather lengthy excerpts from Party documents and congresses' resolutions appeared on stamps at that time. Such was, for instance, the series of \"Decisions of the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\u2014into Life\" that was designed by V. Zavyalov and A. Shmidshtein, and issued in 1962.<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page68.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1962. November \u2013 December.

They were no longer brief imperative commands but rather promises and explanations by the Party to Soviet society. For example, on a 1971 [[souvenir sheet]] from the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th Party Congress]] series designed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yuri Levinovsky|WD=Q4256524|lt=Yu.

Lifetime images of Party members on stamps were used to emphasize the theme of state power. One of such examples was a 1935 set of stamps commemorating [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s 60th birthday and depicting him as a worker, a farmer, and an orator. These Kalinin stamps illustrated the motive powers of the [[Soviet state]]: the worker, the farmer, and the Communist Party. Such a practice is considered a worldwide trend when in-power politicians are shown on postage stamps symbolizing the state.<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page41.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1935.

Earlier stamp themes in the 1920s reflected, though indirectly, the spirit of [[New Economic Policy]]. Since 1929, stamps had been used for a clear declaration of the changed economic policies. When [[Joseph Stalin]] initiated [[industrialisation]], a special set of stamps was issued to support this effort. For example, the 10-kopecks stamp showed a series of tractors, saying \"Let us increase the harvest by 35%\". An inscription on the 20-kopecks stamp called for \"More metal, more machines!\". The 28-kopecks stamp pictured a blast furnace, a chart for iron-ore production and the slogan \"Iron, 8 million tons\".<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page35.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1929.

Party platforms with rather lengthy excerpts from Party documents and congresses' resolutions appeared on stamps at that time. Such was, for instance, the series of \"Decisions of the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\u2014into Life\" that was designed by V. Zavyalov and A. Shmidshtein, and issued in 1962.<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page68.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1962. November \u2013 December.

They were no longer brief imperative commands but rather promises and explanations by the Party to Soviet society. For example, on a 1971 [[souvenir sheet]] from the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th Party Congress]] series designed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yuri Levinovsky|WD=Q4256524|lt=Yu.
