Herman is riled by the anti-war rhetoric of populist aviator hero [[Charles Lindbergh]] with its [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, but does not take the possibility of his running for the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] seriously. Herman is offered a promotion, but this would require them to live in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]] where they would likely be the only Jews in the neighborhood. Disgusted by the patrons at a German-themed bar in Union, he decides to decline the offer. Alvin is fired from his job at a local [[Esso]] service station for stealing; he tells Sandy he took the blame for a friend. He moves out of the house after an argument with Herman. Bess's older sister Evelyn, who looks after their mother, is having an affair with a married man in New York; it soon becomes clear that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Philip's friend Earl, whose mother has a scandalous reputation, is a corrupting influence on him. Evelyn and Bess meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf, who is sympathetic to Lindbergh's anti-war message; Evelyn is charmed. Alvin secretly stays with a friend whose father runs a candy store. At night, he and two friends wait outside the German bar in Union and beat up two drunk patrons on their way home, calling them fascists.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Part 2\n |DirectedBy = Minkie Spiro\n |WrittenBy = David Simon & Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n |Viewers = 0.395<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = October 1940. Sandy eagerly attends a speech by Lindbergh, with Evelyn and Bengelsdorf present. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf later enter into a relationship, and Evelyn introduces him to her mother. Bengelsdorf assures Evelyn he will attempt to sway her family to his side politically. With Herman's assistance, Alvin takes a job as a driver for a wealthy man named Abe Steinheim, but quickly grows to find him crass and corrupt. To aid her family financially, Bess takes a retail job at an upper-class store, though she soon becomes unnerved by Lindbergh-supporting customers. Philip continues to learn delinquent behavior from Earl, including theft and following strangers around the city. Speaking at a Lindbergh rally, Bengelsdorf lavishly endorses Lindbergh, with Evelyn by his side. Disgusted by Bengelsdorf and the direction of the country, Alvin quits his job and enlists in the [[Canadian Army]].

A few months after Lindbergh's inauguration, anti-Semitic incidents have been rising in the United States. Lindbergh signs a neutrality agreement with [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also places Bengelsdorf in charge of a program called \"Just Folks,\" as part of the Office of American Absorption, which temporarily places Jewish boys into rural families to make them \"more American\"; Evelyn signs up Sandy to participate. Philip begins to have nightmares about Nazis. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Bess's mother's [[dementia]] has been worsening. As Bess's concern for her family's safety grows, she places them on a waiting list to potentially emigrate to Canada. The Levins take a trip to Washington, D.C., where they experience anti-Semitism among both citizens and the police. Herman ultimately gives his permission for Sandy to travel to Kentucky as part of Just Folks. Alvin flourishes in Canada's military program, and is recruited by British intelligence to help steal a German [[radar]] device.

Bess and Evelyn's mother passes away. Herman visits Alvin in the hospital and offers his support, but Alvin has grown aloof and disillusioned. Alvin is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], after which he is discharged and returns to New Jersey. In [[synagogue]], Sandy gives a presentation espousing Just Folks, after being designated a 'Recruitment Officer' by Evelyn. When Evelyn and Bengelsdorf join the Levins for [[Shabbat]], Herman clashes with Bengelsdorf's views and upbringing, including his father fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After Bengelsdorf proposes an expansion of Just Folks, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] invites him and Evelyn to a state dinner with [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (as all other Jewish representatives refused). Evelyn also secures an invitation for Sandy, which enrages Herman and Bess, who refuse to let Sandy attend. He responds by calling his parents \"ghetto Jews\" and \"worse than Hitler\". Evelyn dances with the German official at the dinner, which appears later on the [[newsreel]]s. The FBI, meanwhile, has been tracking Alvin after marking him a potential [[Communist]].  Earl leaves town to live with his grandmother after his mother is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Seldon's father dies. Philip, overwhelmed by everything happening around him, happily watches a Lindbergh newsreel, much to Herman's exasperation.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Part 5\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = 0.433<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-13-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.13.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 13, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = April 1942. The Levins are forcibly signed up, by Evelyn, to participate in Homestead 42, Bengelsdorf's Just Folks expansion that relocates entire Jewish families. Bengelsdorf informs Bess that their participation will convince the FBI to take some heat off of Alvin. Philip expresses curiosity and concern about a [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence in Kentucky, and angrily asks Evelyn why his neighbor Seldon Wishnow, and Seldon's widowed mother Selma, weren't relocated instead. Misinterpreting this as a desire to be with his friend, Evelyn signs them up as well. Despite FBI threats, Herman intends to sue the OAA, but learns the legal process will take at least a year; instead, he quits his job to avoid the Homestead 42 obligation. Philip is overwhelmed with guilt when he realizes that he was the cause of Seldon's relocation to Kentucky, where he will almost certainly be unhappy. The FBI resumes tailing Alvin. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf marry in an extravagant ceremony unattended by the Levins. Outspoken radio host [[Walter Winchell]] escalates his anti-Lindbergh rhetoric; Bengelsdorf quickly gets him fired. Winchell announces a presidential run and Herman attends his rally, but violent Lindbergh supporters attack the attendees as the police stand aside. When Herman returns home bloodied, Bess threatens to leave him and take the children to Canada if he continues his resistance.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Part 6\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = David Simon\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = 0.392<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-20-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.20.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 21, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = {{Plot|episode|date=April 2020}} September 1942. Violent anti-Semitic incidents escalate and spread throughout the country. Winchell is assassinated in [[Louisville]]. At his funeral, New York Mayor [[Fiorello la Guardia]] eulogizes him and denounces Lindbergh. Bengelsdorf urges the First Lady to convince Lindbergh to issue a statement, but Lindbergh's speech is short and makes no appeal to stop anti-Jewish violence. Billy Murphy, a fellow veteran from the Canadian Army, visits Alvin introducing him to a British agent who persuades Alvin to join a secretive [[anti-fascist]] group that wants to assassinate Lindbergh; Alvin's radar expertise is needed to track Lindbergh's plane. Lindbergh's [[Spirit of St. Louis|plane]] vanishes. German radio spreads [[propaganda]] of a Jewish conspiracy, claims that are taken up by Acting President Wheeler who declares [[martial law]] and order the arrests of prominent Jews including Bengelsdorf. The First Lady is detained in a psychiatric hospital. Concerned by reports from Kentucky, Bess attempts to contact Selma but is only able to reach a distraught Seldon, whose mother hasn't returned home. Herman and Sandy drive to Kentucky to pick up Seldon, and learn Selma has been murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They encounter more Klan members on the way back to New Jersey. A terrified Evelyn asks Bess for sanctuary, but Bess tells her to leave and never return. The First Lady, freed from hospital by her supporters, issues a statement calling for peace, the release of the Jewish detainees, and urges Congress to replace Wheeler and call an emergency Presidential election. Bengelsdorf returns to his synagogue, finding his congregation all but gone. His claims that Lindbergh's presidency and subsequent disappearance were the result of a German blackmail operation are dismissed with skepticism. Alvin visits the Levins with his fiancee, but gets into a fistfight with Herman over Alvin's apparent indifference to national events. In November, the emergency election is marred by irregularities with some FDR voters being turned away at the polls and uncounted ballots being burned. The series ends without the results being revealed.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nHBO announced on November 8, 2018, that it had ordered a six-episode miniseries based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' to be written by [[David Simon]] and [[Ed Burns]] and executive produced by Simon, Burns, Roth, alongside [[Joe Roth]], Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, [[Nina Noble]], [[Megan Ellison]], [[Sue Naegle]], Susan Goldberg, and Dennis Stratton.

Herman is riled by the anti-war rhetoric of populist aviator hero [[Charles Lindbergh]] with its [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, but does not take the possibility of his running for the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] seriously. Herman is offered a promotion, but this would require them to live in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]] where they would likely be the only Jews in the neighborhood. Disgusted by the patrons at a German-themed bar in Union, he decides to decline the offer. Alvin is fired from his job at a local [[Esso]] service station for stealing; he tells Sandy he took the blame for a friend. He moves out of the house after an argument with Herman. Bess's older sister Evelyn, who looks after their mother, is having an affair with a married man in New York; it soon becomes clear that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Philip's friend Earl, whose mother has a scandalous reputation, is a corrupting influence on him. Evelyn and Bess meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf, who is sympathetic to Lindbergh's anti-war message; Evelyn is charmed. Alvin secretly stays with a friend whose father runs a candy store. At night, he and two friends wait outside the German bar in Union and beat up two drunk patrons on their way home, calling them fascists.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Part 2\n |DirectedBy = Minkie Spiro\n |WrittenBy = David Simon & Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n |Viewers = 0.395<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = October 1940. Sandy eagerly attends a speech by Lindbergh, with Evelyn and Bengelsdorf present. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf later enter into a relationship, and Evelyn introduces him to her mother. Bengelsdorf assures Evelyn he will attempt to sway her family to his side politically. With Herman's assistance, Alvin takes a job as a driver for a wealthy man named Abe Steinheim, but quickly grows to find him crass and corrupt. To aid her family financially, Bess takes a retail job at an upper-class store, though she soon becomes unnerved by Lindbergh-supporting customers. Philip continues to learn delinquent behavior from Earl, including theft and following strangers around the city. Speaking at a Lindbergh rally, Bengelsdorf lavishly endorses Lindbergh, with Evelyn by his side. Disgusted by Bengelsdorf and the direction of the country, Alvin quits his job and enlists in the [[Canadian Army]].

A few months after Lindbergh's inauguration, anti-Semitic incidents have been rising in the United States. Lindbergh signs a neutrality agreement with [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also places Bengelsdorf in charge of a program called \"Just Folks,\" as part of the Office of American Absorption, which temporarily places Jewish boys into rural families to make them \"more American\"; Evelyn signs up Sandy to participate. Philip begins to have nightmares about Nazis. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Bess's mother's [[dementia]] has been worsening. As Bess's concern for her family's safety grows, she places them on a waiting list to potentially emigrate to Canada. The Levins take a trip to Washington, D.C., where they experience anti-Semitism among both citizens and the police. Herman ultimately gives his permission for Sandy to travel to Kentucky as part of Just Folks. Alvin flourishes in Canada's military program, and is recruited by British intelligence to help steal a German [[radar]] device.

Bess and Evelyn's mother passes away. Herman visits Alvin in the hospital and offers his support, but Alvin has grown aloof and disillusioned. Alvin is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], after which he is discharged and returns to New Jersey. In [[synagogue]], Sandy gives a presentation espousing Just Folks, after being designated a 'Recruitment Officer' by Evelyn. When Evelyn and Bengelsdorf join the Levins for [[Shabbat]], Herman clashes with Bengelsdorf's views and upbringing, including his father fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After Bengelsdorf proposes an expansion of Just Folks, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] invites him and Evelyn to a state dinner with [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (as all other Jewish representatives refused). Evelyn also secures an invitation for Sandy, which enrages Herman and Bess, who refuse to let Sandy attend. He responds by calling his parents \"ghetto Jews\" and \"worse than Hitler\". Evelyn dances with the German official at the dinner, which appears later on the [[newsreel]]s. The FBI, meanwhile, has been tracking Alvin after marking him a potential [[Communist]].  Earl leaves town to live with his grandmother after his mother is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Seldon's father dies. Philip, overwhelmed by everything happening around him, happily watches a Lindbergh newsreel, much to Herman's exasperation.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Part 5\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = 0.433<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-13-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.13.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 13, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = April 1942. The Levins are forcibly signed up, by Evelyn, to participate in Homestead 42, Bengelsdorf's Just Folks expansion that relocates entire Jewish families. Bengelsdorf informs Bess that their participation will convince the FBI to take some heat off of Alvin. Philip expresses curiosity and concern about a [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence in Kentucky, and angrily asks Evelyn why his neighbor Seldon Wishnow, and Seldon's widowed mother Selma, weren't relocated instead. Misinterpreting this as a desire to be with his friend, Evelyn signs them up as well. Despite FBI threats, Herman intends to sue the OAA, but learns the legal process will take at least a year; instead, he quits his job to avoid the Homestead 42 obligation. Philip is overwhelmed with guilt when he realizes that he was the cause of Seldon's relocation to Kentucky, where he will almost certainly be unhappy. The FBI resumes tailing Alvin. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf marry in an extravagant ceremony unattended by the Levins. Outspoken radio host [[Walter Winchell]] escalates his anti-Lindbergh rhetoric; Bengelsdorf quickly gets him fired. Winchell announces a presidential run and Herman attends his rally, but violent Lindbergh supporters attack the attendees as the police stand aside.

Violent anti-Semitic incidents escalate and spread throughout the country. Winchell is assassinated in [[Louisville]]. At his funeral, New York Mayor [[Fiorello la Guardia]] eulogizes him and denounces Lindbergh. Bengelsdorf urges the First Lady to convince Lindbergh to issue a statement, but Lindbergh's speech is short and makes no appeal to stop anti-Jewish violence. Billy Murphy, a fellow veteran from the Canadian Army, visits Alvin introducing him to a British agent who persuades Alvin to join a secretive [[anti-fascist]] group that wants to assassinate Lindbergh; Alvin's radar expertise is needed to track Lindbergh's plane. Lindbergh's [[Spirit of St. Louis|plane]] vanishes. German radio spreads [[propaganda]] of a Jewish conspiracy, claims that are taken up by Acting President Wheeler who declares [[martial law]] and order the arrests of prominent Jews including Bengelsdorf. The First Lady is detained in a psychiatric hospital. Concerned by reports from Kentucky, Bess attempts to contact Selma but is only able to reach a distraught Seldon, whose mother hasn't returned home. Herman and Sandy drive to Kentucky to pick up Seldon, and learn Selma has been murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They encounter more Klan members on the way back to New Jersey. A terrified Evelyn asks Bess for sanctuary, but Bess tells her to leave and never return. The First Lady, freed from hospital by her supporters, issues a statement calling for peace, the release of the Jewish detainees, and urges Congress to replace Wheeler and call an emergency Presidential election. Bengelsdorf returns to his synagogue, finding his congregation all but gone. His claims that Lindbergh's presidency and subsequent disappearance were the result of a German blackmail operation are dismissed with skepticism. Alvin visits the Levins with his fiancee, but gets into a fistfight with Herman over Alvin's apparent indifference to national events. In November, the emergency election is marred by irregularities with some FDR voters being turned away at the polls and uncounted ballots being burned. The series ends without the results being revealed.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nHBO announced on November 8, 2018, that it had ordered a six-episode miniseries based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' to be written by [[David Simon]] and [[Ed Burns]] and executive produced by Simon, Burns, Roth, alongside [[Joe Roth]], Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, [[Nina Noble]], [[Megan Ellison]], [[Sue Naegle]], Susan Goldberg, and Dennis Stratton.
