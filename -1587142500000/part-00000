{"title_page": "Monasteries in Spain", "text_new": "'''Monasteries in Spain''' have a rich artistic and cultural tradition, and serve as testament to Spain's [[religious history]] and [[political history|political]]-[[military history]], from the [[Visigoths|Visigothic Period]] to the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Monastery|monasteries]] played an important role in the recruitment conducted by Christian aristocracy during and after the progress of the [[Reconquista]], with the consequent decline in the [[Muslim Spain|Muslim south]] of the [[peninsula]].\n\nTheir presence in the peninsula dates from the early centuries of [[Christianity]], when the original [[hermit]] life gave rise to the formation of religious communities and the construction of small monasteries by Hispanics in the sixth and seventh centuries. Many of these buildings reflect the traditional style of [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]].\n\nThe second phase was developed with the arrival of the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictines]] of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], during the Reconquista and several new orders developed at this time: [[Cistercians|Cistercian]], [[Military order (society)|military order]]s, [[Premonstratensian]], [[Carthusian monastery|Carthusians]], Jeromes, [[Augustinians]], [[Camaldolese]] and beggars.\n\nMonastic communities of various sizes sprang up from [[Catalonia]] to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]; some of these structures remain while others were abandoned or destroyed. Most of the monasteries in [[Spain]] are distributed in the northern half in line with the historical discourse of the zone in the Middle Ages. Monasteries are much less numerous in the south, [[Andalusia]] and the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nThe establishment of monasteries during the Middle Ages was paramount from a social and cultural standpoint, benefiting the arts and [[agriculture]].\n\nThe [[Camino de Santiago]] proved an important factor in locations of these monastic orders, as often an important objective was to support the [[pilgrim]]s traveling along this route.\n\n==Characteristics and evolution of the monastery in Spain==\n\nThe first reference to a monastery in Spain was in a letter from [[Saint Augustine|St. Augustine]] to the [[abbot]] of the Monastery of [[Cabrera, Balearic Islands|Cabrera]], written in 398. In 410, the monk Baquiario first used the term ''monastery'' in a text written in [[Hispania]]. He, as a [[monk]], and [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]], and the [[nun]] Etheria, perhaps more properly a [[consecrated virgin]], were the first such members of religious houses whose names are known.\n\nThe first monasteries arose in the fourth century and were humble buildings erected in the shadow of shrines dedicated to or graves of beloved local [[martyr]]s. Many of these monastic people were troglodytes, or cave dwellers, as hermits or recluses who served as models for later monastic culture preferred to live in caves equipped to be shelters or shrines. Such is the origin of the monastery of [[San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla]], which preserves as a shrine the cave where [[Saint Aemilianus|Aemilianus]], also known as Mill\u00e1n, lived. The caves served as dwellings for disciples of this saint. The practice of living apart from the world was transformed by monks belonging to monasteries; although they lived in communities, the individuals within the community maintained their [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice, living in a remote location, often in the desert.\n\nThe quantitative success of [[monasticism]] in the Visigothic period led to clashes with the secular clergy, and they brought this dispute to the [[Councils of Toledo]]. Much of this conflict derived from the social and economic benefits that were accorded as privileges of the monastic life. In some cases, as in the area of [[El Bierzo]], monasteries, such as [[Compludo]] and Ruphianensi Monasterium, accepted whole families. Others which served as foundations of [[Fructuosus of Braga]] had the appearance of real villages. In other areas, such as Andalusia, monasteries were segregated by gender. Some sources also attributed more extreme features of the hermit movement, such as social protest, to the more extreme features of the hermit movement, especially in areas such as [[Burgos (province)|Burgos]], [[\u00c1lava]] and [[Logro\u00f1o]]. This is in parallel with other religious movements as [[Priscillianism|heresy Priscillianist]], which survived in Galicia and other areas into the sixth century.\n\nIn the following centuries, Hispanic monasteries emerged and expanded, developing their own set of similar characteristics, with a purely Hispanic artistic style. With the arrival of the monks of Cluny in the eleventh century, and the [[Order of Saint Benedict|order of St. Benedict]] and observers of their rule, the Spanish monastery complex took on new importance and influence. This is the era of quintessential monastic life and notable edifices. Many of these clusters of buildings have survived to the modern era in various states of repair, although many are now used for purposes unrelated to monasticism. The political role of Cluny and its link with the [[monarchy]] and noble houses was decisive in the [[Europeanization]] of the Christian kingdoms of the mainland and the formation of [[feudal society]] in Spain.\n\nWith regard to the social and economic role of the Benedictine monasteries, the classic materialistic interpretations\u2014that of a feudal lord overseeing and creating the monastery\u2014are tempered by recent [[historiography]]. This study includes other aspects of the communities, such as inclusion in legal and sociological networks, using the methodology of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[microhistory]].\n\nFollowing the momentum of Cluny, Cistercians arrived with new works and reforms, followed by the Carthusians. In the thirteenth century the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], Premonstratensian and [[Jesuit]]s, arrived. Some of these groups have remained quite monastic. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, numerous monasteries and convents arose, such as the Monastery of the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos|Valley of the Fallen]].\n\nRecent monasteries founded and built in Spain were:\n\n*Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Viaceli (C\u00f3breces, [[Cantabria]]), promoted and sponsored by the brothers Manuel and Antonio Bernaldo de Quir\u00f3s and Pomar and Cistercian foundation in 1909\n*Convent of San Lorenzo in [[O\u00f1ati]], [[Guipuzcoa]], in 1928\n*Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen (Abbey of the Holy Cross in the Valley of the Fallen), 1940\u20131958, under draft Pedro Muguruza and Diego Mendez.\n*House of Spirituality of the Dominican Fathers ([[Caleruega]], Burgos), 1952 .\n*Roll Monastery (or Monastery of the Immaculate Conception ) in [[Salamanca]] 1961, created by the architect Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Alba .\n*Monasterio de Santa Maria de las Shallots ([[Hornachuelos]], [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish province)|C\u00f3rdoba]]), 1986\n\n===Foundations===\n\nMonasteries in this area were historically founded mainly by [[king]]s, [[bishop]]s and [[Nobility|nobles]]. There were a number of reasons individuals might found a monastery, largely self-serving ones: to reserve a [[burial]] there, which came with perpetual prayers by the monks on behalf of the founder's soul, sheltering a [[princess]], [[widow]], unmarried or [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]], in the case of kings. Sometimes there were political reasons for founding or protection of a particular monastery; many of the religious houses who protected were located in border areas where battles often raged, such as [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] or [[Navarre]], as was the case Matallana monastery (in the [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), or Bujedo-Navarre. Bishops had an interest in building a monastery on which to exercise their authority, especially in the feudal period, as this guaranteed an income. The nobility desired salvation for themselves and his family, plus a demonstration of political influence through sponsoring one of these great works. The [[monastic vows]] ([[poverty, chastity and obedience]]) were considered an appropriate vocation for younger sons, regardless of the sincerity or otherwise of his [[vocation]], in order to reduce the likelihood of disputes over the inheritance of the firstborn, who would then hold undivided estates according to the institution of [[primogeniture]]. This close identification between the clergy and nobility, both privileged classes, survived as an enduring connection during the Middle Ages and the [[Modern Age]] to the end of the ancien regime.\n\nOther monasteries arose without intervention from the above-mentioned members of society, when a community formed around a shrine. This is the case of the monastery of [[San Juan de Ortega]] which originally was a humble chapel founded by the saint to preserve relics of [[St. Nicholas of Bari]] Over time, sufficient people arrived to care for the shrine to require the formation of an official community. Or from hermits, in some cases doubling, that were left to be guided by any rule, as the [[Monastery of Santa Maria de Vallbona|Royal Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Vallbona]] ([[Vallbona de les Monges]]), the monastery of Santo Domingo de Oca\u00f1a ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) of the sixteenth century has the distinction of being founded by a neighbor who wanted to be close to the preachers.\n\nThere are recent foundations, of the twentieth century, whose intent is very clear from the outset, as is the spiritual community of the Dominican Fathers of Caleruega (Burgos), in 1952, destined for the convent-school-house of spirituality. The Monastery of Our Lady of the Angels of [[Palma de Mallorca]], in 1914, can be included as a religious house of education, as it was conceived as a major [[seminary]], Novitiate House, Ecumenical Centre College and routinely providing Evangelical Protestants Lutheran Germans.\n\n===The first Hispanic monasteries===\n\nDuring the sixth and seventh centuries, the Hispanic Visigoth cultures are  evidenced in a wealth of monastic communities in which ancient tradition still flourished and where the monks themselves supported monastic rule by living it. Many monasteries arose in this period.\n\nSome sources consider the Monastery of St. Victorian of Asan (in [[Sobrarbe]], [[Huesca (province)|Huesca province]]) as the first monastery founded in Spain, but more likely, given the existence of references to previous monasteries, the first initiative for foundation of churches sprang from the Visigoth king [[Gesalec]] in 506. Other possible inspirations are attributed to [[Swabia]]ns in the northwest, with the activity of San Mart\u00edn de Dumio, from [[Pannonia]]. Other founding saints such as San Donato, came from Africa J\u00e1tiva. San Fructuoso de Braga founded the monastery of Compludo in the early seventh century and twenty other foundations from Galicia to Andalusia. During the same century, [[Saint Leander|San Leandro]] and his brother [[Saint Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore]] composed their own monastic rules.\n\nMorphologically, Hispanic monasteries are clearly distinguished by two concepts:\n*Enclosing the community, which is known by the name of claustra\n*[[Cloister]]ed units, called domus.\n\nThe cloister was an enclosure that isolated and protected the monastery and its residents, which is very important to the religious life being cultivated. In one chapter, the San Isidoro rule states:\n\"The [[mill (grinding)|mill]] of the monastery on its premises only have one door and one [[Wicket gate|wicket]] to leave the garden.\"\n\nIt was later advised that the city remain separate from the cloister, and respect that separation. This suggests the building of an enclosure or wall surrounding the buildings and gardens of the monastery. This first is called monastic enclosure or cloister.\n\nThe second concept is referred to the domus, i.e. the group of houses which constitute the monastery. Documents refer to two different places within the monasteries: domus domorum, or ultimate home, which refers to the church building, and [[maior domus]], which is the served as [[bedroom]]s and community activities. According to the surviving descriptions and annotations, the maior domus should be a dependency of high architectural quality and large size, standing next to the church, at the height of the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]].\n\nIn the domus as a whole, there were several required dwellings such as the cilla, [[nursing]], the punishment cell, the [[novitiate]], the gatekeeper's shelter. What would be called a [[chapter house]] centuries later among the Benedictines was referred to at this time as a conference room in these early Hispanic monasteries. Many documents mention this space and its utility but historians are not certain where it was located. It is known that minor issues monks gathered in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]].\n\nDocumentation of these early Hispanic monasteries is abundant and descriptive. However, only a few of the cloisters have been preserved; the rest of the sites are lost and archaeological evidence is inconclusive.\n\n===Repopulation of the monasteries===\n\nMany monasteries arose in the tenth century on land reclaimed in hitherto barren areas, no man's land, or abandoned places in the basin of the [[Duero]] and Bierzo in Le\u00f3n. The monasteries might construct new buildings or small [[church (building)|church]]es, or restore those crumbling and neglected earlier that new monks transformed and supplemented with monastic dependencies. In many cases, these areas were found to be inhabited by small groups, pastoralists, and [[farmer]]s attached to their land.\n\nThe monks who created this kind of monastery came from both the South (especially Cordoba, at a time of [[persecution of Christians]] in that city) and the North, bringing with them the influence of their region of origin, but without forgetting the traditional [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish-Gothic]] forms. The architectural heritage survived almost two centuries despite the abandonment will be restored by these people repopulating. The lands of the Duero valley will witness the revival of architecture over the neo-visigothic 10th and 11th centuries, while the first Romanesque building started in Catalan lands in the year 1000. This is demonstrated in small churches, the only remains of the monasteries of that period that have survived until today (2008).\n\nMany of these religious buildings took advantage of those surviving from the Visigothic period and [[mosque]]s, especially in [[Aragon]] first and, later, Andalusia.\n\n====Building components and ornaments====\n\nBuildings of this age have much in common, so some generalizations can be made about elements of [[construction]] and [[ornament (art)|ornament]]ation.\n\nPrimary materials are [[Rubble masonry|rubble]], stone and wood. Walls are constructed of either masonry or courses of stone blocks. The latter is typical of places with nearby quarries, as [[slate]] is often used where it is common. When the building is of [[masonry]], lintels, corners and windows will be reinforced with stone blocks.\n\nVaults, roofs, arches and columns often presented a problem. The builders' ideal was to construct ceilings in stone [[barrel vault]], but this was not always possible, whether because of the high cost of the labor or other technical difficulties. Very few edifices managed to use barrel vaults throughout the building; stone vaulting was often used only in the [[apse]]s and wooden framing was used in the rest of the building. Smaller churches tried vaulting, but were forced to economize with poor materials, such as tufa stone, brick and masonry.\n\nThe [[horseshoe arch]] design of the vaults is in the tradition of [[Asturian architecture]] with some influence from [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]], and in some cases following influence of the Mozarabic Cordoba. The influence of Cordoba art on these buildings is manifested in the [[ribbed vault]]s.\n\n[[Santiago de Pe\u00f1alba]] is an example of Mozarabic [[alfiz]] arches.\n\nThe arch is a common architectural design, though the Moorish horseshoe arch differs from the Spaniard in that it cannot be close to 2/3 of the ratio<!-- not sure how to translate this into English-language architectural terminology --> Sometimes the same building may include both styles, as in [[San Miguel de Escalada]].\n\nThe columns utilize techniques used in other buildings and styles, usually [[Roman architecture|Romans]]. Its discovery by the builders, ownership and carry is a fact and the usual great convenience. Sometimes come from places far from their final destination. Many of the capitals are also reused, those developed specifically for the building following a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] tradition of drawing the characteristic necking stranded (such as wreathed Asturias).\n\nOrnamental architecture did not reach a great development. [[Eaves]] were decorated, and the openings of the windows filled with beautiful stone lattices. Many times the doors and windows were framed with alfiz. But there are very many entries as a decoration paramental, they are of all kinds; funeral, consecration, foundation, etc. Are written in good handwriting and on the basis of good material, usually [[marble]].\n\n====Painting====\n\n[[Painting]] was the final step in construction of a church; the building was not considered finished until the walls were painted inside and out. Only a few traces of paint have been preserved over the centuries since, not only is paint the least resistant decorative element over time but also nineteenth century restorations removed or covered up these murals. If the exterior was plastered, the plastering was often scraped off to reveal the underlying material. This trend continued throughout the twentieth century and continues into the twenty-first century.\n\nBuildings were often painted with a specific tone and the details on arches, moldings, capitals, imposts and other architectural components would have been picked out in a different color. It is known that the Church of Santiago de Pe\u00f1alba had a red painted base, 73&nbsp;cm in height, both outside and inside.\n\n====Geographical locations of churches of the repopulation====\n\n*Monasterio de San Miguel de Escalada, in the province of Le\u00f3n, which was founded by the abbot who arrived from Cordoba, existed at the time of [[Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso III]]. It was an ancient temple dedicated to San Miguel. The monastery was consecrated in 913 by Bishop Gennadius of Astorga.\n*Monasterio de San Cebri\u00e1n de Mazote in Valladolid, a town in of Mazote San Cebri\u00e1n, founded during the reign of [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]] by monks who came from Cordoba.\n*Monasterio de San Rom\u00e1n de Hornija. It is known from documents, [[Chindasvinto]] died in 653 and was buried in a monastery that existed here. In the twelfth century it was a priory of the monastery of San Pedro de Montes in the region of Bierzo, Le\u00f3n.\n\n===Cluny in Spain===\nThe church of Santa Maria de Piasca ([[Cantabria]]) is one of the most important priories in the service of the Cluniac monastic order of [[Sahag\u00fan, C\u00f3rdoba|Sahag\u00fan]].\n\nIn Catalonia, the abbot Oliba had strong ties with the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]], but it was strictly a spiritual relationship, and had no legal connotations. Via this abbot, King [[Sancho III of Navarre]] established relations with the abbot [[Saint Odilo of Cluny|St. Odilon de Cluny]], which resulted in a Cluniac abbot being put in charge of the monastery of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a. As a result of this action the Cluniac influence spread through monasteries that were in the domains of Sancho III. The spiritual relationship with the Abbey of Cluny continued with the descendants of Sancho III until the reign of [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|King Alfonso VI]] with whom the relationship moved from being a purely spiritual sympathy to one which has economic ties and political and religious influences. The monastery of Sahag\u00fan in [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was a central one, as it was the biggest propagator of the Cluniac observance. Alfonso VI became the center of Cluny and became its protector. It was called \"The Spanish Cluny\", the abbey being more powerful in the kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Castile, which had nearly 100 monasteries. Alfonso was owner of the land ranging from the [[Cantabrian Sea]] to the [[River Duero]]. Sahagun was a central influence in Spain of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\n===The Cistercians in Spain===\n\nThe [[Moreruela Abbey|Moreruela]] monastery (Zamora) was the first Cistercian enclave on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; it was founded in 1133 in the reign of [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VII]], followed by the [[Fitero Abbey|Fitero]] in 1140, [[Santa Mar\u00eda de Sobrado]], 1142, (in [[Sobrado dos Monxes]], [[La Coru\u00f1a (province)|La Coru\u00f1a]]) and the monastery of [[Poblet Monastery|Poblet]] (1150) in Catalonia, sponsored by [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Count Ram\u00f3n Berenguer IV of Barcelona]]. Moruela was part of the great Cistercian group of abbeys consisting of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] (in the valley of Absinthe, [[France]]), the Great Forest (in [[Languedoc]]), Fontfreda (near [[Narbonne]]) and Poblet. The first cloister for women was that of Santa Maria de la Caridad in [[Tulebras]] (Navarra). From this monastery, nuns departed to found the communities of [[Perales, Palencia|Perales]] ([[Palencia (province)|Palencia]]), of [[Gradefes]], Ca\u00f1as ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]), [[Trasobares]] in [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]], Vallbona, [[Lleida (province)|Lleida]] and [[Las Huelgas]] in Burgos. Cistercian monasteries, both female and male, spread throughout the peninsula.\n\n===Monasteries of the mendicant orders===\n\nThe [[mendicant orders]] (also called preachers) emerged in the early thirteenth century, with the Dominicans and Franciscans. They emerged as a spiritual response, necessary in a time when [[monastic order]]s had relaxed the norms and behavior. These mendicant orders proposed a novel mode of action based on direct action toward the faithful and the organizational system that was based on division by provinces. The convents and monasteries of these monks were always very close to or within cities. They were also placed alongside roads, especially in the [[Camino de Santiago]], in order to provide care and support to travelers.\n\nThe complex of buildings used for the mendicant groups is in keeping with the usual monastic style, but differences arise according to the needs and the work of these monks. Many of the foundation buildings were donations of houses more or less adapted to life in community. The churches were built specifically for the monastic community, or in some cases expanding some existing [[chapel]] or [[shrine]]), with its own characteristics. The building's acoustics were a primary criterion in construction, as the sermons and talks with the faithful were common practice. Churches were divided into two parts, one for those attending mass and another for the monks' enclosures. These churches did not continue a distinct style but adapted to the current fashion and geographical needs. Another feature was the small number of chapels in the wings, in contrast to the Cistercian churches. This is because the rules do not oblige each monk to say daily Mass, quite the contrary. [[Francis of Assisi]] said in the General Chapter \"In places where the monks dwell be held one Mass a day [...] but if somewhere has many priests, with a love of charity is happy listening to the mass of the other.\"\n\nConstruction materials are typically poor, with a few severe facade sculptures, a polygonal apse with large window openings. The monasteries adapted and assimilated local building traditions to the community's needs, so churches vary depending on geographic location. In Spain there were two models: buildings with a [[Latin cross]] and buildings with a single [[nave]] with chapels between [[buttress]]es.\n\nIn Navarre there was a proliferation of mendicant convents during the reign of Champagne, especially with [[Theobald II of Navarre|Theobald II]] was defined as chief patron and protector. In Castilla y Le\u00f3n were many convents but most which have survived to the twenty-first century are badly deteriorated.\n\n===Paired Monasteries===\n\nPaired monasteries were those made jointly by male and female communities, within the [[High Middle Ages]] achieved considerable importance. These monasteries had their origin in the monasteries turned into family homes where whole families decided to benefit from religious rules and form a [[monastic community]] whose members spent the rest of their days without leaving the house. It was a kind of exalted fashion and later came to commit errors and excesses such that they were reprimanded by the religious leaders. There was a text, Regula Communis, written for these monasteries. This rule made clear the changes in architectural design made necessary by this combining of communities: all spaces should be double so that the female community was separated from the male; they might share only the chapter, but must sit apart. As for the bedrooms, not only ordered that they were separated but well away from each other.\n\nIn time, these monasteries came to be officially removed, but still, in the twelfth century, a group of thirty-one nuns nicknamed ''tuquinegras'' lived with a large number of monks, men who were supposed to protect and who were known by the name of milites. No buildings have been preserved from these monastic communities other than the churches.\n\n===Monasteries of military orders===\n\nThe [[Military order (society)|Military Order]]s built their own monasteries which served also as a fortress of defense, though otherwise the houses followed the monastic premise as other monasteries did. A typical example of this type of monastery is the [[Calatrava la Nueva]], headquarters of the [[Order of Calatrava]] founded by the Abbot of Fitero, Raymond, at the behest of King Sancho III of Castile, to protect the area restored to the [[Muslim]]s. Other orders as [[Order of Santiago]], [[Knights Templar]] and [[Canons of the Holy Sepulchre]] devoted much of their efforts to protect and care for pilgrims on the [[Camino de Santiago]].\n\n*[[Monasterio de Ucl\u00e9s]] (in the current province of [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]) was the headquarters of the [[Order of Santiago]] since 1174.\n*Montesa Castle (now the province of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]) came from the Aragonese [[Order of Montesa]].\n*The Conventual de [[San Benito de Alc\u00e1ntara]] was of the [[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]].\n*[[Ponferrada]] Castle of the [[Knights Templar]].\n\n===The monasteries on the Camino de Santiago===\n\nAlthough many monasteries emerged along the [[Way of St. James|Camino de Santiago]], some have disappeared altogether. Typical of the monasteries' aid to travelers are the thirty-two [[hospital]]s or [[hospice]]s governed by a small community of monks belonging to different orders, but many of the monasteries of this route have also attached their own hospitals. Here is a list of the most important monasteries of this route:\n\n====Huesca====\n*[[San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]. Affiliated with the [[Aragonese monarchs]] and Navarre.\n\n====Navarra====\n*Leyre Monastery, Benedictine, the focus of the Reconquista and refuge of kings and bishops of Navarre. It has an attached [[guesthouse]] for pilgrims.\n*Convento de Santo Domingo ([[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]]), foundation of Theobald II of Navarre in 1259.\n*Monastery of Our Lady the Royal Irache, which is not along the road's route but in a detour from [[Ayegui]]. It is one of the oldest Benedictine monasteries in Navarre; it is possibly of Visigoth design. The hospital was founded by [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre]] in 1051.\n\n====La Rioja====\n*Convent of San Anton in [[Navarrete, La Rioja|Navarrete]], of which only ruins remain.\n*Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de N\u00e1jera, founded by [[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n]] along with a hospital for pilgrims. Alfonso VI joined the monastery at Cluny in 1079, to promote the pilgrimage, in opposition to the bishop of N\u00e1jera who moved to [[Calahorra]] in protest. This monastery is the tomb of the [[kings of Navarre]]. It has been run by Franciscan friars since 1895.\n*Ca\u00f1as Monastery (home of [[Santo Domingo de Silos]]). Female Cistercian abbey founded in 1170.\n\n====Burgos====\n*Monastery of San F\u00e9lix de Oca on the hill of [[San Felices]] which dates from the ninth century. In 1049, it was annexed to [[San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla]]. According to tradition, Diego Porcelos, the founder of the city of Burgos, is buried here. The apse is the only remaining structure from this monastic community.\n*Monastery of San Juan de Ortega. [[San Juan de Ortega]] founded this place to resemble a pilgrims' hospital rather than a monastery. In 1170, Alfonso VIII relinquished the hospital to the jurisdiction of Burgos, and in 1432 the Church of Burgos took over the Order of St. Jerome.\n*Monastery of [[San Juan Evangelista]], outside of Burgos, a former hospital complex that Alfonso VI began in 1091 under the protection of the Benedictine Abbey of [[Chaise-Dieu]] in the [[Haute-Loire]], with San Lesmes as prior. Only the chapter house and cloister remain of the monastery, while only the facade remains of the church convent.\n*Monastery of las Huelgas, which ran the King's Hospital, founded by Alfonso VI on behalf of the pilgrims.\n*The Benedictine monastery of Rocamador was dependent on donations and privileges granted by [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. It was founded to assist pilgrims with a difficult passage between Hornillos del Camino to [[Castrojeriz]].\n*Convent of San Ant\u00f3n de Castrojeriz. This convent was founded by [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] in 1146 for the [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony|Order of St. Anthony]], of French origin. The monastery had been reduced to ruins in the fourteenth century with the exception of a [[Gothic arch]] to the left of the great portal, under which the road passed.\n*The Cistercian monastery of Castrojeriz emerged in conjunction with the Pilgrims' Hospital founded by Count [[Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara]] and his wife Teresa. It was near the Fitero Bridge (Pons Fiteria) the river [[Pisuerga]].\n\n====Palencia====\n\n*The Benedictine monastery, founded by the lady Mayor in 1035 in the town of [[Fr\u00f3mista]], of which remains only the church of San Mart\u00edn, a good example of the Romanesque architecture of the twelfth century.\n*Monastery of Santa Clara ([[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]]), founded in the thirteenth century.\n*Former [[Abbey of Santa Maria de Benev\u00edvere]], twelfth century. Only ruins remain.\n*Monastery of San Zoilo, on the Carri\u00f3n river near Carri\u00f3n de los Condes, a great center of refuge for pilgrims; the tombs of the Infantes of Carri\u00f3n are located here.\n*Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de las Tiendas, also founded in the eleventh century, belonging to the [[order of Santiago]], near Tiendas. Only vestiges of the monastery remain, which the present farmhouse incorporates.\n\n====Leon====\n*Monastery of San Benito el Real de Sahagun, whose Cluniac monks arrived in 1080. This was the main [[abbey]] on the peninsula, which expanded to 60 beds for pilgrims in their own hospital.\n*Monastery of San Agustin in [[Mansilla de las Mulas]], disappeared, leaving only the Arco de San Agust\u00edn near Pilgrim Street.\n\n====Lugo====\n*Samos Monastery, Benedictine, with a shelter for pilgrims of high rank. The masses were housed in separate houses of the abbey.\n*Monastery of la Magdalena, in [[Sarria]], founded by two Italian priests of the Order of St. Augustine. As of 2007, this monastery is in charge of priests belonging to the Orden de la Merced, and as is traditional, welcome pilgrims. Their adjunct hospital had a reputation for caring for pilgrims.\n*Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Loio, in the small village of Loio Lugo. The hermit dwelling was restored by a monk named Limerick. It was the birthplace of the [[Knights of Santiago]] to 1170. Almost no traces of its original location remain.\n*Monastery of Villar de Donas, past a place called Ligond\u00e9, it is necessary to deviate from the road to get here. It was originally a small convent for members of the Arias family of [[Monterroso]] and in 1184 belonged to the Order of Santiago. In 2007, only the church, which houses paintings from the fourteenth century, remains standing.\n\n====La Coru\u00f1a====\n*[[Monastery of San Mart\u00edn Pinario]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], former Benedictine monastery, now a major seminary.\n*[[Saint John of Caaveiro|Caaveiro Monastery]], in the [[Fragas do Eume]].\n*Monastery of Sancti Spiritus ([[Melide, A Coru\u00f1a|Melide]]) at the front entrance to the Melide Hospital. All that remains is the Romanesque church of Santa Maria, which dates from the eighth century, and is the current parish.\n*Augustinian Convent ([[Arz\u00faa]]) with its own hospital in the town of Arz\u00faa; all that remains is church of the Magdalene and part of the fabric of the hospital.\n\n===Palaces in monasteries===\n\nThe royal [[palace]] in this institution is one of the characteristics of the Spanish monastery.\n\nOccasionally, already constructed buildings were willingly converted into a palace. Such is the case of Tordesillas, [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]] and Paular. In other instances, the monastery offered a residence to the king or the nobility when they traveled for matters relating to their own Reconquista or to follow the travels of the courts of Castile and Aragon. In some monasteries the palatial residence required building a new building inside the compound, as in the monasteries of Poblet, [[Carracedo]] and [[Yuste]]. The monastery of [[El Escorial]] was conceived from the beginning with a specific architecture and set of structures to house the monks and the king and his court.\n\n===Monasteries as palaces===\n\nMany Spanish monasteries were built from scratch in order to house the [[tomb]]s of royal families or members of the nobility. To this end, the patrons made large donations of land, money and men. During the Middle Ages and the [[Renaissance]], it was considered of vital importance that the monks keep in their prayers the memory of the dead buried near them in churches, cloisters, or cemeteries, and not only consider this important for the salvation of souls but as a perpetual reminder to future generations how important those buried were. Among the great monasteries which possessed noble or royal [[mausoleum]]s are:\n\n*[[San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]] and San Pedro el Viejo in [[Huesca]], in which are buried the kings of Aragon until Aragon joined Catalonia. In the aforementioned monastery, kings of [[kingdom of Pamplona]] are buried, when the territory was part of Navarre.\n*[[Santes Creus]] and Poblet, kings of the Crown of Aragon.\n*[[Ripoll Monastery|Ripoll]], with the counts of [[Barcelona]], before its union with Aragon.\n*[[Najera Monastery|Najera]] and Leyre, monasteries elected by the dynasties of Navarra.\n*[[San Isidoro de Le\u00f3n]], at which are buried many of the Kings of Leon.\n*[[San Salvador de O\u00f1a]] (Burgos), converted into a county and regional cemetery in the second half of the twelfth century.\n*[[Abbey of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Las Huelgas|Las Huelgas Reales de Burgos]], chosen by the Castilian monarchs.\n*Cartuja de Miraflores at Burgos, where [[Juan II of Castile]] chose to be buried, along with his second wife and his son Alfonso.\n*The Salesians in Madrid, where lies [[Fernando VI]] (the founder) and his wife [[Barbara of Braganza]].\n*El Escorial, considered as a prototype for the funeral aspects, but is the most modern of all. There are the mausoleums of the royal families of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].\n*[[San Rom\u00e1n de Hornija]], in Valladolid, which was originally a monastery founded by Chindasvinto Visigoth for his own burial and his wife Reciberga (or Reciwerga).\n\nAmong the monasteries, cemeteries and burial of the family of the nobility, there are:\n\n*[[Loeches]] Monastery where are buried the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]] and his descendants the Dukes of Alba. This is a side chapel.\n*San Francisco de Guadalajara, where the Dukes of Infantado built a [[crypt]].\n*San Jer\u00f3nimo de Granada, whose founder, Grand Master, declined to be buried there.\n*[[San Jer\u00f3nimo de Cotalba]] in [[Alfahuir]], (Valencia), in which are buried the Infantes Don Juan and Do\u00f1a Blanca de Arag\u00f3n.\n*Monastery of Parral in [[Segovia]], which holds the tomb of the Marquis de Villena.\n*Monastery of Santa Paula in [[Seville]], with the Marquis de Montemayor.\n*[[Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de N\u00e1jera]], which has an important pantheon of the Knights.\n*Porta Coeli monastery in Valladolid, in which is buried its promoter and benefactor [[Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n, Count of Oliva]], favorite of the [[Duke of Lerma]].\n*Monastery of San Pedro de Cardena, where [[El Cid]] was buried and where his wife and daughters took refuge during his exile). In the [[Spanish War of Independence|War of Independence]], the monastery was sacked by the French army and his grave desecrated.\n\n===Monasteries (or convents) as a learning center===\n\nSome religious communities have [[education]] as their main activity. The agencies and the religious way of life is no different from other monasteries, only instead of cultivating the land, their work is channeled to instruction and education. Examples of such religious houses are the Convent of Santo Domingo as the [[University of Orihuela]] (known as the Colegio de Santo Domingo) and the convent of San Esteban de Murcia.\n\nThe major universities ([[University of Salamanca]], [[Universidad de Valladolid]] and [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]) were closely linked to the regular clergy by religious orders who controlled their schools, mostly Dominicans and Augustinians, and the Jesuits from the sixteenth century. In [[college town|university town]]s, there were important monastic or conventual foundations, such as the Dominican Convent of San Esteban de Salamanca.\n\n===Urbanised Monasteries or Convents===\n\nSome monasteries and convents are located within developed areas; these tend to belong to the so-called mendicant orders, but should not be taken as a general rule. Occasionally, religious houses were built adjacent to communities, neither inside the community or in the countryside, such as Benedictines and Cistercians, and occasionally small [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]s.\n\nThese urban monasteries are similar to traditional monasteries but have their own architectural characteristics. The buildings are not in most cases surrounded by a wall or fence that isolates, the only walls being those that encircle the [[garden]] or [[orchard]]. The windows look out onto the streets of the city so it is necessary to protect those inside with blinds. Secular residents of the surrounding community have direct access to the building of the church inside of which there is a closed off area for the monks or nuns. Inside the church, the [[pulpit]] becomes a central element because these congregations have as a main goal to instruct and speak directly to the faithful.\n\nThere are other elements that distinguish convents from monasteries Female convents there are other elements that characterize them, as the existence of a wheel, the only element of contact the religious residents of the community have with the outside. The church building sometimes has an elevated choir and a choir under the feet or a choir under the side of the [[chancel]], separated by a communion rail.\n\nMost of these urban monasteries proliferated during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout the Spanish territory.\n\n===Decline of the Spanish monasteries===\n\nMany of the Hispanic monasteries were abandoned, forgotten and lost, over time. The medieval monasteries were maintained, although some were plundered and burned, to recover from these tragedies only with new reconstructions.\n\nThe nineteenth century was crucial for the conservation of these monastic buildings. The Spanish War of Independence brought many calamities; French soldiers were quartered in the buildings in some cases the churches were turned into stables or kitchens. Fires were set for heating and cooking, with the inevitable consequences. Many of the tombs were desecrated in search of possible treasures or for the mere pleasure of destroying, apart from [[robbery]] and [[theft]] of works of art in wartime. In some cases, it was believed that the destruction would bring about [[social transformation]], as was the case with the demolition of thirty-seven convents in [[Madrid]] and the convent of San Francisco (Valladolid).\n\nAfter years of peace, and of building restoration and recovery of scattered pieces, monasteries were again involved in the events of the [[Carlist Wars]], the identification of the [[Carlist]] and the clergy, most notably the burning of convents and monasteries in 1835, which included a [[massacre]] of monks. Finally, in this century, the various [[confiscation]]s ended with the realized heritage of most medieval monasteries. Many of their churches were spared because they took on a new life by becoming parishes. In some cases, other provincial institutions and individuals came forward to museums with recovered pieces, including parts of the churches' architecture. The monastic ruins went on to become a commonplace instance of [[romanticism]], and poets and musicians seeking inspiration in them; notable artists include [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[George Sand]] in the [[Valldemossa Charterhouse|Cartuja de Valldemossa]] and the B\u00e9cquer brothers [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer|Gustavo]] and [[Valeriano B\u00e9cquer|Valeriano]] in the Cistercian Monastery [[Veruela Abbey|Veruela]] (Zaragoza).\n\nIn the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the Restoration, there was a [[political climate]] more favorable to the founding of new religious orders and the restoration of the old. Some monasteries were able to revive the monastic life.\n\nIn the first third of the twentieth century, political and social critical junctures brought back to light the old Spanish [[anticlericalism]] which culminated in [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in Barcelona in 1909. In 1910, the Law of the lock prevented the establishment of new religious congregations. In 1931, shortly after the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], came a new burning of convents, but much more serious was the destruction during the [[Spanish Civil War]], with thousands of victims among the clergy.\n\nIn the last quarter century, both the Spanish state and companies became aware of the great ruined monastic heritage was lost, great buildings abandoned or poorly maintained but still remained standing part of its [[architecture]] and began the quest to give them a meaning and relevance, such as rehabilitation for [[museum]]s, cultural centers, or schools.\n\n==The architectural complex of Spanish monasteries==\n\nThe monastery and its dependencies eventually consolidated with the Benedictine Order of Cluny in Romanesque period in the [[early Middle Ages]]. The monks of Cluny spread throughout [[Europe]] and founded the monasteries whose architectural structure would henceforth be an example to follow, with minor variations in some monastic orders, taking into account possible regional differences.\n\n===External Signs of buildings===\n\nIn many monasteries and convents it was traditional to construct a transept and small chapels that served as a shrine, located in the vast expanse of the garden. [[Fountain]]s and [[water well|well]]s which is usually open in the center or side of the courtyard.\n\nA common image was that of the [[patron saint]] of the warrant or the title holder of the church. Sometimes the title is kept original to the foundation of the monastery and sometimes switches to receive the relics of a saint local or foreign.\n\nSculptural decoration shields were common, signifying the monastic order as appropriate, those of kings or noble founders or sponsors, [[bishop]]s (where applicable) and the arms of the city. It is also common to see figures representing the founder.\n\nAn important addition is the tower or steeple with a bell serving as the municipal clock. The language of the bells was very important during the Middle Ages and Renaissance as well as representing the time, as was the town crier announcing events.\n\n===The church===\n\nThe churches of the monasteries have some features that differentiate them from those of [[secular clergy]], especially in regard to the chorus, [[Vestry|vestries]] and penitential cells. In all other respects, they follow the same rules and practice space is dedicated to the [[liturgy]], with the center of spiritual life and religious communities.\n\nChurches are always oriented to the east, like other Christian churches (except in cases where the place names force a placement). Its plan is a Latin cross [[transept]] and [[apse]] or apses. They usually have three gates: the main foot, which gives access to outdoor and one in the side wall to access the cloister, used exclusively by the monks, and a third located in the transept, which leads to the sacristy.\n\n====Side chapels and shrines====\n\nMonasteries placed several chapels or simple [[altar]]s in small spaces due to the requirement that the monks had to say daily Mass each. However, in the convents, this need did not exist because there was only one [[chaplain]] for the entire community. This reasoning applies to the [[sacristy]], which were more spacious in monasteries than convents.\n\n====Presbytery====\n\nThe altar would be placed in this part of the church. Placement of the altar was usually connected with a sculpture of the patron saint of the monastery. In some religious houses, this image is tucked into a niche suitable for pilgrims to visit, such as the monastery of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].\n\n====Choir====\n\nThe choir was customarily located in the middle of the nave in the Spanish monasteries, separated from the chancel by the transept. It might also be located in the apse behind the main altar, surrounded by a circular wall. The choir in the middle of the church is an enclosed space that is usually surrounded by a screen. Inside, it is furnished with seating with ornamentation used to instruct artists. Both armrests and backs are profusely decorated with carvings that are iconographic animal symbols, [[mythology]], [[Allegory|allegories]], genre scenes and so on. In the center of the choir is lectern furniture that supports the great liturgical [[choral music]] book, written in large characters that can be read from afar by the monks. The organ was placed in a lateral.\n\n===The cloister===\n\nThe quintessential medieval Spanish cloister is the Benedictine whose pattern spread throughout Christian Europe. Its construction consists of four galleries called ''pandas'', one of them  attached to the south or north nave of the church. One gallery is dedicated always to the chapter house and another small unit. The west gallery houses usually the cilla and laymen, and the gallery border to the church has the refectory and kitchen calefactory. In some monasteries, the profundis room is replaced by the refectory where the monks chant [[Psalm]]\n\"De profundis ad te Dominum clamavi ...\"\n[[Psalm 130]] (129)\n\n===Infirmaries, herbal medicine and herb garden===\n\nOne of Saint Benedict's foremost edicts concerned caring for the ill indigent residents around the monasteries. To this end, the monasteries established hospitals both inside the monastery grounds and elsewhere in the community. Inside the monastery, there was an infirmary which treated the friars themselves and on occasion, ill visitors. As a complement to this infirmary, monasteries often had stores of herbal or botanic medicines, supplied by the monastery's garden. In some cases, this infirmary and associated medical stores might expand beyond the needs of the monastery and the surrounding community. This is true of the monastery of [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey|Santo Domingo de Silos]], which was founded in 1705 at the request of the town of [[Santo Domingo de Silos|Silos]]. It became a famous chemist and recognized in the region, which is today quite well preserved; it is a museum for those who wish to study what these infirmaries were like. One particular display is that of a collection of jars produced in [[Talavera de la Reina]], for the center, with the coat of arms of the monastery.\n\nThere are many documents about these aromatic gardens cultivated by the monks. In the monastery of Santa Maria de Matallana in the province of Valladolid, reconstruction of the ruins revealed the space that monks had devoted to this garden, growing plants. Another major herbarium was the monastery of San Juli\u00e1n de Samos in the province of [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]].\n\nThe [[Apothecary|apothecaries]] were served by the monks, themselves specialized. They carried out all relevant tasks for the manufacture of [[medicine]]s, [[ointment]]s, and spirits both medicinal and otherwise. Many of these pharmacies have conserved tools such as the stills used for [[distillation]].\n\n===Scriptorium and library===\n\nIn the High and [[Late medieval|Late Medieval]] period, much learning and literature was in the hands of the monasteries. It was there that knowledge was preserved, books were copied and translations made. Many of these monasteries had a [[scriptorium]] in addition to a library, furnished with benches, desks and shelves and equipped with pens, parchment, inks and other tools needed for writing and painting miniatures. Judging by the illuminated manuscripts preserved in Catalonia, there is evidence that desks were abundant. The Royal Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Vallbona had not only a significant library but some furniture of the period.\n\nThe library of the monastery of [[Montserrat]] has 400 incunabula, despite the ravages of time, and the [[Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda]] in Aragon still retains its scriptorium space.\n\nAnother significant library of the period was that of [[Santa Mar\u00eda de Huerta]], Soria, built in the twelfth century and decorated in the seventeenth. In the monastery of [[Valvanera]], the rich library survives, in which there are records which refer to the Polyglot Bible Valvanera, which [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] removed to [[El Escorial]] where it was destroyed in a fire. In Galicia, the famous monastery of San Juli\u00e1n de Samos had a great library that was burned in a fire in the late twentieth century.\n\n===Cemetery for monks===\n\nUsually the monks were buried in the cloisters' crypt. The Cistercian monks were buried directly in the ground (without a [[coffin]]) and face down. The abbots were buried in the chapter house.\n\n===Other units===\n\nOne of the most important areas in a monastery is the [[garden]], large or small. It supplied both food and a place for monks to come do penance or for spiritual retreats. The large monasteries had similarly large gardens with all kinds of facilities, from fountains, [[canal]]s and wells. In some minor orders, the gardens had simply small chapels or [[oratory (worship)|oratories]].\n\nSometimes [[inn]]s were built outside the closure area. Over time and with the growing authority of the abbot, the religious houses were  wont to build their own house, where the abbot might receive important guests.\n\nLarger monasteries provided not only the means for the monks' subsistence but for a strong local economic base, with workshops, foundries, mills, potteries, wineries, and other small businesses.\n\n==Heritage==\n\nDespite the great vicissitudes suffered by the Spanish monasteries\u2014fire, theft, plundering, confiscations, laziness\u2014there still remains still a considerable heritage of artistic furnishings.\n\nThe monasteries tried to move away from the heritage of austerity required of [[Asceticism|ascetics]], without exhibiting any external signs of wealth. Maintaining this position was virtually impossible because of the desire of lay founders, sponsors and donors that their gifts be visible as indications of their power, generosity and position. All these monasteries developed a rich collection of art, and this display did not escape the strictest order in this regard, the [[Carthusian Order]].\n\nIn the Renaissance and [[Baroque period]], the great chapel altars and those of smaller subsidiary chapels, following the new concept of post-Counter liturgical life. Thus arose the sculpted altarpieces, such as that by [[Dami\u00e1n Forment]] in the monastery of Poblet, which resulted in such an extravagant expenditure that the monks rebelled against the abbot. Another example of a huge altarpiece was in the monastery of San Benito el Real de Valladolid, a masterpiece of [[Alonso Berruguete|Berruguete Alonso]], which is kept at present at the [[National Museum of Sculpture (Valladolid)|National Museum of Sculpture]] in the city.\n\nThe vestries were enriched not only with the necessary furniture but adorned with works of famous painters, often in valuable frames. Also paintings of kings and nobility often hung on the walls of the churches or cloisters as symbols of or to attract their patronage.\n\nMany monasteries have liturgical pieces, and large pieces of [[jewelry]] displayed in glass cases along with textile items, such as vestments and clothing. Some monasteries are by themselves a veritable museum of art, like the Descalzas Real in Madrid. Others have opened up within its walls (taking advantage of old farms) where to place a museum and recovered missing pieces, such is the case of Poblet whose museum occupies the area that was the Palace of King [[Martin the Humane]] in Poblet. Counted among their treasure are valuable books.\n\n==Some notable monasteries==\n\nSome monasteries have historical significance or are simply interesting. The short listing here does not imply that these monasteries are the best or most important, but simply interesting histories.\n\n===Monastery of San Benito el Real de Sahag\u00fan===\n\nThis monastery was important enough that it was referred to as the Spanish Cluny. It was the most powerful and influential Benedictine monastery of the Middle Ages in the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]]. It was protected and promoted by King Alfonso VI which, among other privileges granted to preserve the protected [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Urraca]] also gave the monastery the right to mint its own currency and the Jews of the town as vassals by King Alfonso VII. Its heritage spanned the provinces of Le\u00f3n, Valladolid, Palencia, [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]] and Cantabria, thus counting a far larger number of subjects under their jurisdiction than the holdings of other important figures of the time. From the religious point of view, Sahagun was the center from which sprang at the behest of Pope Gregory VII the new Roman liturgy which replaced Spanish [[Mozarabic Rite]]. Father Sandoval and Father Yepes listed fifty to sixty monasteries and a large number of churches which depended on Sahag\u00fan. The monastery's influence stretched from Toledo and from Cantabria Rioja to Galicia.\n\n===Monastery of San Benito el Real Valladolid===\n\nIts founding in 1389 brought a new reform of the Benedictine order under the royal protection of [[Juan I of Castile|Juan I]] and the blessing of [[Pope Clement VII]]; the \"black monks\" had relaxed their strictures, forgetting Saint Benedict's strictures so far as to sleep outside the monasteries. This monastery instilled its members with a respect for the example of Saint Benedict. The cloister was the property of the monastery, not only from the spiritual perspective but the physical, with a double gate installed in the entries. The principle was established with toughness and authority of perpetual abstinence, fasting and severity in the monk's practice and in their habitations; it also enforced generosity to the needy in the form of sharing food, money and fuel. Valladolid took the lead in the fifteenth century reforms of the Benedictine orders in Spain, and other Benedictine monasteries became dependent on it Valladolid, as did the Congregation of San Benito de Valladolid, after the papal bull of [[Pope Alexander VI]]. To this end, many chapters drafted the relevant constitutions.\n\n===Monastery of Poblet===\n\nPoblet was founded by the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV. It was one of the four great Cistercian abbeys of [[Christendom]], along with Clairvaux, in Absinthe, France; the Great Forest, in Languedoc; and Fontfreda, near Narbonne). In 1340, Peter ordered the crypts for royalty and nobility to be created, which became an important center for burial. The abbots of Poblet became a very powerful part of the clergy who participated in [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]]; one abbot even became president of the Generalitat. The involvement of the abbots in Catalan wars became apparent.\n\n===Monastery of La Rabida===\nThis is a Franciscan monastery in the town of [[Palos de la Frontera]], in Huelva province. This was an important place in the history of Spain since its participation in the negotiations which took place between the friars and Fray Antonio de Marchena Friar Juan Perez and Colon during the four visits he made. The monks helped and supported Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs, and as such the monastery is part of what is termed \"Columbus's Places\" in Andalusia.\n\n===Monastery of San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla===\n\nIn this small and humble monastery were first written the annotations or glosses called Emilian Glosses written in \"romance\", a little- studied form of Castilian derived from Latin, and two or three in [[Euskera]]. It is considered the cradle of these languages.\n\n===Monastery of Guadalupe===\n\nIt had a famous scriptorium which produced a series of illuminated books, many of which are preserved in the museum of the monastery. The medieval image of the Virgin of Guadalupe which was taken by the discoverers of [[Extremadura]] to the Americas. This images is particularly venerated in Mexico.\n\nMany well known historical figures passed through the monastery as pilgrims: [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], King [[Sebastian of Portugal]], [[Teresa de Jesus Buenfil]], [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] (in 1982.)\n\n===Monastery of Santo Toribio de Liebana===\n\nFounded in the sixth century in the Cantabrian region of [[Li\u00e9bana]], this monastery held from the eighth century a relic of the [[True Cross]], supposedly the largest fragment preserved. At the same time, the monk [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] wrote two works of great significance: the Commentary on Revelation, of which several valuable illuminated illustrated copies are held, and the refutation of heresy that had spread among Mozarabic Christians under Muslim occupation and [[Elipando]], bishop of Toledo. The monastery regularly celebrated a Jubilee or Holy Year Liebana.\n\n===Monastery of San Salvador de Tabara===\n\nThis was a two-part monastery of monks and nuns in the Visigothic tradition, founded by [[Froila (Bishop of Lugo)|Abbot Froila]], under the patronage of Alfonso III and located 43&nbsp;km northeast of Zamora. The excavations brought to light two columnar towers and an arch that led to the lower room of the tower. In this tower was the scriptorium where the monk Emeterio finished illuminating the Beatus miniatures Tabara, initiated by his master, Magio. Emeterio himself writes the following account:\n\n\"Oh T\u00e1bara tower, high tower of stone! It's there in the top and into the first room of the library, where sat Emeterio and hunched over his homework, over 3 months, and all the members crippled by the work of the pen. 52 was finished this book 6 of the Kalends of August, the year 1008 was Hispanic, 53 to the facet hour.\"\n\nThis phrase, along with an illustration of the tower workplace, have been highly valued for depicting how such work was in the monasteries.\n\n===Monastery of El Palancar===\nFounded by [[San Pedro de Alcantara]] Acim Pedroso ([[C\u00e1ceres (province)]]) in 1557, this was considered the world's smallest religious house. Subsequently extended, it retained the original area under the name of the convent. In a tiny space, were built several structures  a chapel for the offices large enough to fit only the officiant and an acolyte, to which is attached the founder's cell, which describes [[Santa Teresa de Jes\u00fas]] this way:\nIt seems they were forty years, he told me he had slept one hour and a half between night and day, and it was the greatest work of penance that had in the early to beat the dream and it was always or kneeling or standing. I was sitting and sleeping head leaning against a maderillo he had driven into the wall. Lying, even if I wanted, I could not because his cell as we know, was not longer than four feet and a half.\n\n===Monastery of El Escorial===\nDesigned to be not only a monastery but a royal residence and as a pantheon of kings of the houses of Austria and Bourbon. It is a monastery known and admired worldwide. Herrera architecture was revolutionary in Spanish art, and El Escorial retains great treasures and its library and art gallery spaces are considered to hold very rich and valuable collections.\n\n===Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen===\nLocated in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] mountain range near Madrid, this led in the years after its building to a great social impact, not only by the vast proportion its construction but its later role in burials.\n\n==Spanish monasteries in the 21st century==\n\nMany monasteries have crumbled over the centuries, leaving no trace of their existence. However, some may be described by researchers who have access to related documents. In some cases, these documents only speak of history, but in other cases, contracts or purchases remain fairly accurately related to the buildings. A large number of the monasteries have only the church as a witness of the complex that might be. At other times, ruins remain which are being transformed to a fruitful use. Occasionally buildings which remained intact over the centuries have been converted into a hotel, a school or a restaurant. In none of these cases, has the modern business retained the property the garden or nearby buildings.\n\nAlso many of these medieval monasteries have regained their original function and survive as a community of monks or nuns. In the absence of patronage and custom or donations, these religious people adapt to modern life with modern media and subsist on the work undertaken by the community's members: confectionery, wine and spirits, cheese, bee hives, poultry farms, textiles and fiber arts, writing scores, dissertations, obituaries, advanced computing, pottery of all kinds, decorated white porcelain, artisanal food, farming, vestments, textiles, caring for sick and elderly, schools and daycare.\n\nIn addition, about 250 monasteries have a guest house for lay people who must follow some basic rules, with minimal cost.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504184948/http://www.patrimonionacional.es/monast.htm Monasterios y Conventos reales en Espa\u00f1a] (web del Patromonio Nacional espa\u00f1ol)\n* [http://www.catolicos.com/monasteriosespana.htm Monasterios cat\u00f3licos en Espa\u00f1a en la actualidad]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504184948/http://www.patrimonionacional.es/monast.htm Monasteries and Convents in Spain] (Spanish National official World Heritage Site website)\n* [http://www.catolicos.com/monasteriosespana.htm Catholic Monasteries in Spain at the moment] (Catholic site)\n\n{{Architecture of Spain}}\n\n[[Category:Religion in Spain]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures in Spain]]\n[[Category:Monasteries in Spain| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of monasteries|Spain]]\n", "text_old": "'''Monasteries in Spain''' have a rich artistic and cultural tradition, and serve as testament to Spain's [[religious history]] and [[political history|political]]-[[military history]], from the [[Visigoths|Visigothic Period]] to the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Monastery|monasteries]] played an important role in the recruitment conducted by Christian aristocracy during and after the progress of the [[Reconquista]], with the consequent decline in the [[Muslim Spain|Muslim south]] of the [[peninsula]].\n\nTheir presence in the peninsula dates from the early centuries of [[Christianity]], when the original [[hermit]] life gave rise to the formation of religious communities and the construction of small monasteries by Hispanics in the sixth and seventh centuries. Many of these buildings reflect the traditional style of [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]].\n\nThe second phase was developed with the arrival of the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictines]] of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], during the Reconquista and several new orders developed at this time: [[Cistercians|Cistercian]], [[Military order (society)|military order]]s, [[Premonstratensian]], [[Carthusian monastery|Carthusians]], Jeromes, [[Augustinians]], [[Camaldolese]] and beggars.\n\nMonastic communities of various sizes sprang up from [[Catalonia]] to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]; some of these structures remain while others were abandoned or destroyed. Most of the monasteries in [[Spain]] are distributed in the northern half in line with the historical discourse of the zone in the Middle Ages. Monasteries are much less numerous in the south, [[Andalusia]] and the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nThe establishment of monasteries during the Middle Ages was paramount from a social and cultural standpoint, benefiting the arts and [[agriculture]].\n\nThe [[Camino de Santiago]] proved an important factor in locations of these monastic orders, as often an important objective was to support the [[pilgrim]]s traveling along this route.\n\n==Characteristics and evolution of the monastery in Spain==\n\nThe first reference to a monastery in Spain was in a letter from [[Saint Augustine|St. Augustine]] to the [[abbot]] of the Monastery of [[Cabrera, Balearic Islands|Cabrera]], written in 398. In 410, the monk Baquiario first used the term ''monastery'' in a text written in [[Hispania]]. He, as a [[monk]], and [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]], and the [[nun]] Etheria, perhaps more properly a [[consecrated virgin]], were the first such members of religious houses whose names are known.\n\nThe first monasteries arose in the fourth century and were humble buildings erected in the shadow of shrines dedicated to or graves of beloved local [[martyr]]s. Many of these monastic people were troglodytes, or cave dwellers, as hermits or recluses who served as models for later monastic culture preferred to live in caves equipped to be shelters or shrines. Such is the origin of the monastery of [[San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla]], which preserves as a shrine the cave where [[Saint Aemilianus|Aemilianus]], also known as Mill\u00e1n, lived. The caves served as dwellings for disciples of this saint. The practice of living apart from the world was transformed by monks belonging to monasteries; although they lived in communities, the individuals within the community maintained their [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice, living in a remote location, often in the desert.\n\nThe quantitative success of [[monasticism]] in the Visigothic period led to clashes with the secular clergy, and they brought this dispute to the [[Councils of Toledo]]. Much of this conflict derived from the social and economic benefits that were accorded as privileges of the monastic life. In some cases, as in the area of [[El Bierzo]], monasteries, such as [[Compludo]] and Ruphianensi Monasterium, accepted whole families. Others which served as foundations of [[Fructuosus of Braga]] had the appearance of real villages. In other areas, such as Andalusia, monasteries were segregated by gender. Some sources also attributed more extreme features of the hermit movement, such as social protest, to the more extreme features of the hermit movement, especially in areas such as [[Burgos (province)|Burgos]], [[\u00c1lava]] and [[Logro\u00f1o]]. This is in parallel with other religious movements as [[Priscillianism|heresy Priscillianist]], which survived in Galicia and other areas into the sixth century.\n\nIn the following centuries, Hispanic monasteries emerged and expanded, developing their own set of similar characteristics, with a purely Hispanic artistic style. With the arrival of the monks of Cluny in the eleventh century, and the [[Order of Saint Benedict|order of St. Benedict]] and observers of their rule, the Spanish monastery complex took on new importance and influence. This is the era of quintessential monastic life and notable edifices. Many of these clusters of buildings have survived to the modern era in various states of repair, although many are now used for purposes unrelated to monasticism. The political role of Cluny and its link with the [[monarchy]] and noble houses was decisive in the [[Europeanization]] of the Christian kingdoms of the mainland and the formation of [[feudal society]] in Spain.\n\nWith regard to the social and economic role of the Benedictine monasteries, the classic materialistic interpretations\u2014that of a feudal lord overseeing and creating the monastery\u2014are tempered by recent [[historiography]]. This study includes other aspects of the communities, such as inclusion in legal and sociological networks, using the methodology of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[microhistory]].\n\nFollowing the momentum of Cluny, Cistercians arrived with new works and reforms, followed by the Carthusians. In the thirteenth century the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], Premonstratensian and [[Jesuit]]s, arrived. Some of these groups have remained quite monastic. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, numerous monasteries and convents arose, such as the Monastery of the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos|Valley of the Fallen]].\n\nRecent monasteries founded and built in Spain were:\n\n*Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Viaceli (C\u00f3breces, [[Cantabria]]), promoted and sponsored by the brothers Manuel and Antonio Bernaldo de Quir\u00f3s and Pomar and Cistercian foundation in 1909\n*Convent of San Lorenzo in [[O\u00f1ati]], [[Guipuzcoa]], in 1928\n*Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen (Abbey of the Holy Cross in the Valley of the Fallen), 1940\u20131958, under draft Pedro Muguruza and Diego Mendez.\n*House of Spirituality of the Dominican Fathers ([[Caleruega]], Burgos), 1952 .\n*Roll Monastery (or Monastery of the Immaculate Conception ) in [[Salamanca]] 1961, created by the architect Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Alba .\n*Monasterio de Santa Maria de las Shallots ([[Hornachuelos]], [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish province)|C\u00f3rdoba]]), 1986\n\n===Foundations===\n\nMonasteries in this area were historically founded mainly by [[king]]s, [[bishop]]s and [[Nobility|nobles]]. There were a number of reasons individuals might found a monastery, largely self-serving ones: to reserve a [[burial]] there, which came with perpetual prayers by the monks on behalf of the founder's soul, sheltering a [[princess]], [[widow]], unmarried or [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]], in the case of kings. Sometimes there were political reasons for founding or protection of a particular monastery; many of the religious houses who protected were located in border areas where battles often raged, such as [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] or [[Navarre]], as was the case Matallana monastery (in the [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), or Bujedo-Navarre. Bishops had an interest in building a monastery on which to exercise their authority, especially in the feudal period, as this guaranteed an income. The nobility desired salvation for themselves and his family, plus a demonstration of political influence through sponsoring one of these great works. The [[monastic vows]] ([[poverty, chastity and obedience]]) were considered an appropriate vocation for younger sons, regardless of the sincerity or otherwise of his [[vocation]], in order to reduce the likelihood of disputes over the inheritance of the firstborn, who would then hold undivided estates according to the institution of [[primogeniture]]. This close identification between the clergy and nobility, both privileged classes, survived as an enduring connection during the Middle Ages and the [[Modern Age]] to the end of the ancien regime.\n\nOther monasteries arose without intervention from the above-mentioned members of society, when a community formed around a shrine. This is the case of the monastery of [[San Juan de Ortega]] which originally was a humble chapel founded by the saint to preserve relics of [[St. Nicholas of Bari]] Over time, sufficient people arrived to care for the shrine to require the formation of an official community. Or from hermits, in some cases doubling, that were left to be guided by any rule, as the [[Monastery of Santa Maria de Vallbona|Royal Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Vallbona]] ([[Vallbona de les Monges]]), the monastery of Santo Domingo de Oca\u00f1a ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) of the sixteenth century has the distinction of being founded by a neighbor who wanted to be close to the preachers.\n\nThere are recent foundations, of the twentieth century, whose intent is very clear from the outset, as is the spiritual community of the Dominican Fathers of Caleruega (Burgos), in 1952, destined for the convent-school-house of spirituality. The Monastery of Our Lady of the Angels of [[Palma de Mallorca]], in 1914, can be included as a religious house of education, as it was conceived as a major [[seminary]], Novitiate House, Ecumenical Centre College and routinely providing Evangelical Protestants Lutheran Germans.\n\n===The first Hispanic monasteries===\n\nDuring the sixth and seventh centuries, the Hispanic Visigoth cultures are  evidenced in a wealth of monastic communities in which ancient tradition still flourished and where the monks themselves supported monastic rule by living it. Many monasteries arose in this period.\n\nSome sources consider the Monastery of St. Victorian of Asan (in [[Sobrarbe]], [[Huesca (province)|Huesca province]]) as the first monastery founded in Spain, but more likely, given the existence of references to previous monasteries, the first initiative for foundation of churches sprang from the Visigoth king [[Gesalec]] in 506. Other possible inspirations are attributed to [[Swabia]]ns in the northwest, with the activity of San Mart\u00edn de Dumio, from [[Pannonia]]. Other founding saints such as San Donato, came from Africa J\u00e1tiva. San Fructuoso de Braga founded the monastery of Compludo in the early seventh century and twenty other foundations from Galicia to Andalusia. During the same century, [[Saint Leander|San Leandro]] and his brother [[Saint Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore]] composed their own monastic rules.\n\nMorphologically, Hispanic monasteries are clearly distinguished by two concepts:\n*Enclosing the community, which is known by the name of claustra\n*[[Cloister]]ed units, called domus.\n\nThe cloister was an enclosure that isolated and protected the monastery and its residents, which is very important to the religious life being cultivated. In one chapter, the San Isidoro rule states:\n\"The [[mill (grinding)|mill]] of the monastery on its premises only have one door and one [[Wicket gate|wicket]] to leave the garden.\"\n\nIt was later advised that the city remain separate from the cloister, and respect that separation. This suggests the building of an enclosure or wall surrounding the buildings and gardens of the monastery. This first is called monastic enclosure or cloister.\n\nThe second concept is referred to the domus, i.e. the group of houses which constitute the monastery. Documents refer to two different places within the monasteries: domus domorum, or ultimate home, which refers to the church building, and [[maior domus]], which is the served as [[bedroom]]s and community activities. According to the surviving descriptions and annotations, the maior domus should be a dependency of high architectural quality and large size, standing next to the church, at the height of the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]].\n\nIn the domus as a whole, there were several required dwellings such as the cilla, [[nursing]], the punishment cell, the [[novitiate]], the gatekeeper's shelter. What would be called a [[chapter house]] centuries later among the Benedictines was referred to at this time as a conference room in these early Hispanic monasteries. Many documents mention this space and its utility but historians are not certain where it was located. It is known that minor issues monks gathered in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]].\n\nDocumentation of these early Hispanic monasteries is abundant and descriptive. However, only a few of the cloisters have been preserved; the rest of the sites are lost and archaeological evidence is inconclusive.\n\n===Repopulation of the monasteries===\n\nMany monasteries arose in the tenth century on land reclaimed in hitherto barren areas, no man's land, or abandoned places in the basin of the [[Duero]] and Bierzo in Le\u00f3n. The monasteries might construct new buildings or small [[church (building)|church]]es, or restore those crumbling and neglected earlier that new monks transformed and supplemented with monastic dependencies. In many cases, these areas were found to be inhabited by small groups, pastoralists, and [[farmer]]s attached to their land.\n\nThe monks who created this kind of monastery came from both the South (especially Cordoba, at a time of [[persecution of Christians]] in that city) and the North, bringing with them the influence of their region of origin, but without forgetting the traditional [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish-Gothic]] forms. The architectural heritage survived almost two centuries despite the abandonment will be restored by these people repopulating. The lands of the Duero valley will witness the revival of architecture over the neo-visigothic 10th and 11th centuries, while the first Romanesque building started in Catalan lands in the year 1000. This is demonstrated in small churches, the only remains of the monasteries of that period that have survived until today (2008).\n\nMany of these religious buildings took advantage of those surviving from the Visigothic period and [[mosque]]s, especially in [[Aragon]] first and, later, Andalusia.\n\n====Building components and ornaments====\n\nBuildings of this age have much in common, so some generalizations can be made about elements of [[construction]] and [[ornament (art)|ornament]]ation.\n\nPrimary materials are [[Rubble masonry|rubble]], stone and wood. Walls are constructed of either masonry or courses of stone blocks. The latter is typical of places with nearby quarries, as [[slate]] is often used where it is common. When the building is of [[masonry]], lintels, corners and windows will be reinforced with stone blocks.\n\nVaults, roofs, arches and columns often presented a problem. The builders' ideal was to construct ceilings in stone [[barrel vault]], but this was not always possible, whether because of the high cost of the labor or other technical difficulties. Very few edifices managed to use barrel vaults throughout the building; stone vaulting was often used only in the [[apse]]s and wooden framing was used in the rest of the building. Smaller churches tried vaulting, but were forced to economize with poor materials, such as tufa stone, brick and masonry.\n\nThe [[horseshoe arch]] design of the vaults is in the tradition of [[Asturian architecture]] with some influence from [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]], and in some cases following influence of the Mozarabic Cordoba. The influence of Cordoba art on these buildings is manifested in the [[ribbed vault]]s.\n\n[[Santiago de Pe\u00f1alba]] is an example of Mozarabic [[alfiz]] arches.\n\nThe arch is a common architectural design, though the Moorish horseshoe arch differs from the Spaniard in that it cannot be close to 2/3 of the ratio<!-- not sure how to translate this into English-language architectural terminology --> Sometimes the same building may include both styles, as in [[San Miguel de Escalada]].\n\nThe columns utilize techniques used in other buildings and styles, usually [[Roman architecture|Romans]]. Its discovery by the builders, ownership and carry is a fact and the usual great convenience. Sometimes come from places far from their final destination. Many of the capitals are also reused, those developed specifically for the building following a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] tradition of drawing the characteristic necking stranded (such as wreathed Asturias).\n\nOrnamental architecture did not reach a great development. [[Eaves]] were decorated, and the openings of the windows filled with beautiful stone lattices. Many times the doors and windows were framed with alfiz. But there are very many entries as a decoration paramental, they are of all kinds; funeral, consecration, foundation, etc. Are written in good handwriting and on the basis of good material, usually [[marble]].\n\n====Painting====\n\n[[Painting]] was the final step in construction of a church; the building was not considered finished until the walls were painted inside and out. Only a few traces of paint have been preserved over the centuries since, not only is paint the least resistant decorative element over time but also nineteenth century restorations removed or covered up these murals. If the exterior was plastered, the plastering was often scraped off to reveal the underlying material. This trend continued throughout the twentieth century and continues into the twenty-first century.\n\nBuildings were often painted with a specific tone and the details on arches, moldings, capitals, imposts and other architectural components would have been picked out in a different color. It is known that the Church of Santiago de Pe\u00f1alba had a red painted base, 73&nbsp;cm in height, both outside and inside.\n\n====Geographical locations of churches of the repopulation====\n\n*Monasterio de San Miguel de Escalada, in the province of Le\u00f3n, which was founded by the abbot who arrived from Cordoba, existed at the time of [[Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso III]]. It was an ancient temple dedicated to San Miguel. The monastery was consecrated in 913 by Bishop Gennadius of Astorga.\n*Monasterio de San Cebri\u00e1n de Mazote in Valladolid, a town in of Mazote San Cebri\u00e1n, founded during the reign of [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]] by monks who came from Cordoba.\n*Monasterio de San Rom\u00e1n de Hornija. It is known from documents, [[Chindasvinto]] died in 653 and was buried in a monastery that existed here. In the twelfth century it was a priory of the monastery of San Pedro de Montes in the region of Bierzo, Le\u00f3n.\n\n===Cluny in Spain===\nThe church of Santa Maria de Piasca ([[Cantabria]]) is one of the most important priories in the service of the Cluniac monastic order of [[Sahag\u00fan, C\u00f3rdoba|Sahag\u00fan]].\n\nIn Catalonia, the abbot Oliba had strong ties with the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]], but it was strictly a spiritual relationship, and had no legal connotations. Via this abbot, King [[Sancho III of Navarre]] established relations with the abbot [[Saint Odilo of Cluny|St. Odilon de Cluny]], which resulted in a Cluniac abbot being put in charge of the monastery of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a. As a result of this action the Cluniac influence spread through monasteries that were in the domains of Sancho III. The spiritual relationship with the Abbey of Cluny continued with the descendants of Sancho III until the reign of [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|King Alfonso VI]] with whom the relationship moved from being a purely spiritual sympathy to one which has economic ties and political and religious influences. The monastery of Sahag\u00fan in [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was a central one, as it was the biggest propagator of the Cluniac observance. Alfonso VI became the center of Cluny and became its protector. It was called \"The Spanish Cluny\", the abbey being more powerful in the kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Castile, which had nearly 100 monasteries. Alfonso was owner of the land ranging from the [[Cantabrian Sea]] to the [[River Duero]]. Sahagun was a central influence in Spain of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\n===The Cistercians in Spain===\n\nThe [[Moreruela Abbey|Moreruela]] monastery (Zamora) was the first Cistercian enclave on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; it was founded in 1133 in the reign of [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VII]], followed by the [[Fitero Abbey|Fitero]] in 1140, [[Santa Mar\u00eda de Sobrado]], 1142, (in [[Sobrado dos Monxes]], [[La Coru\u00f1a (province)|La Coru\u00f1a]]) and the monastery of [[Poblet Monastery|Poblet]] (1150) in Catalonia, sponsored by [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Count Ram\u00f3n Berenguer IV of Barcelona]]. Moruela was part of the great Cistercian group of abbeys consisting of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] (in the valley of Absinthe, [[France]]), the Great Forest (in [[Languedoc]]), Fontfreda (near [[Narbonne]]) and Poblet. The first cloister for women was that of Santa Maria de la Caridad in [[Tulebras]] (Navarra). From this monastery, nuns departed to found the communities of [[Perales, Palencia|Perales]] ([[Palencia (province)|Palencia]]), of [[Gradefes]], Ca\u00f1as ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]), [[Trasobares]] in [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]], Vallbona, [[Lleida (province)|Lleida]] and [[Las Huelgas]] in Burgos. Cistercian monasteries, both female and male, spread throughout the peninsula.\n\n===Monasteries of the mendicant orders===\n\nThe [[mendicant orders]] (also called preachers) emerged in the early thirteenth century, with the Dominicans and Franciscans. They emerged as a spiritual response, necessary in a time when [[monastic order]]s had relaxed the norms and behavior. These mendicant orders proposed a novel mode of action based on direct action toward the faithful and the organizational system that was based on division by provinces. The convents and monasteries of these monks were always very close to or within cities. They were also placed alongside roads, especially in the [[Camino de Santiago]], in order to provide care and support to travelers.\n\nThe complex of buildings used for the mendicant groups is in keeping with the usual monastic style, but differences arise according to the needs and the work of these monks. Many of the foundation buildings were donations of houses more or less adapted to life in community. The churches were built specifically for the monastic community, or in some cases expanding some existing [[chapel]] or [[shrine]]), with its own characteristics. The building's acoustics were a primary criterion in construction, as the sermons and talks with the faithful were common practice. Churches were divided into two parts, one for those attending mass and another for the monks' enclosures. These churches did not continue a distinct style but adapted to the current fashion and geographical needs. Another feature was the small number of chapels in the wings, in contrast to the Cistercian churches. This is because the rules do not oblige each monk to say daily Mass, quite the contrary. [[Francis of Assisi]] said in the General Chapter \"In places where the monks dwell be held one Mass a day [...] but if somewhere has many priests, with a love of charity is happy listening to the mass of the other.\"\n\nConstruction materials are typically poor, with a few severe facade sculptures, a polygonal apse with large window openings. The monasteries adapted and assimilated local building traditions to the community's needs, so churches vary depending on geographic location. In Spain there were two models: buildings with a [[Latin cross]] and buildings with a single [[nave]] with chapels between [[buttress]]es.\n\nIn Navarre there was a proliferation of mendicant convents during the reign of Champagne, especially with [[Theobald II of Navarre|Theobald II]] was defined as chief patron and protector. In Castilla y Le\u00f3n were many convents but most which have survived to the twenty-first century are badly deteriorated.\n\n===Paired Monasteries===\n\nPaired monasteries were those made jointly by male and female communities, within the [[High Middle Ages]] achieved considerable importance. These monasteries had their origin in the monasteries turned into family homes where whole families decided to benefit from religious rules and form a [[monastic community]] whose members spent the rest of their days without leaving the house. It was a kind of exalted fashion and later came to commit errors and excesses such that they were reprimanded by the religious leaders. There was a text, Regula Communis, written for these monasteries. This rule made clear the changes in architectural design made necessary by this combining of communities: all spaces should be double so that the female community was separated from the male; they might share only the chapter, but must sit apart. As for the bedrooms, not only ordered that they were separated but well away from each other.\n\nIn time, these monasteries came to be officially removed, but still, in the twelfth century, a group of thirty-one nuns nicknamed ''tuquinegras'' lived with a large number of monks, men who were supposed to protect and who were known by the name of milites. No buildings have been preserved from these monastic communities other than the churches.\n\n===Monasteries of military orders===\n\nThe [[Military order (society)|Military Order]]s built their own monasteries which served also as a fortress of defense, though otherwise the houses followed the monastic premise as other monasteries did. A typical example of this type of monastery is the [[Calatrava la Nueva]], headquarters of the [[Order of Calatrava]] founded by the Abbot of Fitero, Raymond, at the behest of King Sancho III of Castile, to protect the area restored to the [[Muslim]]s. Other orders as [[Order of Santiago]], [[Knights Templar]] and [[Canons of the Holy Sepulchre]] devoted much of their efforts to protect and care for pilgrims on the [[Camino de Santiago]].\n\n*[[Monasterio de Ucl\u00e9s]] (in the current province of [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]) was the headquarters of the [[Order of Santiago]] since 1174.\n*Montesa Castle (now the province of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]) came from the Aragonese [[Order of Montesa]].\n*The Conventual de [[San Benito de Alc\u00e1ntara]] was of the [[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]].\n*[[Ponferrada]] Castle of the [[Knights Templar]].\n\n===The monasteries on the Camino de Santiago===\n\nAlthough many monasteries emerged along the [[Way of St. James|Camino de Santiago]], some have disappeared altogether. Typical of the monasteries' aid to travelers are the thirty-two[[hospital]]s or [[hospice]]s governed by a small community of monks belonging to different orders, but many of the monasteries of this route have also attached their own hospitals. Here is a list of the most important monasteries of this route:\n\n====Huesca====\n*[[San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]. Affiliated with the [[Aragonese monarchs]] and Navarre.\n\n====Navarra====\n*Leyre Monastery, Benedictine, the focus of the Reconquista and refuge of kings and bishops of Navarre. It has an attached [[guesthouse]] for pilgrims.\n*Convento de Santo Domingo ([[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]]), foundation of Theobald II of Navarre in 1259.\n*Monastery of Our Lady the Royal Irache, which is not along the road's route but in a detour from [[Ayegui]]. It is one of the oldest Benedictine monasteries in Navarre; it is possibly of Visigoth design. The hospital was founded by [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre]] in 1051.\n\n====La Rioja====\n*Convent of San Anton in [[Navarrete, La Rioja|Navarrete]], of which only ruins remain.\n*Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de N\u00e1jera, founded by [[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n]] along with a hospital for pilgrims. Alfonso VI joined the monastery at Cluny in 1079, to promote the pilgrimage, in opposition to the bishop of N\u00e1jera who moved to [[Calahorra]] in protest. This monastery is the tomb of the [[kings of Navarre]]. It has been run by Franciscan friars since 1895.\n*Ca\u00f1as Monastery (home of [[Santo Domingo de Silos]]). Female Cistercian abbey founded in 1170.\n\n====Burgos====\n*Monastery of San F\u00e9lix de Oca on the hill of [[San Felices]] which dates from the ninth century. In 1049, it was annexed to [[San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla]]. According to tradition, Diego Porcelos, the founder of the city of Burgos, is buried here. The apse is the only remaining structure from this monastic community.\n*Monastery of San Juan de Ortega. [[San Juan de Ortega]] founded this place to resemble a pilgrims' hospital rather than a monastery. In 1170, Alfonso VIII relinquished the hospital to the jurisdiction of Burgos, and in 1432 the Church of Burgos took over the Order of St. Jerome.\n*Monastery of [[San Juan Evangelista]], outside of Burgos, a former hospital complex that Alfonso VI began in 1091 under the protection of the Benedictine Abbey of [[Chaise-Dieu]] in the [[Haute-Loire]], with San Lesmes as prior. Only the chapter house and cloister remain of the monastery, while only the facade remains of the church convent.\n*Monastery of las Huelgas, which ran the King's Hospital, founded by Alfonso VI on behalf of the pilgrims.\n*The Benedictine monastery of Rocamador was dependent on donations and privileges granted by [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. It was founded to assist pilgrims with a difficult passage between Hornillos del Camino to [[Castrojeriz]].\n*Convent of San Ant\u00f3n de Castrojeriz. This convent was founded by [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] in 1146 for the [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony|Order of St. Anthony]], of French origin. The monastery had been reduced to ruins in the fourteenth century with the exception of a [[Gothic arch]] to the left of the great portal, under which the road passed.\n*The Cistercian monastery of Castrojeriz emerged in conjunction with the Pilgrims' Hospital founded by Count [[Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara]] and his wife Teresa. It was near the Fitero Bridge (Pons Fiteria) the river [[Pisuerga]].\n\n====Palencia====\n\n*The Benedictine monastery, founded by the lady Mayor in 1035 in the town of [[Fr\u00f3mista]], of which remains only the church of San Mart\u00edn, a good example of the Romanesque architecture of the twelfth century.\n*Monastery of Santa Clara ([[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]]), founded in the thirteenth century.\n*Former [[Abbey of Santa Maria de Benev\u00edvere]], twelfth century. Only ruins remain.\n*Monastery of San Zoilo, on the Carri\u00f3n river near Carri\u00f3n de los Condes, a great center of refuge for pilgrims; the tombs of the Infantes of Carri\u00f3n are located here.\n*Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de las Tiendas, also founded in the eleventh century, belonging to the [[order of Santiago]], near Tiendas. Only vestiges of the monastery remain, which the present farmhouse incorporates.\n\n====Leon====\n*Monastery of San Benito el Real de Sahagun, whose Cluniac monks arrived in 1080. This was the main [[abbey]] on the peninsula, which expanded to 60 beds for pilgrims in their own hospital.\n*Monastery of San Agustin in [[Mansilla de las Mulas]], disappeared, leaving only the Arco de San Agust\u00edn near Pilgrim Street.\n\n====Lugo====\n*Samos Monastery, Benedictine, with a shelter for pilgrims of high rank. The masses were housed in separate houses of the abbey.\n*Monastery of la Magdalena, in [[Sarria]], founded by two Italian priests of the Order of St. Augustine. As of 2007, this monastery is in charge of priests belonging to the Orden de la Merced, and as is traditional, welcome pilgrims. Their adjunct hospital had a reputation for caring for pilgrims.\n*Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Loio, in the small village of Loio Lugo. The hermit dwelling was restored by a monk named Limerick. It was the birthplace of the [[Knights of Santiago]] to 1170. Almost no traces of its original location remain.\n*Monastery of Villar de Donas, past a place called Ligond\u00e9, it is necessary to deviate from the road to get here. It was originally a small convent for members of the Arias family of [[Monterroso]] and in 1184 belonged to the Order of Santiago. In 2007, only the church, which houses paintings from the fourteenth century, remains standing.\n\n====La Coru\u00f1a====\n*[[Monastery of San Mart\u00edn Pinario]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], former Benedictine monastery, now a major seminary.\n*[[Saint John of Caaveiro|Caaveiro Monastery]], in the [[Fragas do Eume]].\n*Monastery of Sancti Spiritus ([[Melide, A Coru\u00f1a|Melide]]) at the front entrance to the Melide Hospital. All that remains is the Romanesque church of Santa Maria, which dates from the eighth century, and is the current parish.\n*Augustinian Convent ([[Arz\u00faa]]) with its own hospital in the town of Arz\u00faa; all that remains is church of the Magdalene and part of the fabric of the hospital.\n\n===Palaces in monasteries===\n\nThe royal [[palace]] in this institution is one of the characteristics of the Spanish monastery.\n\nOccasionally, already constructed buildings were willingly converted into a palace. Such is the case of Tordesillas, [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]] and Paular. In other instances, the monastery offered a residence to the king or the nobility when they traveled for matters relating to their own Reconquista or to follow the travels of the courts of Castile and Aragon. In some monasteries the palatial residence required building a new building inside the compound, as in the monasteries of Poblet, [[Carracedo]] and [[Yuste]]. The monastery of [[El Escorial]] was conceived from the beginning with a specific architecture and set of structures to house the monks and the king and his court.\n\n===Monasteries as palaces===\n\nMany Spanish monasteries were built from scratch in order to house the [[tomb]]s of royal families or members of the nobility. To this end, the patrons made large donations of land, money and men. During the Middle Ages and the [[Renaissance]], it was considered of vital importance that the monks keep in their prayers the memory of the dead buried near them in churches, cloisters, or cemeteries, and not only consider this important for the salvation of souls but as a perpetual reminder to future generations how important those buried were. Among the great monasteries which possessed noble or royal [[mausoleum]]s are:\n\n*[[San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]] and San Pedro el Viejo in [[Huesca]], in which are buried the kings of Aragon until Aragon joined Catalonia. In the aforementioned monastery, kings of [[kingdom of Pamplona]] are buried, when the territory was part of Navarre.\n*[[Santes Creus]] and Poblet, kings of the Crown of Aragon.\n*[[Ripoll Monastery|Ripoll]], with the counts of [[Barcelona]], before its union with Aragon.\n*[[Najera Monastery|Najera]] and Leyre, monasteries elected by the dynasties of Navarra.\n*[[San Isidoro de Le\u00f3n]], at which are buried many of the Kings of Leon.\n*[[San Salvador de O\u00f1a]] (Burgos), converted into a county and regional cemetery in the second half of the twelfth century.\n*[[Abbey of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Las Huelgas|Las Huelgas Reales de Burgos]], chosen by the Castilian monarchs.\n*Cartuja de Miraflores at Burgos, where [[Juan II of Castile]] chose to be buried, along with his second wife and his son Alfonso.\n*The Salesians in Madrid, where lies [[Fernando VI]] (the founder) and his wife [[Barbara of Braganza]].\n*El Escorial, considered as a prototype for the funeral aspects, but is the most modern of all. There are the mausoleums of the royal families of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].\n*[[San Rom\u00e1n de Hornija]], in Valladolid, which was originally a monastery founded by Chindasvinto Visigoth for his own burial and his wife Reciberga (or Reciwerga).\n\nAmong the monasteries, cemeteries and burial of the family of the nobility, there are:\n\n*[[Loeches]] Monastery where are buried the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]] and his descendants the Dukes of Alba. This is a side chapel.\n*San Francisco de Guadalajara, where the Dukes of Infantado built a [[crypt]].\n*San Jer\u00f3nimo de Granada, whose founder, Grand Master, declined to be buried there.\n*[[San Jer\u00f3nimo de Cotalba]] in [[Alfahuir]], (Valencia), in which are buried the Infantes Don Juan and Do\u00f1a Blanca de Arag\u00f3n.\n*Monastery of Parral in [[Segovia]], which holds the tomb of the Marquis de Villena.\n*Monastery of Santa Paula in [[Seville]], with the Marquis de Montemayor.\n*[[Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de N\u00e1jera]], which has an important pantheon of the Knights.\n*Porta Coeli monastery in Valladolid, in which is buried its promoter and benefactor [[Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n, Count of Oliva]], favorite of the [[Duke of Lerma]].\n*Monastery of San Pedro de Cardena, where [[El Cid]] was buried and where his wife and daughters took refuge during his exile). In the [[Spanish War of Independence|War of Independence]], the monastery was sacked by the French army and his grave desecrated.\n\n===Monasteries (or convents) as a learning center===\n\nSome religious communities have [[education]] as their main activity. The agencies and the religious way of life is no different from other monasteries, only instead of cultivating the land, their work is channeled to instruction and education. Examples of such religious houses are the Convent of Santo Domingo as the [[University of Orihuela]] (known as the Colegio de Santo Domingo) and the convent of San Esteban de Murcia.\n\nThe major universities ([[University of Salamanca]], [[Universidad de Valladolid]] and [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]) were closely linked to the regular clergy by religious orders who controlled their schools, mostly Dominicans and Augustinians, and the Jesuits from the sixteenth century. In [[college town|university town]]s, there were important monastic or conventual foundations, such as the Dominican Convent of San Esteban de Salamanca.\n\n===Urbanised Monasteries or Convents===\n\nSome monasteries and convents are located within developed areas; these tend to belong to the so-called mendicant orders, but should not be taken as a general rule. Occasionally, religious houses were built adjacent to communities, neither inside the community or in the countryside, such as Benedictines and Cistercians, and occasionally small [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]s.\n\nThese urban monasteries are similar to traditional monasteries but have their own architectural characteristics. The buildings are not in most cases surrounded by a wall or fence that isolates, the only walls being those that encircle the [[garden]] or [[orchard]]. The windows look out onto the streets of the city so it is necessary to protect those inside with blinds. Secular residents of the surrounding community have direct access to the building of the church inside of which there is a closed off area for the monks or nuns. Inside the church, the [[pulpit]] becomes a central element because these congregations have as a main goal to instruct and speak directly to the faithful.\n\nThere are other elements that distinguish convents from monasteries Female convents there are other elements that characterize them, as the existence of a wheel, the only element of contact the religious residents of the community have with the outside. The church building sometimes has an elevated choir and a choir under the feet or a choir under the side of the [[chancel]], separated by a communion rail.\n\nMost of these urban monasteries proliferated during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout the Spanish territory.\n\n===Decline of the Spanish monasteries===\n\nMany of the Hispanic monasteries were abandoned, forgotten and lost, over time. The medieval monasteries were maintained, although some were plundered and burned, to recover from these tragedies only with new reconstructions.\n\nThe nineteenth century was crucial for the conservation of these monastic buildings. The Spanish War of Independence brought many calamities; French soldiers were quartered in the buildings in some cases the churches were turned into stables or kitchens. Fires were set for heating and cooking, with the inevitable consequences. Many of the tombs were desecrated in search of possible treasures or for the mere pleasure of destroying, apart from [[robbery]] and [[theft]] of works of art in wartime. In some cases, it was believed that the destruction would bring about [[social transformation]], as was the case with the demolition of thirty-seven convents in [[Madrid]] and the convent of San Francisco (Valladolid).\n\nAfter years of peace, and of building restoration and recovery of scattered pieces, monasteries were again involved in the events of the [[Carlist Wars]], the identification of the [[Carlist]] and the clergy, most notably the burning of convents and monasteries in 1835, which included a [[massacre]] of monks. Finally, in this century, the various [[confiscation]]s ended with the realized heritage of most medieval monasteries. Many of their churches were spared because they took on a new life by becoming parishes. In some cases, other provincial institutions and individuals came forward to museums with recovered pieces, including parts of the churches' architecture. The monastic ruins went on to become a commonplace instance of [[romanticism]], and poets and musicians seeking inspiration in them; notable artists include [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[George Sand]] in the [[Valldemossa Charterhouse|Cartuja de Valldemossa]] and the B\u00e9cquer brothers [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer|Gustavo]] and [[Valeriano B\u00e9cquer|Valeriano]] in the Cistercian Monastery [[Veruela Abbey|Veruela]] (Zaragoza).\n\nIn the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the Restoration, there was a [[political climate]] more favorable to the founding of new religious orders and the restoration of the old. Some monasteries were able to revive the monastic life.\n\nIn the first third of the twentieth century, political and social critical junctures brought back to light the old Spanish [[anticlericalism]] which culminated in [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in Barcelona in 1909. In 1910, the Law of the lock prevented the establishment of new religious congregations. In 1931, shortly after the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], came a new burning of convents, but much more serious was the destruction during the [[Spanish Civil War]], with thousands of victims among the clergy.\n\nIn the last quarter century, both the Spanish state and companies became aware of the great ruined monastic heritage was lost, great buildings abandoned or poorly maintained but still remained standing part of its [[architecture]] and began the quest to give them a meaning and relevance, such as rehabilitation for [[museum]]s, cultural centers, or schools.\n\n==The architectural complex of Spanish monasteries==\n\nThe monastery and its dependencies eventually consolidated with the Benedictine Order of Cluny in Romanesque period in the [[early Middle Ages]]. The monks of Cluny spread throughout [[Europe]] and founded the monasteries whose architectural structure would henceforth be an example to follow, with minor variations in some monastic orders, taking into account possible regional differences.\n\n===External Signs of buildings===\n\nIn many monasteries and convents it was traditional to construct a transept and small chapels that served as a shrine, located in the vast expanse of the garden. [[Fountain]]s and [[water well|well]]s which is usually open in the center or side of the courtyard.\n\nA common image was that of the [[patron saint]] of the warrant or the title holder of the church. Sometimes the title is kept original to the foundation of the monastery and sometimes switches to receive the relics of a saint local or foreign.\n\nSculptural decoration shields were common, signifying the monastic order as appropriate, those of kings or noble founders or sponsors, [[bishop]]s (where applicable) and the arms of the city. It is also common to see figures representing the founder.\n\nAn important addition is the tower or steeple with a bell serving as the municipal clock. The language of the bells was very important during the Middle Ages and Renaissance as well as representing the time, as was the town crier announcing events.\n\n===The church===\n\nThe churches of the monasteries have some features that differentiate them from those of [[secular clergy]], especially in regard to the chorus, [[Vestry|vestries]] and penitential cells. In all other respects, they follow the same rules and practice space is dedicated to the [[liturgy]], with the center of spiritual life and religious communities.\n\nChurches are always oriented to the east, like other Christian churches (except in cases where the place names force a placement). Its plan is a Latin cross [[transept]] and [[apse]] or apses. They usually have three gates: the main foot, which gives access to outdoor and one in the side wall to access the cloister, used exclusively by the monks, and a third located in the transept, which leads to the sacristy.\n\n====Side chapels and shrines====\n\nMonasteries placed several chapels or simple [[altar]]s in small spaces due to the requirement that the monks had to say daily Mass each. However, in the convents, this need did not exist because there was only one [[chaplain]] for the entire community. This reasoning applies to the [[sacristy]], which were more spacious in monasteries than convents.\n\n====Presbytery====\n\nThe altar would be placed in this part of the church. Placement of the altar was usually connected with a sculpture of the patron saint of the monastery. In some religious houses, this image is tucked into a niche suitable for pilgrims to visit, such as the monastery of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].\n\n====Choir====\n\nThe choir was customarily located in the middle of the nave in the Spanish monasteries, separated from the chancel by the transept. It might also be located in the apse behind the main altar, surrounded by a circular wall. The choir in the middle of the church is an enclosed space that is usually surrounded by a screen. Inside, it is furnished with seating with ornamentation used to instruct artists. Both armrests and backs are profusely decorated with carvings that are iconographic animal symbols, [[mythology]], [[Allegory|allegories]], genre scenes and so on. In the center of the choir is lectern furniture that supports the great liturgical [[choral music]] book, written in large characters that can be read from afar by the monks. The organ was placed in a lateral.\n\n===The cloister===\n\nThe quintessential medieval Spanish cloister is the Benedictine whose pattern spread throughout Christian Europe. Its construction consists of four galleries called ''pandas'', one of them  attached to the south or north nave of the church. One gallery is dedicated always to the chapter house and another small unit. The west gallery houses usually the cilla and laymen, and the gallery border to the church has the refectory and kitchen calefactory. In some monasteries, the profundis room is replaced by the refectory where the monks chant [[Psalm]]\n\"De profundis ad te Dominum clamavi ...\"\n[[Psalm 130]] (129)\n\n===Infirmaries, herbal medicine and herb garden===\n\nOne of Saint Benedict's foremost edicts concerned caring for the ill indigent residents around the monasteries. To this end, the monasteries established hospitals both inside the monastery grounds and elsewhere in the community. Inside the monastery, there was an infirmary which treated the friars themselves and on occasion, ill visitors. As a complement to this infirmary, monasteries often had stores of herbal or botanic medicines, supplied by the monastery's garden. In some cases, this infirmary and associated medical stores might expand beyond the needs of the monastery and the surrounding community. This is true of the monastery of [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey|Santo Domingo de Silos]], which was founded in 1705 at the request of the town of [[Santo Domingo de Silos|Silos]]. It became a famous chemist and recognized in the region, which is today quite well preserved; it is a museum for those who wish to study what these infirmaries were like. One particular display is that of a collection of jars produced in [[Talavera de la Reina]], for the center, with the coat of arms of the monastery.\n\nThere are many documents about these aromatic gardens cultivated by the monks. In the monastery of Santa Maria de Matallana in the province of Valladolid, reconstruction of the ruins revealed the space that monks had devoted to this garden, growing plants. Another major herbarium was the monastery of San Juli\u00e1n de Samos in the province of [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]].\n\nThe [[Apothecary|apothecaries]] were served by the monks, themselves specialized. They carried out all relevant tasks for the manufacture of [[medicine]]s, [[ointment]]s, and spirits both medicinal and otherwise. Many of these pharmacies have conserved tools such as the stills used for [[distillation]].\n\n===Scriptorium and library===\n\nIn the High and [[Late medieval|Late Medieval]] period, much learning and literature was in the hands of the monasteries. It was there that knowledge was preserved, books were copied and translations made. Many of these monasteries had a [[scriptorium]] in addition to a library, furnished with benches, desks and shelves and equipped with pens, parchment, inks and other tools needed for writing and painting miniatures. Judging by the illuminated manuscripts preserved in Catalonia, there is evidence that desks were abundant. The Royal Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Vallbona had not only a significant library but some furniture of the period.\n\nThe library of the monastery of [[Montserrat]] has 400 incunabula, despite the ravages of time, and the [[Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda]] in Aragon still retains its scriptorium space.\n\nAnother significant library of the period was that of [[Santa Mar\u00eda de Huerta]], Soria, built in the twelfth century and decorated in the seventeenth. In the monastery of [[Valvanera]], the rich library survives, in which there are records which refer to the Polyglot Bible Valvanera, which [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] removed to [[El Escorial]] where it was destroyed in a fire. In Galicia, the famous monastery of San Juli\u00e1n de Samos had a great library that was burned in a fire in the late twentieth century.\n\n===Cemetery for monks===\n\nUsually the monks were buried in the cloisters' crypt. The Cistercian monks were buried directly in the ground (without a [[coffin]]) and face down. The abbots were buried in the chapter house.\n\n===Other units===\n\nOne of the most important areas in a monastery is the [[garden]], large or small. It supplied both food and a place for monks to come do penance or for spiritual retreats. The large monasteries had similarly large gardens with all kinds of facilities, from fountains, [[canal]]s and wells. In some minor orders, the gardens had simply small chapels or [[oratory (worship)|oratories]].\n\nSometimes [[inn]]s were built outside the closure area. Over time and with the growing authority of the abbot, the religious houses were  wont to build their own house, where the abbot might receive important guests.\n\nLarger monasteries provided not only the means for the monks' subsistence but for a strong local economic base, with workshops, foundries, mills, potteries, wineries, and other small businesses.\n\n==Heritage==\n\nDespite the great vicissitudes suffered by the Spanish monasteries\u2014fire, theft, plundering, confiscations, laziness\u2014there still remains still a considerable heritage of artistic furnishings.\n\nThe monasteries tried to move away from the heritage of austerity required of [[Asceticism|ascetics]], without exhibiting any external signs of wealth. Maintaining this position was virtually impossible because of the desire of lay founders, sponsors and donors that their gifts be visible as indications of their power, generosity and position. All these monasteries developed a rich collection of art, and this display did not escape the strictest order in this regard, the [[Carthusian Order]].\n\nIn the Renaissance and [[Baroque period]], the great chapel altars and those of smaller subsidiary chapels, following the new concept of post-Counter liturgical life. Thus arose the sculpted altarpieces, such as that by [[Dami\u00e1n Forment]] in the monastery of Poblet, which resulted in such an extravagant expenditure that the monks rebelled against the abbot. Another example of a huge altarpiece was in the monastery of San Benito el Real de Valladolid, a masterpiece of [[Alonso Berruguete|Berruguete Alonso]], which is kept at present at the [[National Museum of Sculpture (Valladolid)|National Museum of Sculpture]] in the city.\n\nThe vestries were enriched not only with the necessary furniture but adorned with works of famous painters, often in valuable frames. Also paintings of kings and nobility often hung on the walls of the churches or cloisters as symbols of or to attract their patronage.\n\nMany monasteries have liturgical pieces, and large pieces of [[jewelry]] displayed in glass cases along with textile items, such as vestments and clothing. Some monasteries are by themselves a veritable museum of art, like the Descalzas Real in Madrid. Others have opened up within its walls (taking advantage of old farms) where to place a museum and recovered missing pieces, such is the case of Poblet whose museum occupies the area that was the Palace of King [[Martin the Humane]] in Poblet. Counted among their treasure are valuable books.\n\n==Some notable monasteries==\n\nSome monasteries have historical significance or are simply interesting. The short listing here does not imply that these monasteries are the best or most important, but simply interesting histories.\n\n===Monastery of San Benito el Real de Sahag\u00fan===\n\nThis monastery was important enough that it was referred to as the Spanish Cluny. It was the most powerful and influential Benedictine monastery of the Middle Ages in the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]]. It was protected and promoted by King Alfonso VI which, among other privileges granted to preserve the protected [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Urraca]] also gave the monastery the right to mint its own currency and the Jews of the town as vassals by King Alfonso VII. Its heritage spanned the provinces of Le\u00f3n, Valladolid, Palencia, [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]] and Cantabria, thus counting a far larger number of subjects under their jurisdiction than the holdings of other important figures of the time. From the religious point of view, Sahagun was the center from which sprang at the behest of Pope Gregory VII the new Roman liturgy which replaced Spanish [[Mozarabic Rite]]. Father Sandoval and Father Yepes listed fifty to sixty monasteries and a large number of churches which depended on Sahag\u00fan. The monastery's influence stretched from Toledo and from Cantabria Rioja to Galicia.\n\n===Monastery of San Benito el Real Valladolid===\n\nIts founding in 1389 brought a new reform of the Benedictine order under the royal protection of [[Juan I of Castile|Juan I]] and the blessing of [[Pope Clement VII]]; the \"black monks\" had relaxed their strictures, forgetting Saint Benedict's strictures so far as to sleep outside the monasteries. This monastery instilled its members with a respect for the example of Saint Benedict. The cloister was the property of the monastery, not only from the spiritual perspective but the physical, with a double gate installed in the entries. The principle was established with toughness and authority of perpetual abstinence, fasting and severity in the monk's practice and in their habitations; it also enforced generosity to the needy in the form of sharing food, money and fuel. Valladolid took the lead in the fifteenth century reforms of the Benedictine orders in Spain, and other Benedictine monasteries became dependent on it Valladolid, as did the Congregation of San Benito de Valladolid, after the papal bull of [[Pope Alexander VI]]. To this end, many chapters drafted the relevant constitutions.\n\n===Monastery of Poblet===\n\nPoblet was founded by the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV. It was one of the four great Cistercian abbeys of [[Christendom]], along with Clairvaux, in Absinthe, France; the Great Forest, in Languedoc; and Fontfreda, near Narbonne). In 1340, Peter ordered the crypts for royalty and nobility to be created, which became an important center for burial. The abbots of Poblet became a very powerful part of the clergy who participated in [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]]; one abbot even became president of the Generalitat. The involvement of the abbots in Catalan wars became apparent.\n\n===Monastery of La Rabida===\nThis is a Franciscan monastery in the town of [[Palos de la Frontera]], in Huelva province. This was an important place in the history of Spain since its participation in the negotiations which took place between the friars and Fray Antonio de Marchena Friar Juan Perez and Colon during the four visits he made. The monks helped and supported Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs, and as such the monastery is part of what is termed \"Columbus's Places\" in Andalusia.\n\n===Monastery of San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla===\n\nIn this small and humble monastery were first written the annotations or glosses called Emilian Glosses written in \"romance\", a little- studied form of Castilian derived from Latin, and two or three in [[Euskera]]. It is considered the cradle of these languages.\n\n===Monastery of Guadalupe===\n\nIt had a famous scriptorium which produced a series of illuminated books, many of which are preserved in the museum of the monastery. The medieval image of the Virgin of Guadalupe which was taken by the discoverers of [[Extremadura]] to the Americas. This images is particularly venerated in Mexico.\n\nMany well known historical figures passed through the monastery as pilgrims: [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], King [[Sebastian of Portugal]], [[Teresa de Jesus Buenfil]], [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] (in 1982.)\n\n===Monastery of Santo Toribio de Liebana===\n\nFounded in the sixth century in the Cantabrian region of [[Li\u00e9bana]], this monastery held from the eighth century a relic of the [[True Cross]], supposedly the largest fragment preserved. At the same time, the monk [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] wrote two works of great significance: the Commentary on Revelation, of which several valuable illuminated illustrated copies are held, and the refutation of heresy that had spread among Mozarabic Christians under Muslim occupation and [[Elipando]], bishop of Toledo. The monastery regularly celebrated a Jubilee or Holy Year Liebana.\n\n===Monastery of San Salvador de Tabara===\n\nThis was a two-part monastery of monks and nuns in the Visigothic tradition, founded by [[Froila (Bishop of Lugo)|Abbot Froila]], under the patronage of Alfonso III and located 43&nbsp;km northeast of Zamora. The excavations brought to light two columnar towers and an arch that led to the lower room of the tower. In this tower was the scriptorium where the monk Emeterio finished illuminating the Beatus miniatures Tabara, initiated by his master, Magio. Emeterio himself writes the following account:\n\n\"Oh T\u00e1bara tower, high tower of stone! It's there in the top and into the first room of the library, where sat Emeterio and hunched over his homework, over 3 months, and all the members crippled by the work of the pen. 52 was finished this book 6 of the Kalends of August, the year 1008 was Hispanic, 53 to the facet hour.\"\n\nThis phrase, along with an illustration of the tower workplace, have been highly valued for depicting how such work was in the monasteries.\n\n===Monastery of El Palancar===\nFounded by [[San Pedro de Alcantara]] Acim Pedroso ([[C\u00e1ceres (province)]]) in 1557, this was considered the world's smallest religious house. Subsequently extended, it retained the original area under the name of the convent. In a tiny space, were built several structures  a chapel for the offices large enough to fit only the officiant and an acolyte, to which is attached the founder's cell, which describes [[Santa Teresa de Jes\u00fas]] this way:\nIt seems they were forty years, he told me he had slept one hour and a half between night and day, and it was the greatest work of penance that had in the early to beat the dream and it was always or kneeling or standing. I was sitting and sleeping head leaning against a maderillo he had driven into the wall. Lying, even if I wanted, I could not because his cell as we know, was not longer than four feet and a half.\n\n===Monastery of El Escorial===\nDesigned to be not only a monastery but a royal residence and as a pantheon of kings of the houses of Austria and Bourbon. It is a monastery known and admired worldwide. Herrera architecture was revolutionary in Spanish art, and El Escorial retains great treasures and its library and art gallery spaces are considered to hold very rich and valuable collections.\n\n===Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen===\nLocated in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] mountain range near Madrid, this led in the years after its building to a great social impact, not only by the vast proportion its construction but its later role in burials.\n\n==Spanish monasteries in the 21st century==\n\nMany monasteries have crumbled over the centuries, leaving no trace of their existence. However, some may be described by researchers who have access to related documents. In some cases, these documents only speak of history, but in other cases, contracts or purchases remain fairly accurately related to the buildings. A large number of the monasteries have only the church as a witness of the complex that might be. At other times, ruins remain which are being transformed to a fruitful use. Occasionally buildings which remained intact over the centuries have been converted into a hotel, a school or a restaurant. In none of these cases, has the modern business retained the property the garden or nearby buildings.\n\nAlso many of these medieval monasteries have regained their original function and survive as a community of monks or nuns. In the absence of patronage and custom or donations, these religious people adapt to modern life with modern media and subsist on the work undertaken by the community's members: confectionery, wine and spirits, cheese, bee hives, poultry farms, textiles and fiber arts, writing scores, dissertations, obituaries, advanced computing, pottery of all kinds, decorated white porcelain, artisanal food, farming, vestments, textiles, caring for sick and elderly, schools and daycare.\n\nIn addition, about 250 monasteries have a guest house for lay people who must follow some basic rules, with minimal cost.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504184948/http://www.patrimonionacional.es/monast.htm Monasterios y Conventos reales en Espa\u00f1a] (web del Patromonio Nacional espa\u00f1ol)\n* [http://www.catolicos.com/monasteriosespana.htm Monasterios cat\u00f3licos en Espa\u00f1a en la actualidad]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504184948/http://www.patrimonionacional.es/monast.htm Monasteries and Convents in Spain] (Spanish National official World Heritage Site website)\n* [http://www.catolicos.com/monasteriosespana.htm Catholic Monasteries in Spain at the moment] (Catholic site)\n\n{{Architecture of Spain}}\n\n[[Category:Religion in Spain]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures in Spain]]\n[[Category:Monasteries in Spain| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of monasteries|Spain]]\n", "name_user": "Sirbots", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix spacing typo.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monasteries_in_Spain"}

She searches for her brother Finn on the train in a game of Simon says. Afterward, an unnamed person wearing a rabbit mask appears and a panicked Finn tells Scarlett to wake up, making her awaken on the train once more. Unmoving figures who are all wearing animal masks begin to appear. Matching dialogue in the correct order with the masked persons creates vague contexts for the story and allows Scarlett to move onto the next area.\n\nScarlett begins to be unsure of her surroundings, as areas such as her grandpa's greenhouse and her treehouse shared with her brother begin to materialize and branch out of areas of the train. Throughout her journey, she develops the ability to \"give life\" to objects and control fire while also encountering a dark substance called Umbra, which seems to hate light.\n\nAfter a few puzzles, Finn will become angry at Scarlett, saying that Scarlett left him and that Scarlett should never have left him alone. Scarlett can either choose to transfer fire out of their treehouse or transfer fire into their treehouse, creating a sense of catharsis or a sense of redemption in the dialogue between Finn and Scarlett that end with Finn and Scarlett forgiving each other for prior grievances. Scarlett then wakes up once more but on the shore by a body of water with Finn and a makeshift raft. Finn asks Scarlett to fix up 'Finnland' by finding objects to spruce up the place. After fixing Finnland, the rabbit masked figure appears and leads Scarlett through a tunnel that takes her back to the treehouse and then the train, and then returning to Finnland.\n\nAfter dialogue with the masked figures while dealing with the Umbra, Scarlett realizes that Finn died in an accident when Scarlett was out on a date (implying that she was interacting with Finn's spirit this entire time). This takes Scarlett and Finn back to the treehouse and leads Finn to say he doesn't want to go alone because he does not remember what their parents, who died long ago, look like. Scarlett draws a picture of what their mom looks like and attaches it onto one of the figures, who transforms into their mom after Scarlett uses magic. Scarlett says her goodbyes and Finn and their parents walk away into the moonlight of the treehouse deck, fading away in the form of luminescent butterflies. Scarlett then wakes up back on the train, which had just arrived at a station (which implies that her entire journey was just a dream). The story ends with Scarlett noticing an animal mask nearby, which is the same mask worn by the mother figure.\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe game was the first console/PC game developed by indie studio

She searches for her brother Finn on the train in a game of Simon says. Afterward, an unnamed person wearing a rabbit mask appears and a panicked Finn tells Scarlett to wake up, making her awaken on the train once more. Unmoving figures who are all wearing animal masks begin to appear. Matching dialogue in the correct order with the masked persons creates vague contexts for the story and allows Scarlett to move onto the next area.\n\nScarlett begins to be unsure of her surroundings, as areas such as her grandpa's greenhouse and her treehouse shared with her brother begin to materialize and branch out of areas of the train. Throughout her journey, she develops the ability to \"give life\" to objects and control fire while also encountering a dark substance called Umbra, which seems to hate light.\n\nAfter a few puzzles, Finn will become angry at Scarlett, saying that Scarlett left him and that Scarlett should never have left him alone. Scarlett can either choose to transfer fire out of their treehouse or transfer fire into their treehouse, creating a sense of catharsis or a sense of redemption in the dialogue between Finn and Scarlett that end with Finn and Scarlett forgiving each other for prior grievances. Scarlett then wakes up once more but on the shore by a body of water with Finn and a makeshift raft. Finn asks Scarlett to fix up 'Finnland' by finding objects to spruce up the place. After fixing Finnland, the rabbit masked figure appears and leads Scarlett through a tunnel that takes her back to the treehouse and then the train, and then returning to Finnland.\n\nAfter dialogue with the masked figures while dealing with the Umbra, Scarlett realizes that Finn died in an accident when Scarlett was out on a date (implying that she was interacting with Finn's spirit this entire time). This takes Scarlett and Finn back to the treehouse and leads Finn to say he doesn't want to go alone because he does not remember what their parents, who died long ago, look like. Scarlett draws a picture of what their mom looks like and attaches it onto one of the figures, who transforms into their mom after Scarlett uses magic. Scarlett says her goodbyes and Finn and their parents walk away into the moonlight of the treehouse deck, fading away in the form of luminescent butterflies.

The state ideology of the Soviet Union\u2014and thus Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2014derived and developed from the theories, policies and political praxis of [[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]].\n\nAll Communism sucks.\n\n==Concepts==\n\n===Dictatorship of the proletariat===\n{{main|Dictatorship of the proletariat}}\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| bgcolor = ivory\n| quote = Either the dictatorship of the landowners and capitalists, or the dictatorship of the proletariat [...] There is no middle course [...] There is no middle course anywhere in the world, nor can there be.\n| source = \u2014Lenin, claiming that people had only two choices; a choice between two different, but distinct class dictatorships.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=154\u2013155}}\n}}\n\nLenin, according to his interpretation of [[Marx's theory of the state]], believed [[democracy]] to be unattainable anywhere in the world before the proletariat seized power.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=154\u2013155}} According to Marxist theory, the state is a vehicle for oppression and is headed by a [[ruling class]],{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=154\u2013155}} an \"organ of class rule\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/|title=The State and Revolution|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]|year=1918|isbn=|volume=25 (Collected Works)|location=|publication-date=1999|pages=|chapter=Class Society and the State|author-link=Vladimir Lenin|access-date=10 February 2018|chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210203232/https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch01.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210203232/https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch01.htm|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He believed that by his time, the only viable solution was dictatorship since the war was heading into a final conflict between the \"progressive forces of socialism and the degenerate forces of capitalism\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=155}} The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was already a failure according to its original aim, which was to act as an inspiration for a world revolution.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=155}} As a result, the initial [[anti-statist]] posture and the active campaigning for [[direct democracy]] was replaced with dictatorship.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=155}} From the perspective of the Bolsheviks, the rationale for this change was Russia's lack of development, its status as the sole socialist state in the world, its encirclement by imperialist powers, and its internal encirclement by the peasantry.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=156}}\n\nMarx, similar to Lenin, considered it fundamentally irrelevant whether a bourgeois state was ruled according to a [[Republicanism|republican]], [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarian]] or [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutionally monarchic]] political system because this did not change the [[mode of production]] itself.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=155\u2013156}} These systems, regardless of whether they are ruled by an oligarchy or by mass participation, were ultimately all a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]] by definition because the bourgeoisie, by the very condition of their class and its interests, would promote and implement policies in their class interests and thus in defense of capitalism.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=157\u2013158}} There was a difference, though; Lenin, after [[revolutions of 1917\u201323|the failures of the world revolutions]], argued that this did not necessarily have to change under the dictatorship of the proletariat.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=158}} The reasoning came from wholly practical considerations: the majority of the country's inhabitants were not communists and the party could not introduce parliamentary democracy since that was inconsistent with their ideology and would lead to the party losing power.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=158}} He therefore concluded that \"[t]he form of government has absolutely nothing do to with\" the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=158}} Bukharin and Trotsky agreed with Lenin, both claiming that the revolution had only destroyed the old, but failing completely in creating anything sort of new.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=158\u2013159}} Lenin had now concluded that the dictatorship of the proletariat would not alter the relationship of power between persons, but rather \"transform their productive relations so that, in the long run, the realm of necessity could be overcome and, with that, genuine social freedom realised\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}}\n\nIt was in the period of 1920\u20131921 that Soviet leaders and ideologists began differentiating between socialism and communism; hitherto the two terms had been used to describe similar conditions.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}} From then, the two terms developed separate meanings. According to Soviet ideology, Russia was in the transition from capitalism to socialism (referred to interchangeably under Lenin as the dictatorship of the proletariat), socialism being the intermediate stage to communism, with the latter being the final stage which follows after socialism.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}} By now, the party leaders believed that universal mass participation and true democracy could only take form in the last stage, if only because of Russia's current conditions at the time.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=ivory|quote=[Because] the proletariat is still so divided, so degraded, so corrupted in parts [...] that an organization taking in the whole proletariat cannot directly exercise proletarian dictatorship. It can be exercised only by a vanguard that has absorbed the revolutionary energy of the class.|source=\u2014 Lenin, explaining the increasingly dictatorial nature of the regime.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=161}}}}\n\nIn early Bolshevik discourse, the term \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was of little significance; the few times it was mentioned, it was likened to the form of government which had existed in the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}} With the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]] and the social and material devastation that followed, however, its meaning was transformed from communal democracy to disciplined totalitarian rule.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=160}} By now, Lenin had concluded that only a proletarian regime as oppressive as its opponents could survive in this world.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=160\u2013161}} The powers previously bestowed upon the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] were now given to the [[Council of People's Commissars]]; the central government was in turn to be governed by \"an army of steeled revolutionary Communists [by Communists he referred to the Party]\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=161}} In a letter to [[Gavril Myasnikov]], Lenin in late 1920 explained his new reinterpretation of the term \"dictatorship of the proletariat\";{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}}\n\n<blockquote>Dictatorship means nothing more nor less than authority untrammelled by any laws, absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever, and based directly on force. The term 'dictatorship' ''has no other meaning but this''.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}}</blockquote>\n\nLenin justified these policies by claiming that all states were class states by nature, and that these states were maintained through [[class struggle]].{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}} This meant that the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union could only be \"won and maintained by the use of violence against the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}} The main problem with this analysis is that the Party came to view anyone opposing or holding alternate views of the party as bourgeoisie.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}} The worst enemy remained the moderates, however, which were \"objectively\" considered to be \"the real agents of the bourgeoisie in the working class movement, the labour lieutenants of the capitalist class\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nConsequently, \"bourgeoisie\" became synonymous with \"opponent\" and with people who disagreed with the party in general.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=163}} These oppressive measures led to another reinterpretation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism in general; it was now defined as a purely economic system.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=165}} Slogans and theoretical works about democratic mass participation and collective decision-making were now replaced with texts which supported authoritarian management.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=165}} Considering the situation, the party believed it has to use the same powers as the bourgeoisie to transform Russia, for there was no other alternative.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=165\u2013166}} Lenin began arguing that the proletariat, similar to the bourgeoisie, did not have a single preference for a form of government, and because of that dictatorship was acceptable to both the party and the proletariat.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=166}} In a meeting with party officials, Lenin stated\u2014in line with his economist view of socialism\u2014that \"[i]ndustry is indispensable, democracy is not\", further arguing that \"we do not promise any democracy or any freedom\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=166}}\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\n{{main|Imperialism}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=Imperialism is capitalism at a stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance-capital is established; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun; in which the divisions of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.|source=\u2014Lenin, citing the main features of capitalism in the age of imperialism in ''Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism''.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=352}}}}\n\nThe Marxist theory on imperialism was conceived by Lenin in his book, ''[[Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (published in 1917).{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=339}} It was written in response to the theoretical crisis within Marxist thought, which occurred due to capitalism's recovery in the 19th century.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=339}} According to Lenin, imperialism was a specific stage of development of capitalism; a stage he referred to as [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=339}} The Marxist movement was split on how to solve capitalism's resurgence and revitalisation after the great depression of the late-19th century.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|pp=344\u2013347}} [[Eduard Bernstein]], from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SDP), considered capitalism' revitalisation as proof that capitalism was evolving into a more humane system, further adding that the basic aims of socialists were not to overthrow the state, but rather to take power through elections.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|pp=344\u2013347}} On the other hand, [[Karl Kautsky]], from the SDP, held a highly [[dogmatism|dogmatic]] view, claiming that there was no crisis within Marxist theory.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|pp=344\u2013347}} Both of them, however, denied or belittled the role of class contradictions in society after the crisis.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|pp=344\u2013347}} In contrast, Lenin believed that capitalism' resurgence was the beginning of a new phase of capitalism; this stage being created because of a strengthening of class contradiction, not because of its reduction.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|pp=344\u2013347}}\n\nLenin did not know when the imperialist stage of capitalism began, and claimed it would be foolish to look for a specific year, however he did assert it began at the beginning of the 20th century (at least in Europe).{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=352}} Lenin believed that the economic crisis of 1900 accelerated and intensified the concentration of industry and banking, which led to the transformation of the finance capital connection to industry into the monopoly of large banks.\"{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=353}} In ''Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', Lenin wrote; \"the twentieth century marks the turning-point from the old capitalism to the new, from the domination of capital in general to the domination of finance capital.\"{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=353}} Lenin's defines imperialism as the monopoly stage of capitalism.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=354}}\n\nDespite radical anti-imperialism being an original core value of Bolshevism, the Soviet Union from 1940 onward was widely viewed as a [[de facto]] imperial power whose ideology could not allow it to admit its own imperialism. Through the Soviet ideological viewpoint, pro-Soviet factions in each country were the only legitimate voice of \"the people\" regardless of whether they were minority factions. All other factions were simply class enemies of \"the people\", inherently illegitimate rulers regardless of whether they were majority factions. Thus, in this view, any country that became Soviet or a Soviet ally naturally did so via a legitimate voluntary desire, even if the requesters needed Soviet help to accomplish it. The principal examples were the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] yielding the annexation of Finnish parts of [[Karelia]], the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the [[occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation of the Baltic states]], and the postwar de facto dominance over the [[satellite state]]s of the [[Eastern Bloc]] under a pretense of total independence. In the [[post-Soviet states|post-Soviet era]] even many Ukrainians, Georgians, and Armenians feel that their countries were forcibly annexed by the Bolsheviks, but this has been a problematic view because the pro-Soviet factions in these societies were once sizable as well. Each faction felt that the other did not represent the [[no true Scotsman|true]] national interest. This [[civil war]]\u2013like paradox has been seen in the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], as pro-Russian Crimeans have been viewed as illegitimate by pro-Ukrainian Crimeans, and vice versa.\n\n===Peaceful coexistence===\n{{main|Peaceful coexistence}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=The loss by imperialism of its dominating role in world affairs and the utmost expansion of the sphere in which the laws of socialist foreign policy operate are  a distinctive feature of the present stage of social development. The main direction of this development is toward even greater changes in the correlation of forces in the world arena in favour of socialism.\"|source=\u2014[[Nikolay Inozemtsev]], a Soviet foreign policy analyst, referring to series of events (which he believed) would lead to the ultimate victory of socialism.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}}}\n\n\"Peaceful coexistence\" was an ideological concept introduced under Khrushchev's rule.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=71}} While the concept has been interpreted by fellow communists as proposing an end to the conflict between the systems of capitalism and socialism, Khrushchev saw it instead as a continuation of the conflict in every area with the exception in the military field.{{sfn|Evans|1993|pp=71\u201372}} The concept claimed that the two systems were developed \"by way of diametrically opposed laws\", which led to \"opposite principles in foreign policy.\"{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}\n\nThe concept was steeped in Leninist and Stalinist thought.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Lenin believed that international politics were dominated by [[class struggle]], and Stalin stressed in the 1940s the growing [[polarization (politics)|polarization]] which was occurring in the capitalist and socialist systems.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Khrushchev's peaceful coexistence was based on practical changes which had occurred; he accused the old \"two camp\" theory of neglecting the [[non-aligned movement]] and the national [[liberation movement]]s.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Khrushchev considered these \"grey areas\", in which the conflict between capitalism and socialism would be fought.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} He still stressed that the main contradiction in international relations were those of capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}  The Soviet Government under Khrushchev stressed the importance of peaceful coexistence, claiming it had to form the basis of Soviet foreign policy.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Failure to do, they believed, would lead to [[nuclear conflict]].{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Despite this, Soviet theorists still considered peaceful coexistence as a continuation of the class struggle between the capitalist and socialist worlds, just not one based on armed conflict.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Khrushchev believed that the conflict, in its current phase, was mainly economical.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}\n\nThe emphasise on peaceful coexistence did not mean that the Soviet Union accepted a static world, with clear lines.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} They continued to upheld the creed that socialism was inevitable, and they sincerely believed that the world had reached a stage in which the \"correlations of forces\" were moving towards socialism.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Also, with the establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and Asia, Soviet foreign policy-planners believed that capitalism had lost its dominance as an economic system.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}\n\n===Socialism in one country===\n{{main|Socialism in One Country}}\n[[File:Stalin-Bukharin (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|The concept of socialism in one country was developed by Bukharin and Stalin]]\nThe concept of \"socialism in one country\" was conceived by Stalin in his struggle against [[Leon Trotsky]] and his concept of [[permanent revolution]].{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=126}} In 1924, Trotsky published his pamphlet ''[[Lessons of October]]'' in which he stated that socialism in the Soviet Union would fail because of the backward state of economic development unless a [[world revolution]] began.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=126}} Stalin responded to Trotsky's pamphlet with his article, \"[[October and Comrade Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution]]\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} In it, Stalin stated, that he did not believe an inevitable conflict between the [[Proletariat|working class]] and the peasants would take place, further adding that \"socialism in one country is completely possible and probable\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} Stalin held the view common amongst most Bolsheviks at the time; there was possibility of real success for socialism in the Soviet Union despite the country's backwardness and international isolation.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} While [[Grigoriy Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], together with Stalin, opposed Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution, they diverged on how socialism could be built.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} According to Bukharin, Zinoviev and Kamenev supported the resolution of the [[14th Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|14th Conference]] (held in 1925) which stated that \"we cannot complete the building of socialism due to our technological backwardness.\"{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} Despite the rather cynical attitude, Zinoviev and Kamenev did believe that a defective form of socialism could be constructed.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} At the 14th Conference, Stalin reiterated his position, claiming that socialism in one country was feasible despite the capitalist blockade of the country.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=128}} After the conference, Stalin wrote \"[[Concerning the Results of the XIV Conference of the RCP(b)]]\", in which he stated that the peasantry would not turn against the socialist system because he believed they had a self-interest in preserving.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=128}} The contradictions which would arise with the peasantry during the socialist transition, Stalin surmised, could \"be overcome by our own efforts\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=128}} He concluded that the only viable threat to socialism in the Soviet Union was a military intervention.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}}\n\nIn late 1925, Stalin received a letter from a party official which stated that his position of \"Socialism in One Country\" was in contradiction with [[Friedrich Engels]] own writings on the subject.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} Stalin countered, stating that Engels' writings 'reflected' \"the era of pre-monopoly capitalism, the pre-imperialist era when there were not yet the conditions of an uneven, abrupt development of the capitalist countries.\"{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} From 1925 onwards, Bukharin began writing extensively on the subject, and in 1926, Stalin wrote ''[[On Questions of Leninism]]'', which contained his best-known writings on the subject.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} Trotsky, with the publishing of ''[[Leninism (book)|Leninism]]'', began countering Bukharin's and Stalin's arguments, claiming that socialism in one country was possible, but only in the short-run, and claimed that without a [[world revolution]] it would be impossible to safeguard the Soviet Union from the \"restoration of [[bourgeoisie]] relations\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} Zinoviev on the other hand, disagreed with both Trotsky and Bukharin and Stalin, holding instead steadfast to Lenin's own position from 1917 to 1922, and continued to claim that only a defecting form of socialism could be constructed in the Soviet Union without a world revolution.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|pp=129\u2013130}} Bukharin, by now, began arguing for the creation of an [[autarkic]] economic model, while Trotsky, in contrast, claimed that the Soviet Union had to participate in the [[international division of labour]] to develop.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=130}} In contrast to Trotsky and Bukharin, Stalin did not believe a world revolution was possible, claiming in 1938 that a world revolution was in fact impossible, and claiming that Engels was wrong on the matter.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} At the [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th Congress]], Stalin took the theory to its inevitable conclusion, claiming that the [[Pure communism|communist mode of production]] could be conceived in one country.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} He rationalised this by claiming that the state could exist in a communist society, as long as the Soviet Union was encircled by capitalism.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} However, surprisingly, with the [[Eastern Bloc|establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe]], Stalin claimed that socialism in one country was only possible in a large country like the Soviet Union, and that the other states, in order to survive, had to follow the Soviet line.{{sfn|van

The [[Soviet Union]]'s ideological commitment to achieving communism included the development [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]] and [[peaceful coexistence]] with [[capitalist countries]] while engaging in [[anti-imperialism]] to defend the international [[proletariat]], combat [[capitalism]] and promote the goals of [[communism]]. The state ideology of the Soviet Union\u2014and thus Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2014derived and developed from the theories, policies and political praxis of [[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]].\n\n==Marxism\u2013Leninism==\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar}}\n{{main|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was the ideological basis for the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=206}} It explained and legitimised the CPSU's right to rule, while explaining its role as a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=206}} For instance, the ideology explained that the CPSU's policies, even if they were unpopular, were correct because the party was enlightened.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=206}} It was represented to be the only truth in Soviet society, and with it rejecting the notion of multiple truths.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=206}} In short, it was used to justify CPSU Leninism as being a means to an end.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=206}} The relationship between ideology and decision-making was at best ambivalent, with most policy decisions taken in the light of the continued, permanent development of Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=212}} Marxism\u2013Leninism, as the only truth, could not by its very nature become outdated.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|p=212}}\n\nDespite having evolved over the years, Marxism\u2013Leninism had several central tenets.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=81}} The main tenet was the party's status as sole ruling party.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=81}} The [[1977 Soviet Constitution|1977 Constitution]] referred to the party as the \"leading and guiding force of Soviet society, and the nucleus of its political system, of all state and public organizations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\"{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=81}} [[State socialism]] was essential, and from [[Joseph Stalin]] until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] official discourse considered private social and economic activity as retarding the development of collective consciousness and of the economy.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} Gorbachev supported [[privatization]] to a degree, but based his policies on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s view on the [[New Economic Policy]] of the 1920s, and supported complete state ownership over the [[commanding heights of the economy]].{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} Unlike [[liberalism]], Marxism\u2013Leninism stressed not the importance of the [[Individualism|individual]], but rather the role of the individual as a member of a [[collective]].{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} Thus defined, individuals had only the right to [[freedom of expression]] if it safeguarded the interests of the collective.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} For instance, in the 1977 Constitution Marxism\u2013Leninism it was stated that every person had the right to express their opinion, but that opinion could only be expressed if it was in accordance with the \"general interests of Soviet society.\"{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} In short, the number of rights granted to an individual was decided by the [[State (polity)|state]], and could be taken away by the state as it saw fit.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} Soviet Marxism\u2013Leninism justified [[nationalism]], and the media portrayed every victory of the Soviet Union as a victory for the [[communism|communist movement]] as a whole.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} In large parts, [[Soviet nationalism]] was based upon ethnic [[Russian nationalism]].{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} Marxism\u2013Leninism stressed the importance of the worldwide conflict between capitalism and socialism, and the Soviet press talked about progressive and reactionary forces, while claiming that [[socialism]] was on the verge of victory; that the \"correlations of forces\" were in the Soviet Union's favour.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=82}} The ideology professed [[state atheism]], and party members were not allowed to be religious.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=83}} The state professed a belief in the feasibility of [[pure communism|communist mode of production]], and all policies were justifiable if it contributed to the Soviet Union's reaching that stage.{{sfn|Sakwa|1990|pp=206\u2013212}}\n\n===Leninism===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nIn [[Marxist philosophy]], Leninism is the body of political theory for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary [[vanguard party]], and the achievement of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], as political prelude to the establishment of the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]], developed by Lenin.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} Since [[Karl Marx]] barely, if ever wrote about how the socialist mode of production would look like or function, these tasks were left for later scholars like Lenin to solve.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} His main contribution to Marxist thought is the concept of the [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] of the [[proletariat|working class]].{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} The vanguard party was conceived to be a highly-knit centralised organization which was led by [[intellectuals]], rather than by the working class itself.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} The party was open only to a small number of the workers, the reason being that the workers in Russia still had not developed [[class consciousness]] and therefore needed to be educated to reach such a state.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} Lenin believed that the vanguard party could initiate policies in the name of the working class even if the working class did not support them, since the vanguard party would know what was best for the workers, since the party functionaries had attained consciousness.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}}\n\nLenin, in light of the [[Marx's theory of the state]] (which views the state as an oppressive organ of the ruling class), had no qualms of forcing change upon the country.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} He viewed the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], in contrast to the [[Bourgeoisie|dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]], as the dictatorship of the majority.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} The repressive powers of the state were to be used to transform the country, and to strip of the former ruling class of their wealth.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} Lenin believed that the transition from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the [[socialist mode of production]] would last for a long period.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=77}} According to some authors, Leninism was by definition authoritarian.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} In contrast to [[Karl Marx]], who believed that the [[socialist revolution]] would be composed of and led by the working class alone, Lenin argued that a socialist revolution did not necessarily need to be led  by or composed of the working class alone, instead contending that a revolution needed to be led by the oppressed classes of society, which in the case of Russia was the peasant class.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=767}}\n\n===Stalinism===\n{{main|Stalinism}}\n[[File:Stalin Image.jpg|thumbnail|While not an ideology ''per se'', Stalinism refers to the thoughts and policies of Stalin]]\nStalinism, while not an ideology ''[[Per se (terminology)|per se]]'', refers to Stalin's thoughts and policies.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=78}} Stalin's introduction of the concept \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" in 1924 was a major turning point in Soviet ideological discourse.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=78}} The Soviet Union did not need a socialist [[world revolution]] to construct a [[Socialism|socialist society]], Stalin claimed.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=78}} Four years later, Stalin initiated his \"Second Revolution\" with the introduction of [[state socialism]] and [[Planned economy|central planning]].{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=78}} In the early-1930s, he initiated [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] of [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|Soviet agriculture]], by de-privatizing agriculture, but not turning it under the responsibility of the state, ''per se'', instead creating peasant cooperatives.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=78}} With the initiation of his \"Second Revolution\", Stalin launched a \"[[Cult of Lenin]]\" and a [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality centered upon himself]].{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=78}} For instance, the name of the city of Petrograd was changed to [[Leningrad]], the town of Lenin's birth was renamed Ulyanov (Lenin's birth-name), the [[Order of Lenin]] became the highest state award and portraits of Lenin were hung up everywhere; in public squares, factories and offices etc.{{sfn|Smith|1991|pp=78\u201379}}  The increasing bureaucracy which followed after the introduction of a state socialist economy was at complete odds with the Marxist notion of \"the withering away of the state\".{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}} Stalin tried to explain the reasoning behind it at the [[16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|16th Congress]] (held in 1930);{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}}\n\n<blockquote>We stand for the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which represents the mightiest and most powerful authority of all forms of State that have ever existed. The highest development of the State power for the withering away of State power \u2014this is the Marxian formula. Is this \"contradictory\"? Yes, it is \"contradictory.\" But this contradiction springs from life itself and reflects completely Marxist dialectic.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}}</blockquote>\n\nThe idea that the state would wither away was later abandoned by Stalin at the [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th Congress]] (held in 1939), in which he expressed confidence that the state would exist, even if the Soviet Union reached communism, as long as it was encircled by capitalism.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} Two key concepts were created in the latter half of his rule; the \"two camp\" theory and that of \"capitalist encirclement\".{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}} The threat of capitalism was used to strengthen Stalin's personal powers, and [[Soviet propaganda]] began making a direct link with Stalin and stability in society, claiming that the country would crumble without the leader.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}} Stalin deviated greatly from [[classical Marxism]] when it came to \"subjective factors\", claiming that party members, whatever rank, had to profess [[fanaticism|fanatic]] adherence to the party's line and ideology, and that otherwise those policies would fail.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}}\n\n===De-Stalinization===\n{{Main|De-Stalinization}}\nAfter Stalin died and once the ensuing power struggle subsided, a period of [[de-Stalinization]] developed, as Soviets debated what Marxism\u2013Leninism would be in the absence of its de facto enforced equivalence with Stalinism. During the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], the answer that emerged was that it would continue to involve [[economic planning|central planning]] to the nearly complete exclusion of [[market mechanism]]s, as well as the [[totalitarian]] version of collectivism and continuing xenophobia, but that it would no longer involve the extreme degree of state terror seen during the [[Great Purge]] era. This ideological viewpoint maintained the secular [[apotheosis]] of Lenin, treating the terror aspect of Stalinism as a perversion that had been belatedly corrected, rather than admitting that Lenin himself had built a legacy of state terror. This storyline persisted into the Gorbachev era and even mostly survived [[glasnost]], being definitively debunked only after the dissolution of the union and still not rejected even today by many people.

According to Soviet ideology, Russia was in the transition from capitalism to socialism (referred to interchangeably under Lenin as the dictatorship of the proletariat), socialism being the intermediate stage to communism, with the latter being the final stage which follows after socialism.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}} By now, the party leaders believed that universal mass participation and true democracy could only take form in the last stage, if only because of Russia's current conditions at the time.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=159}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=ivory|quote=[Because] the proletariat is still so divided, so degraded, so corrupted in parts [...] that an organization taking in the whole proletariat cannot directly exercise proletarian dictatorship.

The term 'dictatorship' ''has no other meaning but this''.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}}</blockquote>\n\nLenin justified these policies by claiming that all states were class states by nature, and that these states were maintained through [[class struggle]].{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}} This meant that the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union could only be \"won and maintained by the use of violence against the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}} The main problem with this analysis is that the Party came to view anyone opposing or holding alternate views of the party as bourgeoisie.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=162}} The worst enemy remained the moderates, however, which were \"objectively\" considered to be \"the real agents of the bourgeoisie in the working class movement, the labour lieutenants of the capitalist class\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nConsequently, \"bourgeoisie\" became synonymous with \"opponent\" and with people who disagreed with the party in general.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=163}} These oppressive measures led to another reinterpretation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism in general; it was now defined as a purely economic system.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=165}} Slogans and theoretical works about democratic mass participation and collective decision-making were now replaced with texts which supported authoritarian management.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=165}} Considering the situation, the party believed it has to use the same powers as the bourgeoisie to transform Russia, for there was no other alternative.{{sfn|Harding|1996|pp=165\u2013166}} Lenin began arguing that the proletariat, similar to the bourgeoisie, did not have a single preference for a form of government, and because of that dictatorship was acceptable to both the party and the proletariat.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=166}} In a meeting with party officials, Lenin stated\u2014in line with his economist view of socialism\u2014that \"[i]ndustry is indispensable, democracy is not\", further arguing that \"we do not promise any democracy or any freedom\".{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=166}}\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\n{{main|Imperialism}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=Imperialism is capitalism at a stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance-capital is established;

\"the twentieth century marks the turning-point from the old capitalism to the new, from the domination of capital in general to the domination of finance capital.\"{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=353}} Lenin's defines imperialism as the monopoly stage of capitalism.{{sfn|McDonough|1995|p=354}}\n\nDespite radical anti-imperialism being an original core value of Bolshevism, the Soviet Union from 1940 onward was widely viewed as a [[de facto]] imperial power whose ideology could not allow it to admit its own imperialism. Through the Soviet ideological viewpoint, pro-Soviet factions in each country were the only legitimate voice of \"the people\" regardless of whether they were minority factions. All other factions were simply class enemies of \"the people\", inherently illegitimate rulers regardless of whether they were majority factions. Thus, in this view, any country that became Soviet or a Soviet ally naturally did so via a legitimate voluntary desire, even if the requesters needed Soviet help to accomplish it. The principal examples were the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] yielding the annexation of Finnish parts of [[Karelia]], the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the [[occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation of the Baltic states]], and the postwar de facto dominance over the [[satellite state]]s of the [[Eastern Bloc]] under a pretense of total independence. In the [[post-Soviet states|post-Soviet era]] even many Ukrainians, Georgians, and Armenians feel that their countries were forcibly annexed by the Bolsheviks, but this has been a problematic view because the pro-Soviet factions in these societies were once sizable as well. Each faction felt that the other did not represent the [[no true Scotsman|true]] national interest. This [[civil war]]\u2013like paradox has been seen in the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], as pro-Russian Crimeans have been viewed as illegitimate by pro-Ukrainian Crimeans, and vice versa.\n\n===Peaceful coexistence===\n{{main|Peaceful coexistence}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=The loss by imperialism of its dominating role in world affairs and the utmost expansion of the sphere in which the laws of socialist foreign policy operate are  a distinctive feature of the present stage of social development.

policy analyst, referring to series of events (which he believed) would lead to the ultimate victory of socialism.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}}}\n\n\"Peaceful coexistence\" was an ideological concept introduced under Khrushchev's rule.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=71}} While the concept has been interpreted by fellow communists as proposing an end to the conflict between the systems of capitalism and socialism, Khrushchev saw it instead as a continuation of the conflict in every area with the exception in the military field.{{sfn|Evans|1993|pp=71\u201372}} The concept claimed that the two systems were developed \"by way of diametrically opposed laws\", which led to \"opposite principles in foreign policy.\"{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}\n\nThe concept was steeped in Leninist and Stalinist thought.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Lenin believed that international politics were dominated by [[class struggle]], and Stalin stressed in the 1940s the growing [[polarization (politics)|polarization]] which was occurring in the capitalist and socialist systems.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Khrushchev's peaceful coexistence was based on practical changes which had occurred; he accused the old \"two camp\" theory of neglecting the [[non-aligned movement]] and the national [[liberation movement]]s.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Khrushchev considered these \"grey areas\", in which the conflict between capitalism and socialism would be fought.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} He still stressed that the main contradiction in international relations were those of capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}  The Soviet Government under Khrushchev stressed the importance of peaceful coexistence, claiming it had to form the basis of Soviet foreign policy.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Failure to do, they believed, would lead to [[nuclear conflict]].{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Despite this, Soviet theorists still considered peaceful coexistence as a continuation of the class struggle between the capitalist and socialist worlds, just not one based on armed conflict.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Khrushchev believed that the conflict, in its current phase, was mainly economical.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}\n\nThe emphasise on peaceful coexistence did not mean that the Soviet Union accepted a static world, with clear lines.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} They continued to upheld the creed that socialism was inevitable, and they sincerely believed that the world had reached a stage in which the \"correlations of forces\" were moving towards socialism.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}} Also, with the establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and Asia, Soviet foreign policy-planners believed that capitalism had lost its dominance as an economic system.{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=72}}\n\n===Socialism in one country===\n{{main|Socialism in One Country}}\n[[File:Stalin-Bukharin (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|The concept of socialism in one country was developed by Bukharin and Stalin]]\nThe concept of \"socialism in one country\" was conceived by Stalin in his struggle against [[Leon Trotsky]] and his concept of [[permanent revolution]].{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=126}} In 1924, Trotsky published his pamphlet ''[[Lessons of October]]'' in which he stated that socialism in the Soviet Union would fail because of the backward state of economic development unless a [[world revolution]] began.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=126}} Stalin responded to Trotsky's pamphlet with his article, \"[[October and Comrade Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution]]\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} In it, Stalin stated, that he did not believe an inevitable conflict between the [[Proletariat|working class]] and the peasants would take place, further adding that \"socialism in one country is completely possible and probable\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} Stalin held the view common amongst most Bolsheviks at the time; there was possibility of real success for socialism in the Soviet Union despite the country's backwardness and international isolation.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} While [[Grigoriy Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], together with Stalin, opposed Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution, they diverged on how socialism could be built.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} According to Bukharin, Zinoviev and Kamenev supported the resolution of the [[14th Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|14th Conference]] (held in 1925) which stated that \"we cannot complete the building of socialism due to our technological backwardness.\"{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} Despite the rather cynical attitude, Zinoviev and Kamenev did believe that a defective form of socialism could be constructed.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=127}} At the 14th Conference, Stalin reiterated his position, claiming that socialism in one country was feasible despite the capitalist blockade of the country.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=128}} After the conference, Stalin wrote \"[[Concerning the Results of the XIV Conference of the RCP(b)]]\", in which he stated that the peasantry would not turn against the socialist system because he believed they had a self-interest in preserving.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=128}} The contradictions which would arise with the peasantry during the socialist transition, Stalin surmised, could \"be overcome by our own efforts\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=128}} He concluded that the only viable threat to socialism in the Soviet Union was a military intervention.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}}\n\nIn late 1925, Stalin received a letter from a party official which stated that his position of \"Socialism in One Country\" was in contradiction with [[Friedrich Engels]] own writings on the subject.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} Stalin countered, stating that Engels' writings 'reflected' \"the era of pre-monopoly capitalism, the pre-imperialist era when there were not yet the conditions of an uneven, abrupt development of the capitalist countries.\"{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} From 1925 onwards, Bukharin began writing extensively on the subject, and in 1926, Stalin wrote ''[[On Questions of Leninism]]'', which contained his best-known writings on the subject.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} Trotsky, with the publishing of ''[[Leninism (book)|Leninism]]'', began countering Bukharin's and Stalin's arguments, claiming that socialism in one country was possible, but only in the short-run, and claimed that without a [[world revolution]] it would be impossible to safeguard the Soviet Union from the \"restoration of [[bourgeoisie]] relations\".{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=129}} Zinoviev on the other hand, disagreed with both Trotsky and Bukharin and Stalin, holding instead steadfast to Lenin's own position from 1917 to 1922, and continued to claim that only a defecting form of socialism could be constructed in the Soviet Union without a world revolution.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|pp=129\u2013130}} Bukharin, by now, began arguing for the creation of an [[autarkic]] economic model, while Trotsky, in contrast, claimed that the Soviet Union had to participate in the [[international division of labour]] to develop.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=130}} In contrast to Trotsky and Bukharin, Stalin did not believe a world revolution was possible, claiming in 1938 that a world revolution was in fact impossible, and claiming that Engels was wrong on the matter.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} At the [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th Congress]], Stalin took the theory to its inevitable conclusion, claiming that the [[Pure communism|communist mode of production]] could be conceived in one country.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} He rationalised this by claiming that the state could exist in a communist society, as long as the Soviet Union was encircled by capitalism.{{sfn|van Ree|2003|p=133}} However, surprisingly, with the [[Eastern Bloc|establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe]], Stalin claimed that socialism in one country was only possible in a large country like the Soviet Union, and that the other states, in order to survive, had to follow the Soviet line.{{sfn|van

It is flesh-colored, with paler at periphery and below the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]], fading into corneous around the [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]]. The surface is very bright, shining, polished, and smooth except for fine subobsolete concentric lines around the [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]]. The [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] is conoidal. The [[Apex (mollusc)|apex]] is minute but obtuse. The suture is impressed. The shell contains about 5 convex [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s, the last very rapidly widening, somewhat descending toward the [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]]. The rounded aperture is oblique, angular above, nacreous inside. The pearly iridescence is often visible through the shell. The narrow [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]] is profound. Its opening is regularly curved, not separated from the base by a carina.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/manualofconcholo111tryo Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia]</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nThis marine species occurs near the seashore in circum-arctic waters, in the North Atlantic, in European waters; from the [[Bering Strait]] to [[California]], USA; in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].\n\n==Spawning and development==\n[[Spawning]] takes place during the spring in the [[San Juan Islands]], WA, USA.  Prior to spawning two to four snails move close together, one of these is a female and all others are male.  A female release eggs only when in close proximity to a male.  Eggs are released in a mucus strand 2-3 eggs wide.  Eggs are orange to pinkish red, 180-200&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, and each egg is covered by a gelatinous layer 10-30&nbsp;\u00b5m thick.  Sperm release is not visible during spawning but must occur since eggs in newly produced egg masses are fertilized.  The female uses the leading edge of her foot to form the mucus strand into a globular egg mass 0.5-1.5&nbsp;cm in diameter.  Each egg masses contains 90-1000 eggs, and egg masses are anchored to algal surfaces at both ends of the egg mass.<ref name=Strathmann>{{citation |author=Strathmann, M.F. |year=1987 |title=Reproduction and development of marine invertebrates of the northern Pacific coast |publisher=University of Washington Press, 670p}}</ref><ref name=Holyoak>{{citation |author=Holyoak, A.R. |year=1988 |title=Spawning, egg mass formation, and larval development of the trochid gastropod ''Margarites helicinus'' |publisher=The Veliger 31: 111-113}}</ref>\n\nAll embryonic and larval development takes place in the egg mass and young emerge as juvenile snails.<ref name=Strathmann /><ref name=Holyoak /> Development proceeds as eggs undergo [[spiral cleavage]].
