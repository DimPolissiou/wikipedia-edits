Examples of such include:<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n* People who are unable to undergo general anesthesia\n* Prior major open abdominal surgery\n* People who have [[ascites]]\n* Previous radiation therapy to the pelvis\n* A complex hernia\n\n== Surgical approaches ==\nTechniques to repair inguinal hernias fall into two broad categories termed \"open\" and \"[[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]]\". Surgeons tailor their approach by taking into account factors such as their own experience with either techniques, the features of the hernia itself, and the person's anesthetic needs.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":622\"/>\n\nThe cost associated with either approach varies widely across regions.

Prosthetic repairs enable surgeons to repair a hernia without causing undue tension in the surrounding tissues while reinforcing the abdominal wall. Repairs with undue tension have been shown to increase the likelihood that the hernia will recur. Repairs not using prosthetic mesh are preferable options in patients with an above-average risk of infection such as cases where the bowel has become strangulated (blood supply lost due to constriction).<ref name=\":622\"/>\n\nOne large benefit of this approach lies in its ability to tailor anesthesia to a person's needs.

When performed by a surgeon experienced in hernia repair, [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] repair causes fewer complications than Lichtenstein, particularly less [[inguinodynia|chronic pain]]. However, if the surgeon is experienced in general laparoscopic surgery but not in the specific subject of laparoscopic hernia surgery, laparoscopic repair is not advised as it causes more recurrence risk than Lichtenstein while also presenting risks of serious complications, as organ injury. Indeed, the TAPP approach needs to go through the abdomen. All that said, many surgeons are moving to laparoscopic methodologies as they cause smaller incisions, resulting in less bleeding, less infection, faster recovery, reduced hospitalization, and reduced chronic pain.<ref name=\"Mayo\">http://www.mayoclinic.org/minimally-invasive-surgery{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"nice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA83|title=Hernia - laparoscopic surgery (review)|accessdate=2007-03-26|year=2004|work=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+'''Laparoscopic mesh surgery''', as compared to open mesh surgery\n|-\n!

When performed by a surgeon experienced in hernia repair, [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] repair causes fewer complications than Lichtenstein, particularly less [[inguinodynia|chronic pain]]. However, if the surgeon is experienced in general laparoscopic surgery but not in the specific subject of laparoscopic hernia surgery, laparoscopic repair is not advised as it causes more recurrence risk than Lichtenstein while also presenting risks of serious complications, as organ injury. Indeed, the TAPP approach needs to go through the abdomen. All that said, many surgeons are moving to laparoscopic methodologies as they cause smaller incisions, resulting in less bleeding, less infection, faster recovery, reduced hospitalization, and reduced chronic pain.<ref name=\"Mayo\">http://www.mayoclinic.org/minimally-invasive-surgery{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"nice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA83|title=Hernia - laparoscopic surgery (review)|accessdate=2007-03-26|year=2004|work=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+'''Laparoscopic mesh surgery''', as compared to open mesh surgery\n|-\n!

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

Pelagius was also highly educated, spoke and wrote Latin and Greek with great fluency, and was well versed in theology.

He blamed this laxity on the theology of [[divine grace]] preached by Augustine, among others. He began to teach a very strict, rigid moralism, emphasizing a natural, innate human ability to attain salvation.<ref name=Filippo>[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/sfilippo_augustinepelag_jan08.asp Filippo, Stephen N. \"St. Augustine and Pelagianism\". ''Ignatius Insight'']</ref>\n\nWhen [[Alaric I|Alaric]] sacked Rome in 410, Pelagius and his follower [[Caelestius]] fled to [[Carthage]], where he continued his work.<ref name=Fletcher_11 /> He was in Jerusalem by 415.\n\n== Opponents ==\n[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]]]]\n\n=== Augustine of Hippo ===\nPelagianism quickly spread, especially around Carthage. Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''.\" With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>[http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html Jennings, Daniel R., \"Pelagius: Transcript From The Council of Diospolis (Lydda) Against Pelagius, 415AD]</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these, he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.vii.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils: Excursus on Pelagianism], ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', series II, vol 14.</ref>\n\nBelief in Pelagianism and [[Semipelagianism]] was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, the Holy Land, and North Africa. [[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders.

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ... From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts...<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

He blamed this laxity on the theology of [[divine grace]] preached by Augustine, among others. He began to teach a very strict, rigid moralism, emphasizing a natural, innate human ability to attain salvation.<ref name=Filippo>[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/sfilippo_augustinepelag_jan08.asp Filippo, Stephen N. \"St. Augustine and Pelagianism\". ''Ignatius Insight'']</ref>\n\nWhen [[Alaric I|Alaric]] sacked Rome in 410, Pelagius and his follower [[Caelestius]] fled to [[Carthage]], where he continued his work.<ref name=Fletcher_11 /> He was in Jerusalem by 415.\n\n== Opponents ==\n[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]]]]\n\n=== Augustine of Hippo ===\nPelagianism quickly spread, especially around Carthage. Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''.\" With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>[http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html Jennings, Daniel R., \"Pelagius: Transcript From The Council of Diospolis (Lydda) Against Pelagius, 415AD]</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these, he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.vii.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils: Excursus on Pelagianism], ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', series II, vol 14.</ref>\n\nBelief in Pelagianism and [[Semipelagianism]] was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, the Holy Land, and North Africa. [[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers.<ref name=Clark>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111006045016/http://americanphilosophy.net/pelagianheresy.htm Clark, R.

He breaks ties with the [[Roman Empire]], and leads the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] against the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders.\n\nPelagius is the subject of a poem by the [[Glasgow]] poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] (\"Cathures\", Carcanet 2002) which imagines that Pelagius has returned to his native Glasgow (Cathures) and that his Celtic name was Morgan.\n\n[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], in his novel ''[[Emperor (Baxter novel)|Emperor]]'', imagines how time's tapestry would have looked had Pelagius' views and not Augustine's influenced the evolution of Christianity.  He also portrays the Emperor Constantine's actions as having dealt a harsh blow, but not necessarily a mortal one, to Pelagius' teaching that humans are free and sin is not inherent in us.\n\nA facsimile of the 1808 \"A Dissertation of the Pelagian Heresy and the Refutation of it al Llandewi Brevi by St David\" has been printed in [[Carmarthen]] on the same street as the original.\n\n''Heresy: the Life of Pelagius'' (2012) by David Lovejoy, portrays Pelagius through the eyes of his (fictional) servant Arwel.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=794693050&qt=results_page Heresy: the Life of Pelagius by David Lovejoy, Echo Publications]</ref>\n\nIn his [[Sister Fidelma mysteries|Sister Fidelma mystery series]] (1994\u2013present), author Peter Berresford Ellis, under the pen name Peter Tremayne, uses the teachings of Pelagius to contrast the dogma and practices of the contemporary Celtic church and that of Rome for supremacy in the British Isles.\n\n== Writings==\nPelagius wrote: ''De fide Trinitatis libri \u2162'' (\"On Faith in the Trinity: Three Books\"), ''Eclogarum ex divinis Scripturis liber primus'' (\"Excerpts out of Divine Scriptures: Book One\"), and ''Commentarii in epistolas S. Pauli'' (\"Commentary on the Epistles of Saint Paul\").  Unfortunately, most of his work survives only in the quotations of his opponents. Only in the past century have works attributable to Pelagius been identified as such.\n*[http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Letters.html Letters of Pelagius: To a Presbyter, Augustine of Hippo, and Pope Innocent I]\n*[http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_On_Nature.html On Nature]\n*[http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Defense_Of_The_Freedom_Of_The_Will.html Defense of the Freedom of the Will]\n* ''Pelagius's Commentary on St Paul's Epistle to the Romans''<ref>''Pelagius's Commentary on St Paul's Epistle to the Romans'' (translated with introduction and notes by Theodore de Bruyn), Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-19-814399-0}}</ref>\n*''Pelagius's Expositions of the Thirteen Epistles of St. Paul''<ref>\"Pelagius's Expositions of the Thirteen Epistles of St. Paul\"  ''(edited by A.
