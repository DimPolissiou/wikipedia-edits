This protocol is also called [[NetBIOS Frames protocol|NetBIOS Frames]] (NBF). NBF is supported on Windows 2000, Windows NT, and Windows Me/98/95. NetBEUI is no longer supported on Windows XP and later. However, SMB Protocol can also be used without a separate transport protocol directly over TCP, port 445. NetBIOS was also supported over several legacy protocols such as [[IPX/SPX]].\n\nThe SMB Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system provides [[named pipe]]s and was one of the first inter-process mechanisms commonly available to programmers that provides a means for services to inherit the authentication carried out when a client{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}<!-- What type of client-Windows?--> first connects to an SMB server.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nSome services that operate over named pipes, such as those which use Microsoft's own implementation of [[DCE/RPC]] over SMB, known as [[MSRPC]] over SMB, also allow MSRPC client programs to perform authentication, which overrides the authorization provided by the SMB server, but only in the context of the MSRPC client program that successfully makes the additional authentication.\n\n''SMB signing'': Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and upwards have the capability to use cryptography to [[Digital signature|digitally sign]] SMB connections.

SMB1/CIFS is an extremely chatty protocol, in that it makes inefficient use of networking resources, particularly when transported over expensive WAN links.  While Microsoft estimates that SMB1/CIFS comprises less than 10% of network traffic in the average Enterprise network, that is still a significant amount of traffic. One approach to mitigating the inefficiencies in the protocol is to use WAN Acceleration products such as those provided by Riverbed, Silver Peak, or Cisco Systems. A better approach is simply to eliminate SMB1/CIFS by upgrading the server infrastructure that uses it.  This includes both NAS devices as well as Windows Server 2003.  The most effective method in use currently to identify SMB1/CIFS traffic is to use a network analyzer tool such as Wireshark, etc., to identify SMB1/CIFS \"talkers\" and then decommission or upgrade them over time.  Microsoft also provides an auditing tool in Windows Server 2016, which can be used to track down SMB1/CIFS talkers.<ref name=\"messageanalyzer\">{{cite web |last1=Kyttle |first1=Ralph |title=SMB1 \u2013 Audit Active Usage using Message Analyzer |url=https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ralphkyttle/2017/05/13/smb1-audit-active-usage-using-message-analyzer/ |website=Microsoft TechNet |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=28 March 2019 |date=13 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, when Sun Microsystems announced [[WebNFS]],<ref name=WebNFS>{{cite web |title=WebNFS - Technical Overview |url=http://www.sun.com/software/webnfs/overview.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518204025/http://www.sun.com/software/webnfs/overview.xml |archivedate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Microsoft launched an initiative to rename SMB to Common Internet File System (CIFS)<ref name='tridgemyths' /> and added more features, including support for [[symbolic link]]s, [[hard link]]s, larger file sizes, and an initial attempt at supporting direct connections over TCP port 445 without requiring [[NetBIOS]] as a transport (a largely experimental effort that required further refinement).

It adds the ability to compound multiple actions into a single request, which significantly reduces the number of [[round-trip delay time|round-trips]] the client needs to make to the server, improving performance as a result.<ref name=\"barreto\"/> SMB1 also has a compounding mechanism\u2014known as AndX\u2014to compound multiple actions, but Microsoft clients rarely use AndX.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It also introduces the notion of \"durable file handles\": these allow a connection to an SMB server to survive brief network outages, as are typical in a wireless network, without having to incur the overhead of re-negotiating a new session.\n\nSMB2 includes support for [[symbolic link]]s. Other improvements include caching of file properties, improved message signing with [[HMAC]] [[SHA-256]] hashing algorithm and better scalability by increasing the number of users, shares and open files per server among others.<ref name=\"barreto\"/> The SMB1 protocol uses 16-bit data sizes, which amongst other things, limits the maximum block size to 64K. SMB2 uses 32 or 64-bit wide storage fields, and 128 bits in the case of [[file handle|file-handle]]s, thereby removing previous constraints on block sizes, which improves performance with large file transfers over fast networks.<ref name=\"barreto\"/>\n\nWindows Vista/[[Server 2008]] and later operating systems use SMB2 when communicating with other machines also capable of using SMB2. SMB1 continues in use for connections with older versions of Windows, as well various vendors' [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] solutions. Samba 3.5 also includes experimental support for SMB2.<ref>[http://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.5.0.html Samba 3.5.0 Available for Download]</ref> Samba 3.6 fully supports SMB2, except the modification of user quotas using the Windows quota management tools.<ref>[http://samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.6.0.html Samba 3.6.0 Available for Download]</ref>\n\nWhen SMB2 was introduced it brought a number of benefits over SMB1 for third party implementers of SMB protocols. SMB1, originally designed by [[IBM]], was [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]], and later became part of a wide variety of non-Windows operating systems such as [[Xenix]], [[OS/2]] and [[OpenVMS|VMS]] ([[Pathworks]]). [[X/Open]] standardized it partially; it also had draft [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] standards which lapsed. (See http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Intro.html for historical detail.) SMB2 is also a relatively clean break with the past. Microsoft's SMB1 code has to work with a large variety of SMB clients and servers. SMB1 features many versions of information for commands (selecting what structure to return for a particular request) because features such as [[Unicode]] support were retro-fitted at a later date. SMB2 involves significantly reduced compatibility-testing for implementers of the protocol. SMB2 code has considerably less complexity since far less variability exists (for example, non-Unicode code paths become redundant as SMB2 requires Unicode support).\n\nApple is also migrating to SMB2 (from their own [[Apple Filing Protocol]], now legacy) with OS X 10.9.<ref name=\"ai2013\">{{cite web|last=Eran |first=Daniel |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/11/apple-shifts-from-afp-file-sharing-to-smb2-in-os-x-109-mavericks |title=Apple shifts from AFP file sharing to SMB2 in OS X 10.9 Mavericks |publisher=Appleinsider.com |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref> This transition was fraught with compatibility problems though.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vaughan |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.zdnet.com/mavericks-smb2-problem-and-fixes-7000022519/ |title=Mavericks' SMB2 problem and fixes |publisher=ZDNet |date=October 28, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=MacParc |url=http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20131122083837447 |title=10.9: Switch the SMB stack to use SMB1 as default |work=Mac OS X Hints |publisher=macworld.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref> Non-default support for SMB2 appeared in fact in OS X 10.7, when Apple abandoned Samba in favor of its own SMB implementation called SMBX.<ref name=\"ai2013\"/> Apple switched to its own SMBX implementation after Samba adopted [[GPLv3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20046383-263.html|title=Say adios to Samba in OS X|author=Topher Kessler|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/24572/Apple_Ditches_SAMBA_in_Favour_of_Homegrown_Replacement|title=Apple Ditches SAMBA in Favour of Homegrown Replacement|author=Thom Holwerda|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Linux kernel]]'s CIFS client file system has SMB2 support since version 3.7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.7#head-7c9c911e4c41bcbc635cd8fa561278c833844bc2|title=Linux 3.7 -

SMB 3.1.1 also makes secure negotiation mandatory when connecting to clients using SMB 2.x and higher.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n==== General issues ====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2019}}\nSMB works through a [[client-server]] approach, where a [[client (computing)|client]] makes specific requests and the server responds accordingly. One section of the SMB protocol specifically deals with access to [[filesystem]]s, such that clients may make requests to a [[file server]]; but some other sections of the SMB protocol specialize in [[inter-process communication]] (IPC). The Inter-Process Communication (IPC) share, or ipc$, is a network share on computers running Microsoft Windows. This virtual share is used to facilitate communication between processes and computers over SMB, often to exchange data between computers that have been authenticated.\n\nDevelopers have optimized the SMB protocol for local [[Subnetwork|subnet]] usage, but users have also put SMB to work to access different subnets across the Internet\u2014[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s involving file-sharing or print-sharing in MS Windows environments usually focus on such usage.\n\nSMB servers make their file systems and other [[resource (computer science)|resource]]s available to clients on the network. Client computers may want access to the shared file systems and printers on the server, and in this primary functionality SMB has become best-known and most heavily used. However, the SMB file-server aspect would count for little without the [[NT domain]]s suite of protocols, which provide NT-style domain-based [[authentication]] at the very least. Almost all implementations of SMB servers use NT Domain authentication to validate user-access to resources.\n\n===== Performance issues =====\nThe use of the SMB protocol has often correlated with a significant increase in [[broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] traffic on a network. However the SMB itself does not use broadcasts\u2014the broadcast problems commonly associated with SMB actually originate with the [[NetBIOS]] service location protocol.{{clarify|reason=Does this refer to service location via name resolution or via the browser protocol?|date=March 2013}} By default, a [[Microsoft Windows NT 4.0]] server used NetBIOS to advertise and locate services. NetBIOS functions by broadcasting services available on a particular host at regular intervals. While this usually makes for an acceptable default in a network with a smaller number of hosts, increased broadcast traffic can cause problems as the number of hosts on the network increases. The implementation of name resolution infrastructure in the form of [[Windows Internet Naming Service]] (WINS) or [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) resolves this problem. WINS was a proprietary implementation used with Windows NT 4.0 networks, but brought about its own issues and complexities in the design and maintenance of a Microsoft network.\n\nSince the release of Windows 2000, the use of WINS for name resolution has been deprecated by Microsoft, with hierarchical [[Dynamic DNS]] now configured as the default name resolution protocol for all Windows operating systems. Resolution of (short) NetBIOS names by DNS requires that a DNS client expand short names, usually by appending a connection-specific DNS suffix to its DNS lookup queries. WINS can still be configured on clients as a secondary name resolution protocol for interoperability with legacy Windows environments and applications. Further, Microsoft DNS servers can forward name resolution requests to legacy WINS servers in order to support name resolution integration with legacy (pre-Windows 2000) environments that do not support DNS.\n\n[[Network planning and design|Network designer]]s have found that [[Lag|latency]] has a significant impact on the performance of the SMB 1.0 protocol, that it performs more poorly than other protocols like [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]].

It has the following advantages over user-space implementations: It provides better performance, and it's easier to implement some features like SMB Direct. It supports SMB 3.1.1 and previous versions.\n\n== Opportunistic locking ==\n\nIn the SMB protocol, ''opportunistic locking'' is a mechanism designed to improve performance by controlling [[cache (computing)|caching]] of network files by the client.<ref>{{cite web|title= Opportunistic Locks|url= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365433(v=vs.85).aspx|publisher= Microsoft|accessdate= November 6, 2012}}</ref> Unlike traditional [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]s, ''OpLocks'' are not strictly [[file locking]] or used to provide mutual exclusion.\n\nThere are four types of opportunistic locks:\n\n; Batch Locks: Batch OpLocks were created originally to support a particular behavior of DOS batch file execution operation in which the file is opened and closed many times in a short period, which is a performance problem. To solve this, a client may ask for an OpLock of type \"batch\". In this case, the client delays sending the close request and if a subsequent open request is given, the two requests cancel each other.<ref name=Sphere2014>{{Citation | title = All About Opportunistic Locking | url = http://www.sphereitconsulting.co.uk/blog/servers-and-networks/all-about-opportunistic-locks/ | year = 2014 | author = Sphere, I.T. | accessdate = April 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n; Level&nbsp;1 OpLocks / Exclusive Locks: When an application opens in \"shared mode\" a file hosted on an SMB server which is not opened by any other process (or other clients) the client receives an '''exclusive OpLock''' from the server. This means that the client may now assume that it is the only process with access to this particular file, and the client may now cache all changes to the file before committing it to the server. This is a performance improvement, since fewer round-trips are required in order to read and write to the file. If another client/process tries to open the same file, the server sends a message to the client (called a ''break'' or ''revocation'') which invalidates the exclusive lock previously given to the client. The client then flushes all changes to the file.\n; Level&nbsp;2 OpLocks: If an exclusive OpLock is held by a client and a locked file is opened by a third party, the client has to relinquish its exclusive OpLock to allow the other client's write/read access. A client may then receive a \"Level&nbsp;2 OpLock\" from the server. A Level&nbsp;2 OpLock allows the caching of read requests but excludes write caching.\n; Filter OpLocks: Added in NT&nbsp;4.0, Filter Oplocks are similar to Level&nbsp;2 OpLocks but prevent sharing-mode violations between file open and lock reception. Microsoft advises use of Filter OpLocks only where it is important to allow multiple readers and Level&nbsp;2 OpLocks in other circumstances.\n\nClients holding an OpLock do not really hold a lock on the file, instead they are notified via a ''break'' when another client wants to access the file in a way inconsistent with their lock. The other client's request is held up while the break is being processed.\n\n; Breaks: In contrast with the SMB protocol's \"standard\" behavior, a break request may be sent ''from'' server ''to'' client. It informs the client that an OpLock is no longer valid. This happens, for example, when another client wishes to open a file in a way that invalidates the OpLock. The first client is then sent an OpLock break and required to send all its local changes (in case of batch or exclusive OpLocks), if any, and acknowledge the OpLock break. Upon this acknowledgment the server can reply to the second client in a consistent manner.\n\n== Security ==\nOver the years, there have been many security vulnerabilities in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol or components on which it directly relies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329170|title=MS02-070: Flaw in SMB Signing May Permit Group Policy to Be Modified|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=November 1, 2009|date=December 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958687|title=MS09-001: Vulnerabilities in SMB could allow remote code execution|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=November 1, 2009|date=January 13, 2009}},</ref> Other vendors' security vulnerabilities lie primarily in a lack of support for newer [[authentication protocol]]s like [[NTLMv2]] and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] in favor of protocols like NTLMv1, [[LM hash|LanMan]], or plaintext passwords.

This protocol is also called [[NetBIOS Frames protocol|NetBIOS Frames]] (NBF). NBF is supported on Windows 2000, Windows NT, and Windows Me/98/95. NetBEUI is no longer supported on Windows XP and later. However, SMB Protocol can also be used without a separate transport protocol directly over TCP, port 445. NetBIOS was also supported over several legacy protocols such as [[IPX/SPX]].\n\nThe SMB Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system provides [[named pipe]]s and was one of the first inter-process mechanisms commonly available to programmers that provides a means for services to inherit the authentication carried out when a client{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}<!-- What type of client-Windows?--> first connects to an SMB server.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nSome services that operate over named pipes, such as those which use Microsoft's own implementation of [[DCE/RPC]] over SMB, known as [[MSRPC]] over SMB, also allow MSRPC client programs to perform authentication, which overrides the authorization provided by the SMB server, but only in the context of the MSRPC client program that successfully makes the additional authentication.\n\n''SMB signing'': Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and upwards have the capability to use cryptography to [[Digital signature|digitally sign]] SMB connections.

SMB1/CIFS is an extremely chatty protocol, in that it makes inefficient use of networking resources, particularly when transported over expensive WAN links.  While Microsoft estimates that SMB1/CIFS comprises less than 10% of network traffic in the average Enterprise network, that is still a significant amount of traffic. One approach to mitigating the inefficiencies in the protocol is to use WAN Acceleration products such as those provided by Riverbed, Silver Peak, or Cisco Systems. A better approach is simply to eliminate SMB1/CIFS by upgrading the server infrastructure that uses it.  This includes both NAS devices as well as Windows Server 2003.  The most effective method in use currently to identify SMB1/CIFS traffic is to use a network analyzer tool such as Wireshark, etc., to identify SMB1/CIFS \"talkers\" and then decommission or upgrade them over time.  Microsoft also provides an auditing tool in Windows Server 2016, which can be used to track down SMB1/CIFS talkers.<ref name=\"messageanalyzer\">{{cite web |last1=Kyttle |first1=Ralph |title=SMB1 \u2013 Audit Active Usage using Message Analyzer |url=https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ralphkyttle/2017/05/13/smb1-audit-active-usage-using-message-analyzer/ |website=Microsoft TechNet |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=28 March 2019 |date=13 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, when Sun Microsystems announced [[WebNFS]],<ref name=WebNFS>{{cite web |title=WebNFS - Technical Overview |url=http://www.sun.com/software/webnfs/overview.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518204025/http://www.sun.com/software/webnfs/overview.xml |archivedate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Microsoft launched an initiative to rename SMB to Common Internet File System (CIFS)<ref name='tridgemyths' /> and added more features, including support for [[symbolic link]]s, [[hard link]]s, larger file sizes, and an initial attempt at supporting direct connections over TCP port 445 without requiring [[NetBIOS]] as a transport (a largely experimental effort that required further refinement).

Other improvements include caching of file properties, improved message signing with [[HMAC]] [[SHA-256]] hashing algorithm and better scalability by increasing the number of users, shares and open files per server among others.<ref name=\"barreto\"/> The SMB1 protocol uses 16-bit data sizes, which amongst other things, limits the maximum block size to 64K. SMB2 uses 32 or 64-bit wide storage fields, and 128 bits in the case of [[file handle|file-handle]]s, thereby removing previous constraints on block sizes, which improves performance with large file transfers over fast networks.<ref name=\"barreto\"/>\n\nWindows Vista/[[Server 2008]] and later operating systems use SMB2 when communicating with other machines also capable of using SMB2. SMB1 continues in use for connections with older versions of Windows, as well various vendors' [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] solutions. Samba 3.5 also includes experimental support for SMB2.<ref>[http://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.5.0.html Samba 3.5.0 Available for Download]</ref> Samba 3.6 fully supports SMB2, except the modification of user quotas using the Windows quota management tools.<ref>[http://samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.6.0.html Samba 3.6.0 Available for Download]</ref>\n\nWhen SMB2 was introduced it brought a number of benefits over SMB1 for third party implementers of SMB protocols. SMB1, originally designed by [[IBM]], was [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]], and later became part of a wide variety of non-Windows operating systems such as [[Xenix]], [[OS/2]] and [[OpenVMS|VMS]] ([[Pathworks]]). [[X/Open]] standardized it partially; it also had draft [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] standards which lapsed. (See http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Intro.html for historical detail.) SMB2 is also a relatively clean break with the past. Microsoft's SMB1 code has to work with a large variety of SMB clients and servers. SMB1 features many versions of information for commands (selecting what structure to return for a particular request) because features such as [[Unicode]] support were retro-fitted at a later date. SMB2 involves significantly reduced compatibility-testing for implementers of the protocol. SMB2 code has considerably less complexity since far less variability exists (for example, non-Unicode code paths become redundant as SMB2 requires Unicode support).\n\nApple is also migrating to SMB2 (from their own [[Apple Filing Protocol]], now legacy) with OS X 10.9.<ref name=\"ai2013\">{{cite web|last=Eran |first=Daniel |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/11/apple-shifts-from-afp-file-sharing-to-smb2-in-os-x-109-mavericks |title=Apple shifts from AFP file sharing to SMB2 in OS X 10.9 Mavericks |publisher=Appleinsider.com |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref> This transition was fraught with compatibility problems though.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vaughan |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.zdnet.com/mavericks-smb2-problem-and-fixes-7000022519/ |title=Mavericks' SMB2 problem and fixes |publisher=ZDNet |date=October 28, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=MacParc |url=http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20131122083837447 |title=10.9: Switch the SMB stack to use SMB1 as default |work=Mac OS X Hints |publisher=macworld.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref> Non-default support for SMB2 appeared in fact in OS X 10.7, when Apple abandoned Samba in favor of its own SMB implementation called SMBX.<ref name=\"ai2013\"/> Apple switched to its own SMBX implementation after Samba adopted [[GPLv3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20046383-263.html|title=Say adios to Samba in OS X|author=Topher Kessler|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/24572/Apple_Ditches_SAMBA_in_Favour_of_Homegrown_Replacement|title=Apple Ditches SAMBA in Favour of Homegrown Replacement|author=Thom Holwerda|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Linux kernel]]'s CIFS client file system has SMB2 support since version 3.7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.7#head-7c9c911e4c41bcbc635cd8fa561278c833844bc2|title=Linux 3.7 -

SMB 3.1.1 also makes secure negotiation mandatory when connecting to clients using SMB 2.x and higher.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n==== General issues ====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2019}}\nSMB works through a [[client-server]] approach, where a [[client (computing)|client]] makes specific requests and the server responds accordingly. One section of the SMB protocol specifically deals with access to [[filesystem]]s, such that clients may make requests to a [[file server]]; but some other sections of the SMB protocol specialize in [[inter-process communication]] (IPC). The Inter-Process Communication (IPC) share, or ipc$, is a network share on computers running Microsoft Windows. This virtual share is used to facilitate communication between processes and computers over SMB, often to exchange data between computers that have been authenticated.\n\nDevelopers have optimized the SMB protocol for local [[Subnetwork|subnet]] usage, but users have also put SMB to work to access different subnets across the Internet\u2014[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s involving file-sharing or print-sharing in MS Windows environments usually focus on such usage.\n\nSMB servers make their file systems and other [[resource (computer science)|resource]]s available to clients on the network. Client computers may want access to the shared file systems and printers on the server, and in this primary functionality SMB has become best-known and most heavily used. However, the SMB file-server aspect would count for little without the [[NT domain]]s suite of protocols, which provide NT-style domain-based [[authentication]] at the very least. Almost all implementations of SMB servers use NT Domain authentication to validate user-access to resources.\n\n===== Performance issues =====\nThe use of the SMB protocol has often correlated with a significant increase in [[broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] traffic on a network. However the SMB itself does not use broadcasts\u2014the broadcast problems commonly associated with SMB actually originate with the [[NetBIOS]] service location protocol.{{clarify|reason=Does this refer to service location via name resolution or via the browser protocol?|date=March 2013}} By default, a [[Microsoft Windows NT 4.0]] server used NetBIOS to advertise and locate services. NetBIOS functions by broadcasting services available on a particular host at regular intervals. While this usually makes for an acceptable default in a network with a smaller number of hosts, increased broadcast traffic can cause problems as the number of hosts on the network increases. The implementation of name resolution infrastructure in the form of [[Windows Internet Naming Service]] (WINS) or [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) resolves this problem. WINS was a proprietary implementation used with Windows NT 4.0 networks, but brought about its own issues and complexities in the design and maintenance of a Microsoft network.\n\nSince the release of Windows 2000, the use of WINS for name resolution has been deprecated by Microsoft, with hierarchical [[Dynamic DNS]] now configured as the default name resolution protocol for all Windows operating systems. Resolution of (short) NetBIOS names by DNS requires that a DNS client expand short names, usually by appending a connection-specific DNS suffix to its DNS lookup queries. WINS can still be configured on clients as a secondary name resolution protocol for interoperability with legacy Windows environments and applications. Further, Microsoft DNS servers can forward name resolution requests to legacy WINS servers in order to support name resolution integration with legacy (pre-Windows 2000) environments that do not support DNS.\n\n[[Network planning and design|Network designer]]s have found that [[Lag|latency]] has a significant impact on the performance of the SMB 1.0 protocol, that it performs more poorly than other protocols like [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]. Monitoring reveals a high degree of \"chattiness\" and a disregard of network latency between hosts.<ref name=\"barreto\">{{ cite web | url = http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2008/12/05/smb2-a-complete-redesign-of-the-main-remote-file-protocol-for-windows.aspx | author = Jose Barreto | publisher = [[Microsoft TechNet]] Server & Management Blogs | title = SMB2, a Complete Redesign of the Main Remote File Protocol for Windows | date=December 9, 2008 | accessdate=November 1, 2009 }}</ref> For example, a [[Virtual private network|VPN]] connection over the [[Internet]] will often introduce network latency. Microsoft has explained that performance issues come about primarily because SMB 1.0 is a block-level rather than a [[Streaming algorithm|streaming]] protocol, that was originally designed for small [[local area network|LANs]]; it has a block size that is limited to 64K, SMB signing creates an additional overhead and the [[TCP tuning|TCP window size]] is not optimized for WAN links.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/neilcar/smbcifs-performance-over-wan-links|title=SMB/CIFS Performance Over WAN Links|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=October 26, 2004|accessdate=February 13, 2020|author=Neil Carpenter}}</ref> Solutions to this problem include the updated SMB 2.0 protocol,<ref>{{cite web|title=What's New in SMB in Windows Server|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831474(v=ws.11).aspx|website=Microsoft|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> [[Offline Files]], [[TCP window scale option|TCP window scaling]] and [[WAN optimization|WAN acceleration]] devices from various network vendors that cache and optimize SMB 1.0<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files2/sdc_archives/2009_presentations/monday/MarkRabinovich-IgorGokhman-CIFS_Acceleration_Techniques.pdf|title=CIFS Acceleration Techniques|publisher=Storage Developer Conference, SNIA, Santa Clara 2009|author=Mark Rabinovich, Igor Gokhman}}</ref> and 2.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snia.org/sites/default/files2/SDC2011/presentations/wednesday/MarkRabinovichAccelerating_SMB2.pdf|title=Accelerating SMB2|publisher=Storage Developer Conference, SNIA, Santa Clara 2011|author=Mark Rabinovich}}</ref>\n\n===== Microsoft's modifications =====\nMicrosoft added several extensions to its own SMB implementation.

NQ is portable to non-Windows platforms such as [[Linux]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], as well as to [[VxWorks]], [[Integrity (operating system)|Integrity]], and other [[real-time operating system]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://visualitynq.com/products/ynq|title=YNQ\u2122 SMB Library For Embedded Devices|website=visualitynq.com|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== MoSMB ===\nMoSMB is a proprietary SMB implementation for Linux and other [[Unix-like]] systems, developed by Ryussi Technologies.

The platform could be used for traditional NAS, Cloud Gateway, and Cloud Caching devices for providing secure access to files across a network.  Likewise was purchased by [[EMC Isilon]] in 2012.\n\n=== CIFSD ===\n[[CIFSD]] is an open source In-kernel CIFS/SMB server implementation for Linux kernel. It has the following advantages over user-space implementations: It provides better performance, and it's easier to implement some features like SMB Direct. It supports SMB 3.1.1 and previous versions.\n\n== Opportunistic locking ==\n\nIn the SMB protocol, ''opportunistic locking'' is a mechanism designed to improve performance by controlling [[cache (computing)|caching]] of network files by the client.<ref>{{cite web|title= Opportunistic Locks|url= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365433(v=vs.85).aspx|publisher= Microsoft|accessdate= November 6, 2012}}</ref> Unlike traditional [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]s, ''OpLocks'' are not strictly [[file locking]] or used to provide mutual exclusion.\n\nThere are four types of opportunistic locks:\n\n; Batch Locks: Batch OpLocks were created originally to support a particular behavior of DOS batch file execution operation in which the file is opened and closed many times in a short period, which is a performance problem. To solve this, a client may ask for an OpLock of type \"batch\". In this case, the client delays sending the close request and if a subsequent open request is given, the two requests cancel each other.<ref name=Sphere2014>{{Citation | title = All About Opportunistic Locking | url = http://www.sphereitconsulting.co.uk/blog/servers-and-networks/all-about-opportunistic-locks/ | year = 2014 | author = Sphere, I.T. | accessdate = April 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n; Level&nbsp;1 OpLocks / Exclusive Locks: When an application opens in \"shared mode\" a file hosted on an SMB server which is not opened by any other process (or other clients) the client receives an '''exclusive OpLock''' from the server. This means that the client may now assume that it is the only process with access to this particular file, and the client may now cache all changes to the file before committing it to the server. This is a performance improvement, since fewer round-trips are required in order to read and write to the file. If another client/process tries to open the same file, the server sends a message to the client (called a ''break'' or ''revocation'') which invalidates the exclusive lock previously given to the client. The client then flushes all changes to the file.\n; Level&nbsp;2 OpLocks: If an exclusive OpLock is held by a client and a locked file is opened by a third party, the client has to relinquish its exclusive OpLock to allow the other client's write/read access. A client may then receive a \"Level&nbsp;2 OpLock\" from the server. A Level&nbsp;2 OpLock allows the caching of read requests but excludes write caching.\n; Filter OpLocks: Added in NT&nbsp;4.0, Filter Oplocks are similar to Level&nbsp;2 OpLocks but prevent sharing-mode violations between file open and lock reception. Microsoft advises use of Filter OpLocks only where it is important to allow multiple readers and Level&nbsp;2 OpLocks in other circumstances.\n\nClients holding an OpLock do not really hold a lock on the file, instead they are notified via a ''break'' when another client wants to access the file in a way inconsistent with their lock. The other client's request is held up while the break is being processed.\n\n; Breaks: In contrast with the SMB protocol's \"standard\" behavior, a break request may be sent ''from'' server ''to'' client. It informs the client that an OpLock is no longer valid. This happens, for example, when another client wishes to open a file in a way that invalidates the OpLock. The first client is then sent an OpLock break and required to send all its local changes (in case of batch or exclusive OpLocks), if any, and acknowledge the OpLock break. Upon this acknowledgment the server can reply to the second client in a consistent manner.\n\n== Security ==\nOver the years, there have been many security vulnerabilities in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol or components on which it directly relies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329170|title=MS02-070: Flaw in SMB Signing May Permit Group Policy to Be Modified|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=November 1, 2009|date=December 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958687|title=MS09-001: Vulnerabilities in SMB could allow remote code execution|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=November 1, 2009|date=January 13, 2009}},</ref> Other vendors' security vulnerabilities lie primarily in a lack of support for newer [[authentication protocol]]s like [[NTLMv2]] and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] in favor of protocols like NTLMv1, [[LM hash|LanMan]], or plaintext passwords.

It is the principal city of the Burlington, North Carolina [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which encompasses all of Alamance County, in which most of the city is located, and is a part of the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point CSA]]. The population was 50,042 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3709060| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Burlington city, North Carolina, revision 08-09-2012| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref> which makes Burlington the 17th largest city in North Carolina. The Metropolitan Statistical Area population was over 150,000 in 2010.\n\n==History==\nAlamance County was created when [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]] was partitioned in 1849. Early settlers included several groups of [[Quakers]], many of which remain active in the [[Snow Camp, North Carolina|Snow Camp]] area, German farmers, and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants.\n\nThe need of the [[North Carolina Railroad]] in the 1850s to locate land where they could build, repair and do maintenance on its track was the genesis of Burlington, North Carolina. The company selected a piece of land slightly west of present-day [[Graham, North Carolina|Graham]]. On January 29, 1856, the last spikes were driven into the final tie of the North Carolina Railroad project, uniting the cities of [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]] and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] by rail. The next day, the first locomotive passed along the new route. When the iron horse arrived in Alamance County, locals referred to it as \"the eighth wonder of the world\".\n[[File:Company Shops Train Depot.jpg|500px|thumb|left|Company Shops train depot]]\n\nNot long after this historic opening, the railroad realized a pressing need for repair shops. With Alamance County's position along the new line, it became the logical choice for the shops' location. After several debates concerning where the shops would be located, Gen. Benjamin Trollinger, a progressive Alamance County manufacturer, made an offer that settled the matter. Gen. Trollinger owned land just northwest of Graham, and he convinced several other prominent citizens owning adjacent lots to join him and sell their property to the railroad. 57 buildings were constructed between 1855 and 1859, including structures for engine and machine shops, carpentry, blacksmithing, houses for workers and railway officials, and company headquarters. For a brief period, railroad directors changed the name of Company Shops to Vance (1863-1864), but the town returned to the \"Company Shops\" moniker in July 1864, and officially incorporating as Company Shops in 1866.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/company-shops|title=\"Company Shops\"|last=Troxler|first=George|date=July 9, 2017|website=NCPedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Thirty-nine white men and two free African-Americans were employed in or around the shops, with twenty slaves constrained to assist. Sale of town lots soon started, but not surprisingly, the sale of lots was slow until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. By 1864, Company Shops numbered about 300 persons.\n\nThrough a series of leases and mergers, the railroad was leased to [[Richmond and Danville Railroad|Richmond & Danville Railroad]] (1871), working as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in 1893, the North Carolina Railroad was folded into the Southern Railway system. Following the leasing of the railroad to Richmond & Danville, many of the railroad jobs transferred to Richmond and Manchester. With the railroad shops no longer operated there, the citizens of Company Shops decided a new name was needed. In February 1887, an appointed committee for the town selected the name Burlington, and the name was officially changed through North Carolina State Legislature.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAround the turn of the century, E.M. Holt established small textile operations along the [[Haw River]] and Great Alamance Creek. In 1908, E.M. Holt built the first [[cotton mill]] in the South. From the establishment of this single factory, Alamance County grew to eventually operate 30 cotton mills and 10 to 15 yarn manufacturing plants employing 15,000 people. Eventually, the early textile venture of E.M. Holt became known all over the world as [[Burlington Industries]], and is now headquartered in nearby [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. Throughout this period, Burlington became a prosperous and vibrant little city filled with schools, churches, newspapers, telegraph and telephone lines, roads and a streetcar line{{emdash}}all in keeping with the latest \"modern progress\" of the times.\n\nThough textiles continued to dominate the local economy well into the 1970s, the people of Burlington knew they could not survive with only one industry. The country's involvement in World War II brought important local economic changes. In 1942, the federal government purchased and leased a {{convert|22|acre|adj=on}} site to [[Fairchild Aircraft]] Corporation for the construction of test aircraft. After two years of production, the site was leased to [[Firestone Tire Company]] for the Army's tank rebuilding program. At the close of the war, the federal government chose not to leave, but to utilize the property for government contract business. This decision would bring [[Western Electric]] to town along with new employees from around the country. Their contracts ensured Burlington's participation during the [[Cold War]] manufacturing and testing of emerging defense technologies. Four decades later (1991), however, the doors to Western Electric (then [[Lucent Technologies]]) were locked, and another chapter of Burlington's history was over.\n[[File:Historic train depot in downtown Burlington.jpg|thumb|412x412px|Historic train depot in downtown Burlington]]\nDuring this century-and-a-half of economic change, Burlington grew, adapted and prospered. Originally the center of commerce for Company Shops, the downtown area still serves as the heart of today's community with financial services, government services, an expanded library, small shops, eateries and a restored theater. Downtown has also returned to its status as a major employment center, becoming the home to [[LabCorp|Laboratory Corporation of America]], one of the world's largest biomedical testing firms and Burlington/Alamance County's largest employer.\n\nThe [[Alamance Hotel]], [[Allen House (Burlington, North Carolina)|Allen House]], [[Atlantic Bank and Trust Company Building]], [[Beverly Hills Historic District]], [[Downtown Burlington Historic District]], [[East Davis Street Historic District]], [[Efird Building]], [[First Baptist Church (Burlington, North Carolina)|First Baptist Church]], [[First Christian Church of Burlington]], [[Polly Fogleman House]], [[Holt-Frost House]], [[Horner Houses]], [[Lakeside Mills Historic District]], [[McCray School]], [[Menagerie Carousel]], [[Moore-Holt-White House]], [[South Broad-East Fifth Streets Historic District]], [[Southern Railway Passenger Station (Burlington, North Carolina)|Southern Railway Passenger Station]], [[St. Athanasius Episcopal Church and Parish House and the Church of the Holy Comforter]], [[Stagg House]], [[Sunny Side (Burlington, North Carolina)|Sunny Side]], [[United States Post Office (Burlington, North Carolina)|US Post Office]], [[West Davis Street-Fountain Place Historic District]], and [[Windsor Cotton Mills Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBurlington is located at {{Coord|36|5|23|N|79|26|44|W|type:city}} (36.089636, -79.445578).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nLocated in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, Burlington is characterized as having mostly flat land with a few rolling hills.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|65.7|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|65.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.5|km2|order=flip}}, or 0.82%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

It is the principal city of the Burlington, North Carolina [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which encompasses all of Alamance County, in which most of the city is located, and is a part of the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point CSA]]. The population was 50,042 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3709060| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Burlington city, North Carolina, revision 08-09-2012| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref> which makes Burlington the 17th largest city in North Carolina. The Metropolitan Statistical Area population was over 150,000 in 2010.\n\n==History==\nAlamance County was created when [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]] was partitioned in 1849. Early settlers included several groups of [[Quakers]], many of which remain active in the [[Snow Camp, North Carolina|Snow Camp]] area, German farmers, and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants.\n\nThe need of the [[North Carolina Railroad]] in the 1850s to locate land where they could build, repair and do maintenance on its track was the genesis of Burlington, North Carolina. The company selected a piece of land slightly west of present-day [[Graham, North Carolina|Graham]]. On January 29, 1856, the last spikes were driven into the final tie of the North Carolina Railroad project, uniting the cities of [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]] and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] by rail. The next day, the first locomotive passed along the new route. When the iron horse arrived in Alamance County, locals referred to it as \"the eighth wonder of the world\".\n[[File:Company Shops Train Depot.jpg|500px|thumb|left|Company Shops train depot]]\n\nNot long after this historic opening, the railroad realized a pressing need for repair shops. With Alamance County's position along the new line, it became the logical choice for the shops' location. After several debates concerning where the shops would be located, Gen. Benjamin Trollinger, a progressive Alamance County manufacturer, made an offer that settled the matter. Gen. Trollinger owned land just northwest of Graham, and he convinced several other prominent citizens owning adjacent lots to join him and sell their property to the railroad. 57 buildings were constructed between 1855 and 1859, including structures for engine and machine shops, carpentry, blacksmithing, houses for workers and railway officials, and company headquarters. For a brief period, railroad directors changed the name of Company Shops to Vance (1863-1864), but the town returned to the \"Company Shops\" moniker in July 1864, and officially incorporating as Company Shops in 1866.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/company-shops|title=\"Company Shops\"|last=Troxler|first=George|date=July 9, 2017|website=NCPedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Thirty-nine white men and two free African-Americans were employed in or around the shops, with twenty slaves constrained to assist. Sale of town lots soon started, but not surprisingly, the sale of lots was slow until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. By 1864, Company Shops numbered about 300 persons.\n\nThrough a series of leases and mergers, the railroad was leased to [[Richmond and Danville Railroad|Richmond & Danville Railroad]] (1871), working as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in 1893, the North Carolina Railroad was folded into the Southern Railway system. Following the leasing of the railroad to Richmond & Danville, many of the railroad jobs transferred to Richmond and Manchester. With the railroad shops no longer operated there, the citizens of Company Shops decided a new name was needed. In February 1887, an appointed committee for the town selected the name Burlington, and the name was officially changed through North Carolina State Legislature.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAround the turn of the century, E.M. Holt established small textile operations along the [[Haw River]] and Great Alamance Creek. In 1908, E.M. Holt built the first [[cotton mill]] in the South. From the establishment of this single factory, Alamance County grew to eventually operate 30 cotton mills and 10 to 15 yarn manufacturing plants employing 15,000 people. Eventually, the early textile venture of E.M. Holt became known all over the world as [[Burlington Industries]], and is now headquartered in nearby [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. Throughout this period, Burlington became a prosperous and vibrant little city filled with schools, churches, newspapers, telegraph and telephone lines, roads and a streetcar line{{emdash}}all in keeping with the latest \"modern progress\" of the times.\n\nThough textiles continued to dominate the local economy well into the 1970s, the people of Burlington knew they could not survive with only one industry. The country's involvement in World War II brought important local economic changes. In 1942, the federal government purchased and leased a {{convert|22|acre|adj=on}} site to [[Fairchild Aircraft]] Corporation for the construction of test aircraft. After two years of production, the site was leased to [[Firestone Tire Company]] for the Army's tank rebuilding program. At the close of the war, the federal government chose not to leave, but to utilize the property for government contract business. This decision would bring [[Western Electric]] to town along with new employees from around the country. Their contracts ensured Burlington's participation during the [[Cold War]] manufacturing and testing of emerging defense technologies. Four decades later (1991), however, the doors to Western Electric (then [[Lucent Technologies]]) were locked, and another chapter of Burlington\u2019s history was over.\n[[File:Historic train depot in downtown Burlington.jpg|thumb|412x412px|Historic train depot in downtown Burlington]]\nDuring this century-and-a-half of economic change, Burlington grew, adapted and prospered. Originally the center of commerce for Company Shops, the downtown area still serves as the heart of today's community with financial services, government services, an expanded library, small shops, eateries and a restored theater. Downtown has also returned to its status as a major employment center, becoming the home to [[LabCorp|Laboratory Corporation of America]], one of the world's largest biomedical testing firms and Burlington/Alamance County's largest employer.\n\nThe [[Alamance Hotel]], [[Allen House (Burlington, North Carolina)|Allen House]], [[Atlantic Bank and Trust Company Building]], [[Beverly Hills Historic District]], [[Downtown Burlington Historic District]], [[East Davis Street Historic District]], [[Efird Building]], [[First Baptist Church (Burlington, North Carolina)|First Baptist Church]], [[First Christian Church of Burlington]], [[Polly Fogleman House]], [[Holt-Frost House]], [[Horner Houses]], [[Lakeside Mills Historic District]], [[McCray School]], [[Menagerie Carousel]], [[Moore-Holt-White House]], [[South Broad-East Fifth Streets Historic District]], [[Southern Railway Passenger Station (Burlington, North Carolina)|Southern Railway Passenger Station]], [[St. Athanasius Episcopal Church and Parish House and the Church of the Holy Comforter]], [[Stagg House]], [[Sunny Side (Burlington, North Carolina)|Sunny Side]], [[United States Post Office (Burlington, North Carolina)|US Post Office]], [[West Davis Street-Fountain Place Historic District]], and [[Windsor Cotton Mills Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBurlington is located at {{Coord|36|5|23|N|79|26|44|W|type:city}} (36.089636, -79.445578).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nLocated in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, Burlington is characterized as having mostly flat land with a few rolling hills.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|65.7|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|65.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.5|km2|order=flip}}, or 0.82%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

He also works with bands as a studio producer, composes music for TV and film.\n\n==Biography==\nSchleibaum was born in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], grew up in and around the Washington, DC suburbs. Son to an ex-nun turned insurance claims adjuster and land developer, he started playing guitar at age 14. While a student at [[Robinson Secondary School]] in Fairfax, Virginia Schleibaum discovered punk and metal music and in his senior year founded Darkest Hour with lead singer John Henry.\nSchleibaum then attended [[George Mason University]] (Fairfax, Virginia), while continuing to tour and write with Darkest Hour. In 1999 Darkest Hour signed and was dropped from MIA records before their first full-length album, ''Mark of the Judas'', was officially released. In 2000, while still in college, Darkest Hour signed to Chicago's [[Victory Records]], and released ''So Sedated So Secure'' soon afterwards. After graduating in 2001 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Social Work, Schleibaum started pursuing Darkest Hour full-time. Darkest Hour has since gone on to record and release 6 full-length records, 2 EPs, and tour in over 32 countries and 5 continents.\n\nSchleibaum has had the opportunity to work with legendary metal producers: Fredrick Nordstrom (Studio Friedmen, Gothenburg Sweden), [[Devin Townsend]] (Greenhouse Studios, Vancouver, BC), and [[Brian McTernan]] (Salad Days Studios, Baltimore, Maryland).\n\nWith the help of his good friend and producer, [[Brian McTernan]], Schleibaum began producing and recording records in 2006. Many of the studio albums he has worked on were recorded at McTernan's Salad Days studios. In December 2007 Schleibaum produced his first major record for Dead To Fall, called ''Are You Serious?'' (Victory Records). He then worked with [[From Autumn to Ashes]] on their final record ''Holding a Wolf By the Ears'' (Vagrant Records). Schleibaum has also worked with artists: Destroy the Runner (Solid State), With Honor (Victory Records), These Green Eyes (Blackledge Music), Strike Anywhere (Bridge Nine), Thieves & Villains (Victory Records), and Domino Team (unsigned). Schleibaum also produced two of his personal projects Man and Wasp (featuring Frodus guitarist [[Shelby Cinca]]) and Washington DC's Beasts of No Nation.\nIn 2006 Schleibaum began composing music for TV documentaries, and continues to do so for several DC based companies, including: The Smithsonian Channels 2 hour WWII special \"Wings of Honor\" and \"Iwo Jima\u201d Specials, MSNBC's \"Charles Manson and His Followers,\" National Geographic's \"Behind the Photo,\" as well as the 13 part series \"Real Interrogations\" and \u201cThe Real NCIS\u201d currently airing on Investigation Discovery.\n\nIn 2008 Schleibaum launched www.askthedude.net. Drawing from his 15 years of life as a musician and unique social work background Schleibaum set out to provide self-help and advice for aspiring musicians and professional musicians alike. The site includes letters, interviews, gear reviews, and a band classifieds section.\n\nStarting August 2011 he will be the new columnist for Pulp Magazine.

He also works with bands as a studio producer, composes music for TV and film.\n\n==Biography==\nSchleibaum was born in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], grew up in and around the Washington, DC suburbs. Son to an ex-nun turned insurance claims adjuster and land developer, he started playing guitar at age 14. While a student at [[Robinson Secondary School]] in Fairfax, Virginia Schleibaum discovered punk and metal music and in his senior year founded Darkest Hour with lead singer John Henry.\nSchleibaum then attended [[George Mason University]] (Fairfax, Virginia), while continuing to tour and write with Darkest Hour. In 1999 Darkest Hour signed and was dropped from MIA records before their first full-length album, ''Mark of the Judas'', was officially released. In 2000, while still in college, Darkest Hour signed to Chicago's [[Victory Records]], and released ''So Sedated So Secure'' soon afterwards. After graduating in 2001 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Social Work, Schleibaum started pursuing Darkest Hour full-time. Darkest Hour has since gone on to record and release 6 full-length records, 2 EPs, and tour in over 32 countries and 5 continents.\n\nSchleibaum has had the opportunity to work with legendary metal producers: Fredrick Nordstrom (Studio Friedmen, Gothenburg Sweden), [[Devin Townsend]] (Greenhouse Studios, Vancouver, BC), and [[Brian McTernan]] (Salad Days Studios, Baltimore, Maryland).\n\nWith the help of his good friend and producer, [[Brian McTernan]], Schleibaum began producing and recording records in 2006. Many of the studio albums he has worked on were recorded at McTernan's Salad Days studios. In December 2007 Schleibaum produced his first major record for Dead To Fall, called ''Are You Serious?'' (Victory Records). He then worked with [[From Autumn to Ashes]] on their final record ''Holding a Wolf By the Ears'' (Vagrant Records). Schleibaum has also worked with artists: Destroy the Runner (Solid State), With Honor (Victory Records), These Green Eyes (Blackledge Music), Strike Anywhere (Bridge Nine), Thieves & Villains (Victory Records), and Domino Team (unsigned). Schleibaum also produced two of his personal projects Man and Wasp (featuring Frodus guitarist [[Shelby Cinca]]) and Washington DC's Beasts of No Nation.\nIn 2006 Schleibaum began composing music for TV documentaries, and continues to do so for several DC based companies, including: The Smithsonian Channels 2 hour WWII special \"Wings of Honor\" and \"Iwo Jima\u201d Specials, MSNBC's \"Charles Manson and His Followers,\" National Geographic's \"Behind the Photo,\" as well as the 13 part series \"Real Interrogations\" and \u201cThe Real NCIS\u201d currently airing on Investigation Discovery.\n\nIn 2008 Schleibaum launched www.askthedude.net. Drawing from his 15 years of life as a musician and unique social work background Schleibaum set out to provide self-help and advice for aspiring musicians and professional musicians alike. The site includes letters, interviews, gear reviews, and a band classifieds section.\n\nStarting August 2011 he will be the new columnist for Pulp Magazine. A Philippine-based rock and heavy metal magazine together with Paolo Gregletto of Trivium.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Current bands===\n*[[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]]\n*Zealot R.I.P\n*Be Well\n*Beasts of No Nation\n*Man and Wasp\n*[[Battery (hardcore punk band)|Battery]]\n\n===Former bands===\n*My Best Mistake\n*WD-40\n*Indivision\n*Astoria\n*The Bradshaw Express\n\n==Discography==\n*Darkest Hour: The Misanthrope (Death Truck Records / AF Records) CD EP /\n*Darkest Hour: The Prophecy Fulfilled (Art Monk Construction / AF Records) CD EP /\n*Darkest Hour: Darkest Hour/Ground Zero (East Coast Empire Records) Split 7 Inch /\n*Darkest Hour: Where Hero\u2019s Go To Die (Join the Team Player) 5 Inch Record /\n*Darkest Hour: Mark of the Judas (Join the Team Player, MIA, Art Monk Construction, Southern Loard) CD, LP /\n*Darkest Hour: So Sedated So Secure (Victory Records) CD LP /\n*Darkest Hour: Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation (Victory Records) CD LP /\n*Darkest Hour: Undoing Ruin (Victory Records) CD LP /\n*Darkest Hour: Deliver Us (Victory Records) CD LP /\n*Darkest Hour: The Eternal Return (Victory Records) CD LP /\n*Darkest Hour: The Human Romance (Victory Records) CD LP /\n*My Best Mistake: Demo (Self Released) CD /\n*Man And Wasp: EP (Self Released) CD /\n*Beasts of No Nation: TBA /\n*Dead To Fall\u2019s, Are You Serious?

Genres include [[Uk garage]], [[Drum and bass]], [[Dubstep]], [[2-step garage|2step]] and [[Grime (music)|grime]].\n\n==Festivals==\n[[Image:London - Notting Hill Carnival - Girl in Costume.jpg|thumb|right|Girl in costume at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]]]]\nLondon hosts several festivals, fairs and carnivals throughout the year with over 40 free festivals each year. The most famous is the [[Notting Hill Carnival]], the world's second largest carnival. The carnival takes place over the August bank holiday weekend, and attracts almost 1 million people.

In addition there are many smaller fairs and parades, including the [[Christmas Without Cruelty Fayre]], a fair held annually to promote [[animal rights]].\n\n[[File:Palace Theatre London.jpg|thumb|left|[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]] at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]]]]\n==Theatre and dance==\nThere are over three dozen major theatres, most concentrated in the [[West End of London|West End]] (see the articles West End theatre and [[List of London venues]]). West End theatres are commercial ventures that host predominantly Musical Theatre shows but genres such as comedy and serious drama are sometimes shown. The subsidised or non-commercial theatre is vibrant in the capital with theatres like the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and [[Shakespeare's Globe]] both of which are based on the [[South Bank]], the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] in the city, the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] which specialises in new drama, and the [[Old Vic]]; and [[Young Vic]], both in [[Lambeth]]. The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] which is based in [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]], presents seasons in London as well. Smaller fringe theatres like [[Battersea Arts Centre]], [[Bloomsbury Theatre]], [[Almeida Theatre]] and [[Tricycle Theatre]] are also popular.\n\nThe capital also boasts a successful dance and physical theatre scene, home to two ballet companies; the [[Royal Ballet]] based at the [[Royal Opera House]] and [[English National Ballet]] based in [[Kensington]], performing at the [[London Coliseum]]. [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] on Rosebery Avenue in [[Islington]] exclusively shows dance performances throughout the year ranging from existing and new [[Contemporary Dance|Contemporary]] companies, Musical Theatre, and touring ballet companies. Dance performances also take place at the [[Barbican Centre]], [[Peacock Theatre]] (Sadler's Wells), and the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]].

Other major collections of pre-1900 art are The [[Wallace Collection]]; the Courtauld Gallery at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]; and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]. The national collection of post-1900 art is at [[Tate Modern]] and the national collection of British Art is at [[Tate Britain]]. [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|The National Portrait Gallery]] has a major collection dedicated to prominent British people from all periods. The [[Royal Academy]]'s temporary exhibitions are also important.\n\nIn addition to [[Tate Modern]] major contemporary art venues include [[White Cube]], the [[Saatchi Gallery]], and The [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]].\n\n==Museums and art galleries==\n\n[[Image:British museum facade (1).jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the [[British Museum]]]]\n{{main|List of London museums}}\n\nLondon is home to over 240 museums,<ref>{{cite web|title=Culture of London|url=http://europe-cities.com/destinations/uk_england/cities/london/culture/|website=Europe-Cities|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref> galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major [[tourist attraction]]s as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the [[British Museum]] in [[Bloomsbury]], in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. Also of eighteenth-century foundation is the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]]; its [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibition]] has been an annual fixture on the London social calendar since 1769. In 1824 the [[National Gallery]] was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in [[Trafalgar Square]].\n\nIn the latter half of the nineteenth century the locale of [[South Kensington]] was developed as \"[[Albertopolis]]\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are located there: the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (for the [[applied arts|applied]] and [[Decorative arts]]), the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and the [[London Science Museum|Science Museum]]. The national gallery of British art is at [[Tate Britain]], originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to [[Tate Modern]], a new gallery housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]]. London's museums of military and maritime history also opened in the twentieth century: the [[Imperial War Museum]] in 1917, and the [[National Maritime Museum]] in 1934.\n\nLondon has several smaller museums of note. The [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] was the first purpose-built public art gallery in England, opening in 1817. Its architect, Sir [[John Soane]], turned his own house in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] into a museum and architectural showcase, known as the [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Soane Museum]]. The [[Wallace Collection]] is a notable small collection of [[Old Master]] paintings and furniture, with an emphasis on French works. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], which pioneered the study of [[art history]] in Britain from its foundation in 1932, is now located in [[Somerset House]], the former premises of the Royal Academy. The [[Museum of London]], charting the capital's history, has been located in the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] complex since 1976; a [[Museum of London Docklands|sister museum in the Docklands]] opened in 2003.\n\n==Libraries==\n[[File:Maughan-library-1.jpg|thumb|[[Maughan Library]], [[King's College London]]]]\n\nThe [[British Library]], located on [[Euston Road]] in [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] is the [[List of largest libraries|largest library in the world]].

The [[Royal Academy]]'s temporary exhibitions are also important.\n\nIn addition to [[Tate Modern]] major contemporary art venues include [[White Cube]], the [[Saatchi Gallery]], and The [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]].\n\n==Museums and art galleries==\n\n[[Image:British museum facade (1).jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the [[British Museum]]]]\n{{main|List of London museums}}\n\nLondon is home to over 240 museums,<ref>{{cite web|title=Culture of London|url=http://europe-cities.com/destinations/uk_england/cities/london/culture/|website=Europe-Cities|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref> galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major [[tourist attraction]]s as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the [[British Museum]] in [[Bloomsbury]], in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. Also of eighteenth-century foundation is the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]]; its [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibition]] has been an annual fixture on the London social calendar since 1769. In 1824 the [[National Gallery]] was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in [[Trafalgar Square]].\n\nIn the latter half of the nineteenth century the locale of [[South Kensington]] was developed as \"[[Albertopolis]]\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are located there: the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (for the [[applied arts|applied]] and [[Decorative arts]]), the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and the [[London Science Museum|Science Museum]]. The national gallery of British art is at [[Tate Britain]], originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to [[Tate Modern]], a new gallery housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]]. London's museums of military and maritime history also opened in the twentieth century: the [[Imperial War Museum]] in 1917, and the [[National Maritime Museum]] in 1934.\n\nLondon has several smaller museums of note. The [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] was the first purpose-built public art gallery in England, opening in 1817. Its architect, Sir [[John Soane]], turned his own house in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] into a museum and architectural showcase, known as the [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Soane Museum]]. The [[Wallace Collection]] is a notable small collection of [[Old Master]] paintings and furniture, with an emphasis on French works. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], which pioneered the study of [[art history]] in Britain from its foundation in 1932, is now located in [[Somerset House]], the former premises of the Royal Academy. The [[Museum of London]], charting the capital's history, has been located in the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] complex since 1976; a [[Museum of London Docklands|sister museum in the Docklands]] opened in 2003.\n\n==Libraries==\n[[File:Maughan-library-1.jpg|thumb|[[Maughan Library]], [[King's College London]]]]\n\nThe [[British Library]], located on [[Euston Road]] in [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] is the [[List of largest libraries|largest library in the world]].

railroad.

When the railroad did arrive, the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]], it built its depot at the present site of Burlington and those who had built in Old Burlington moved their buildings to the new townsite. Trains began running in 1888. \"The Settlement\", about 12 miles northwest of Burlington, was settled by [[Germans from Russia|German immigrants from Russia]], many from [[Tsebrykove|Hoffnungstal, South Russia]], who, in addition to their homesteads, built Congregational and Lutheran churches.<ref>[http://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=Colorado&BaseHref=KCC/1912/12/05&PageLabelPrint=1&EntityId=Ar00100&ViewMode=GIF \"Local and Personal Happenings] notice of a wedding at the Congregational church in the Settlement, page 1 ''Kit Carson County Record'' December 5, 1912</ref><ref>[http://www.bauderhistory.com/pdf/TheBirthoftheGermanSettlement.pdf The Birth of the German Settlement in Kit Carson County], from [http://www.bauderhistory.com/chapter4.html The German Settlement of Kit Carson County, Colorado]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBurlington is located at {{coord|39|18|15|N|102|16|7|W|type:city}} (39.304293, -102.268683)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> on the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] in eastern Colorado.

The Bura-Asinda system of settlements apparently covered the lower [[Niger River]] valley, including the [[Boura, Boulgou|Boura]] region of Burkina Faso. Further research is needed to understand the role this early [[civilization]] played in the [[ancient]] and [[medieval]] [[history of West Africa]].\n\n[[Lorop\u00e9ni]] is a pre-European stone ruin which was linked to the gold trade. It has been declared as Burkina Faso's first World Heritage site.\n\nFrom medieval times until the end of the 19th century, the region of Burkina Faso was ruled by the empire-building [[Mossi people]], who are believed to have come up to their present location from northern [[Ghana]], where the ethnically-related [[Dagomba people]] still live. For several centuries, Mossi peasants were both farmers and soldiers. During this time the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] successfully defended their territory, religious beliefs and social structure against forcible attempts at conquest and conversion by their [[Muslim]] neighbors to the northwest.\n\n==French Upper Volta==\n{{Main|French Upper Volta}}\n\nWhen the French troops of Kimberly arrived and claimed the area in 1896, Mossi resistance ended with the capture of their capital at [[Ouagadougou]]. In 1919, certain provinces from [[Ivory Coast]] were united into [[French Upper Volta]] in the [[French West Africa]] federation. In 1932, the new colony was split up for economic reasons; it was reconstituted in 1937 as an administrative division called the Upper Coast. After World War II, the Mossi actively pressured the French for separate territorial status and on September 4, 1947, Upper Volta became a French West African territory again in its own right.\n\nA revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of July 23, 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 that ensured a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on December 11, 1958. On July 11, 1960 France agreed to Upper Volta becoming fully independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F1FFD385A1A7A93C0A8178CD85F448685F9|title=4 AFRICAN STATES ATTAIN FREEDOM; France Gives Independence to Ivory Coast, Niger, Dahomey and Volta|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Republic of Upper Volta==\nThe [[Republic of Upper Volta]] declared independence on 5 August 1960. The first president, [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for 5-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yam\u00e9ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. Yam\u00e9ogo's government was viewed as corrupt and said to perpetuate [[neo-colonialism]] by favoring [[France|French]] political and economic interests which had allowed politicians to enrich themselves but not the nation's peasants or small class of urban workers.<ref>Benin, The Congo, Burkina Faso, Politics, Economics and Society, 1989, Joan Baxter and Keith Somerville, Pinter Publishers, London and New York, (Book)</ref>\n\nThe government lasted until 1966 when - after much unrest including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants - the military intervened and deposed Yam\u00e9ogo in the [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The coup leaders suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lieutenant Colonel [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for 4 years; on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a 4-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. He faced a major crisis in the form of the [[Sahel drought]] and was sent in 1973 to the UN and the US in order to secure aid.<ref>File:Nixon, Upper Volta President Lamizana - October 15, 1973(Gerald Ford Library)(1552621).pdf</ref> After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.\n\nLamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions and on November 25, 1980, Colonel [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.\n\nColonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later on November 7, 1982, by Major Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.\n\nInfighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January&nbsp;1983, but subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]], resulted in a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 4&nbsp;August 1983.\n\nThe coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption and anti-desertification projects.<ref name=\"UprightDVD2\">[http://newsreel.org/nav/title.asp?tc=CN0205 ''Thomas Sankara: The Upright Man''] by ''[[California Newsreel]]''</ref>\n\n==Burkina Faso==\nOn 4&nbsp;August 1984,<ref name=\"WDL1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> on President Sankara's initiative, the country's name was changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (''land of the upright/honest people'').<ref>Kingfisher Geography Encyclopedia. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}.

The [[Pioneers of the Revolution]] youth programme was also established.\n\nSankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent.<ref name=\"UprightDVD2\"/> His foreign policies were centred on [[anti-imperialism]], his government denying all [[foreign aid]], pushing for [[odious debt]] reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]].

The conflict ended after mediation by President [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny]] of [[Ivory Coast]]. The conflict is known as the \"Christmas war\" in Burkina Faso.\n\nMany of the strict austerity measures taken by Sankara met with growing resistance and disagreement. Despite his initial popularity and personal charisma, problems began to surface in the implementation of the revolutionary ideals.\n\n===Rule of Blaise Compaor\u00e9===\n[[Image:Pionniers de la r\u00e9volution.jpg|thumb|250px|Children of the 1983\u20131987 revolution]]\nThe CDRs, which were formed as popular mass organizations, deteriorated in some areas into gangs of armed thugs and clashed with several trade unions. Tensions over the repressive tactics of the government and its overall direction mounted steadily. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was [[assassination|assassinated]] in a coup which brought Captain [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] to power.\n[[File:Blaise Compaor\u00e9.jpeg|thumb|250px|Blaise Compaor\u00e9]]\n\nCompaor\u00e9, Captain [[Henri Zongo]], and Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lengani formed the Popular Front (FP), which pledged to continue and pursue the goals of the revolution and to \"rectify\" Sankara's \"deviations\" from the original aims. The new government, realizing the need for bourgeois support, tacitly moderated many of Sankara's policies. As part of a much-discussed political \"opening\" process, several political organizations, three of them non-Marxist, were accepted under an umbrella political organization created in June 1989 by the FP.\n\nSome members of the leftist [[Organisation pour la D\u00e9mocratie Populaire/Mouvement du Travail]] (ODP/MT) were against the admission of non-Marxist groups in the front. On September 18, 1989, while Compaor\u00e9 was returning from a two-week trip to Asia, Lengani and Zongo were accused of [[1989 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|plotting]] to overthrow the Popular Front. They were arrested and summarily executed the same night. Compaor\u00e9 reorganized the government, appointed several new ministers, and assumed the portfolio of Minister of Defense and Security. On December 23, 1989, a presidential security detail arrested about 30 civilians and military personnel accused of plotting a coup in collaboration with the Burkinabe external opposition.\n\nA new [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|constitution]], establishing the fourth republic, was adopted on June 2, 1991. Among other provisions, it called for an Assembly of People's Deputies with 107 seats (now 111). The president is chief of state, chairs a council of ministers, appoints a prime minister, who with the legislature's consent, serves as head of government. In April 2000, the constitution was amended reducing the presidential term from seven to five years, enforceable as of 2005, and allowing the president to be reelected only once. The legislative branch is a unicameral National Assembly (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) consisting of 111 seats. Members are elected by popular vote for five-year terms.\n\nIn April 2005, President Compaor\u00e9 was re\u2013elected for a third straight term. He won 80.3% of the vote, while [[Benewende Stanislas Sankara]] came a distant second with a mere 4.9%. In November 2010, President Compaor\u00e9 was re\u2013elected for a fourth straight term. He won 80.2% of the vote, while [[Hama Arba Diallo]] came a distant second with 8.2%.\n\nIn February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising in the entire country, lasting through April 2011, which was coupled with a military mutiny and with a strike of the magistrates. See {{Interlanguage link multi|2011 Burkina Faso uprising|fr|3=R\u00e9volte burkinab\u00e9e|vertical-align=sup}}.\n\n===Overthrow of Compaor\u00e9===\n{{main|2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising}}\nIn June 2014 Compaor\u00e9's ruling party, the CDP, called on him to organise a referendum that would allow him to alter the constitution in order to seek re-election in 2015; otherwise he would be forced to step down due to term limits.<ref>Burkina Faso ruling party calls for referendum on term limits, Africa, 22 June 2014, ENCA, http://www.enca.com/burkina-faso-ruling-party-calls-referendum-term-limits</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2014 the National Assembly was scheduled to debate an amendment to the constitution which would have enabled Compaor\u00e9 to stand for re-election as President in 2015. Opponents protested this by storming the parliament building in Ouagadougou, starting fires inside it and looting offices; billowing smoke was reported to be coming from the building by the BBC.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29831262 \"Burkina Faso parliament set ablaze\"].

The Bura-Asinda system of settlements apparently covered the lower [[Niger River]] valley, including the [[Boura, Boulgou|Boura]] region of Burkina Faso. Further research is needed to understand the role this early [[civilization]] played in the [[ancient]] and [[medieval]] [[history of West Africa]].\n\n[[Lorop\u00e9ni]] is a pre-European stone ruin which was linked to the gold trade. It has been declared as Burkina Faso's first World Heritage site.\n\nFrom medieval times until the end of the 19th century, the region of Burkina Faso was ruled by the empire-building [[Mossi people]], who are believed to have come up to their present location from northern [[Ghana]], where the ethnically-related [[Dagomba people]] still live. For several centuries, Mossi peasants were both farmers and soldiers. During this time the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] successfully defended their territory, religious beliefs and social structure against forcible attempts at conquest and conversion by their [[Muslim]] neighbors to the northwest.\n\n==French Upper Volta==\n{{Main|French Upper Volta}}\n\nWhen the French troops of Kimberly arrived and claimed the area in 1896, Mossi resistance ended with the capture of their capital at [[Ouagadougou]]. In 1919, certain provinces from [[Ivory Coast]] were united into [[French Upper Volta]] in the [[French West Africa]] federation. In 1932, the new colony was split up for economic reasons; it was reconstituted in 1937 as an administrative division called the Upper Coast. After World War II, the Mossi actively pressured the French for separate territorial status and on September 4, 1947, Upper Volta became a French West African territory again in its own right.\n\nA revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of July 23, 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 that ensured a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on December 11, 1958. On July 11, 1960 France agreed to Upper Volta becoming fully independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F1FFD385A1A7A93C0A8178CD85F448685F9|title=4 AFRICAN STATES ATTAIN FREEDOM; France Gives Independence to Ivory Coast, Niger, Dahomey and Volta|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Republic of Upper Volta==\nThe [[Republic of Upper Volta]] declared independence on 5 August 1960. The first president, [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for 5-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yam\u00e9ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. Yam\u00e9ogo's government was viewed as corrupt and said to perpetuate [[neo-colonialism]] by favoring [[France|French]] political and economic interests which had allowed politicians to enrich themselves but not the nation's peasants or small class of urban workers.<ref>Benin, The Congo, Burkina Faso, Politics, Economics and Society, 1989, Joan Baxter and Keith Somerville, Pinter Publishers, London and New York, (Book)</ref>\n\nThe government lasted until 1966 when - after much unrest including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants - the military intervened and deposed Yam\u00e9ogo in the [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The coup leaders suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lieutenant Colonel [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for 4 years; on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a 4-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. He faced a major crisis in the form of the [[Sahel drought]] and was sent in 1973 to the UN and the US in order to secure aid.<ref>File:Nixon, Upper Volta President Lamizana - October 15, 1973(Gerald Ford Library)(1552621).pdf</ref> After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.\n\nLamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions and on November 25, 1980, Colonel [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.\n\nColonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later on November 7, 1982, by Major Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.\n\nInfighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January&nbsp;1983, but subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]], resulted in a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 4&nbsp;August 1983.\n\nThe coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption and anti-desertification projects.<ref name=\"UprightDVD2\">[http://newsreel.org/nav/title.asp?tc=CN0205 ''Thomas Sankara: The Upright Man''] by ''[[California Newsreel]]''</ref>\n\n==Burkina Faso==\nOn 4&nbsp;August 1984,<ref name=\"WDL1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> on President Sankara's initiative, the country's name was changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (''land of the upright/honest people'').<ref>Kingfisher Geography Encyclopedia. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}.

The conflict ended after mediation by President [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny]] of [[Ivory Coast]]. The conflict is known as the \"Christmas war\" in Burkina Faso.\n\nMany of the strict austerity measures taken by Sankara met with growing resistance and disagreement. Despite his initial popularity and personal charisma, problems began to surface in the implementation of the revolutionary ideals.\n\n===Rule of Blaise Compaor\u00e9===\n[[Image:Pionniers de la r\u00e9volution.jpg|thumb|250px|Children of the 1983\u20131987 revolution]]\nThe CDRs, which were formed as popular mass organizations, deteriorated in some areas into gangs of armed thugs and clashed with several trade unions. Tensions over the repressive tactics of the government and its overall direction mounted steadily. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was [[assassination|assassinated]] in a coup which brought Captain [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] to power.\n[[File:Blaise Compaor\u00e9.jpeg|thumb|250px|Blaise Compaor\u00e9]]\n\nCompaor\u00e9, Captain [[Henri Zongo]], and Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lengani formed the Popular Front (FP), which pledged to continue and pursue the goals of the revolution and to \"rectify\" Sankara's \"deviations\" from the original aims. The new government, realizing the need for bourgeois support, tacitly moderated many of Sankara's policies. As part of a much-discussed political \"opening\" process, several political organizations, three of them non-Marxist, were accepted under an umbrella political organization created in June 1989 by the FP.\n\nSome members of the leftist [[Organisation pour la D\u00e9mocratie Populaire/Mouvement du Travail]] (ODP/MT) were against the admission of non-Marxist groups in the front. On September 18, 1989, while Compaor\u00e9 was returning from a two-week trip to Asia, Lengani and Zongo were accused of [[1989 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|plotting]] to overthrow the Popular Front. They were arrested and summarily executed the same night. Compaor\u00e9 reorganized the government, appointed several new ministers, and assumed the portfolio of Minister of Defense and Security. On December 23, 1989, a presidential security detail arrested about 30 civilians and military personnel accused of plotting a coup in collaboration with the Burkinabe external opposition.\n\nA new [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|constitution]], establishing the fourth republic, was adopted on June 2, 1991. Among other provisions, it called for an Assembly of People\u2019s Deputies with 107 seats (now 111). The president is chief of state, chairs a council of ministers, appoints a prime minister, who with the legislature\u2019s consent, serves as head of government. In April 2000, the constitution was amended reducing the presidential term from seven to five years, enforceable as of 2005, and allowing the president to be reelected only once. The legislative branch is a unicameral National Assembly (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) consisting of 111 seats. Members are elected by popular vote for five-year terms.\n\nIn April 2005, President Compaor\u00e9 was re\u2013elected for a third straight term. He won 80.3% of the vote, while [[Benewende Stanislas Sankara]] came a distant second with a mere 4.9%. In November 2010, President Compaor\u00e9 was re\u2013elected for a fourth straight term. He won 80.2% of the vote, while [[Hama Arba Diallo]] came a distant second with 8.2%.\n\nIn February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising in the entire country, lasting through April 2011, which was coupled with a military mutiny and with a strike of the magistrates. See {{Interlanguage link multi|2011 Burkina Faso uprising|fr|3=R\u00e9volte burkinab\u00e9e|vertical-align=sup}}.\n\n===Overthrow of Compaor\u00e9===\n{{main|2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising}}\nIn June 2014 Compaor\u00e9's ruling party, the CDP, called on him to organise a referendum that would allow him to alter the constitution in order to seek re-election in 2015; otherwise he would be forced to step down due to term limits.<ref>Burkina Faso ruling party calls for referendum on term limits, Africa, 22 June 2014, ENCA, http://www.enca.com/burkina-faso-ruling-party-calls-referendum-term-limits</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2014 the National Assembly was scheduled to debate an amendment to the constitution which would have enabled Compaor\u00e9 to stand for re-election as President in 2015.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.
