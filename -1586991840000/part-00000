This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is a common form of corruption. The types of favours given are diverse and may include money, gifts, sexual favours, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last= Wang\n|first= Peng\n|title= The rise of the Red Mafia in China: a case study of organised crime and corruption in Chongqing\n|journal= Trends in Organized Crime\n|year= 2013\n|volume= 16\n|issue= 1\n|pages= 49\u201373\n|doi= 10.1007/s12117-012-9179-8\n}}\n</ref>\n\nBribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.\n\n===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===\n{{main|Embezzlement}}\n[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.\n\nExamples include the misdirection of company funds into \"shadow companies\" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.\n\n===Graft===\n{{main|Graft (politics)}}\nThe political act of '''graft''' is when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected to maximize the benefits to private interests of the corrupt individuals.\n\n===Extortion and blackmail===\n{{main|Extortion}}\nWhile [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.\n\nThis includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.\n\n===Influence peddling===\n[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favors or preferential treatment, usually in return for payment.\n\n===Networking===\n{{main|Business networking}}\nNetworking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|date=30 September 2013|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009201017/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=467\u2013478|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:9 - euro bank notes hidden in sleeve - white background - royalty free, without copyright, public domain photo image.JPG|{{largethumb}}|Euro bank notes hidden in sleeve.]]\n\n===Abuse of discretion===\n{{main|Abuse of discretion}}\n[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities.

Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.\n\nIn 1969,{{efn|In 1962, a letter writing campaign attempted but ultimately failed to prevent the construction of the [[Watergate complex#Approval controversies|Watergate complex]] on the grounds that zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor.}} Christian anarchist [[Dorothy Day]] argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption.

There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].\n\nAs early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>\nBased on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|website=oecd.org}}</ref> have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan M.|last2=Malesky|first2=Edmund J.|title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|journal=International Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=33\u201369|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|language=en|issn=0020-8183|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a document<ref name=\"partnerplatform\">{{cite web|url=http://partnerplatform.org/?7vz3z60x |title=Forgues-Puccio, G.F.

They found:\n* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.\n* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.\n* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.\n* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.\n* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.\n* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.<ref name=\"partnerplatform\"

Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:\n* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition\n* They must be common in the industry\n* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year\n* Payments must be appropriate\n* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).\nIn the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.\n\nDenmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.\n\nFrance: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and are associated with the following disadvantages:\n* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.\n* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.\n* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.\n\nJapan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nCanada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.\n\nLuxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nNetherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.\n\nAustria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.\n\nSwitzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.\n\nUS: (rough r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\")\n\nUK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient.\"\n\n====\"Specific\" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====\nReferring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,<ref name=study /> the then Kohl administration (1991\u20131994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions<ref>the term \"official\" had been limited to German jurisdiction.

Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts\u2014unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others.

He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.<ref>Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d</ref>''\n\nThe [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2|\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]])<ref>2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.</ref> and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit \"unspotted from the world.\"<ref>James 1:27.</ref> [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably \"deal with the world,\"<ref>1 Cor 7:31.</ref> and recommends they adopt an attitude of \"as if not\" in all their dealings.

This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is a common form of corruption.

[[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.\n\nExamples include the misdirection of company funds into \"shadow companies\" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.\n\n===Graft===\n{{main|Graft (politics)}}\nThe political act of '''graft''' is when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected to maximize the benefits to private interests of the corrupt individuals.\n\n===Extortion and blackmail===\n{{main|Extortion}}\nWhile [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.\n\nThis includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.\n\n===Influence peddling===\n[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favors or preferential treatment, usually in return for payment.\n\n===Networking===\n{{main|Business networking}}\nNetworking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market.

This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|date=30 September 2013|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009201017/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=467\u2013478|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:9 - euro bank notes hidden in sleeve - white background - royalty free, without copyright, public domain photo image.JPG|{{largethumb}}|Euro bank notes hidden in sleeve.]]\n\n===Abuse of discretion===\n{{main|Abuse of discretion}}\n[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities.

Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.\n\nIn 1969,{{efn|In 1962, a letter writing campaign attempted but ultimately failed to prevent the construction of the [[Watergate complex#Approval controversies|Watergate complex]] on the grounds that zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor.}} Christian anarchist [[Dorothy Day]] argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption.

There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].\n\nAs early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>\nBased on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999.

They found:\n* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.\n* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.\n* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.\n* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.\n* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.\n* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity.

extreme cases as in Germany, where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.\nThe German Parliamentary Financial Commission rejected a Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition, which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA from 1977), thus fostering national export corporations.<ref>[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] \"Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD

(Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).<ref name=study />\n\nBelgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:\n* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition\n* They must be common in the industry\n* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year\n* Payments must be appropriate\n* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).\nIn the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.\n\nDenmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.\n\nFrance: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and are associated with the following disadvantages:\n* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.\n* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.\n* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.\n\nJapan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nCanada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.\n\nLuxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nNetherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.\n\nAustria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.\n\nSwitzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.\n\nUS: (rough r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\")\n\nUK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient.\"\n\n====\"Specific\" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====\nReferring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,<ref name=study /> the then Kohl administration (1991\u20131994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions<ref>the term \"official\" had been limited to German jurisdiction.

[[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers \"shelter behind a wall\" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.\n\n''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts\u2014unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.<ref>Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d</ref>''\n\nThe [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2|\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]])<ref>2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.</ref> and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit \"unspotted from the world.\"<ref>James 1:27.</ref> [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably \"deal with the world,\"<ref>1 Cor 7:31.</ref> and recommends they adopt an attitude of \"as if not\" in all their dealings.

It is based in Canberra to provide an active connection between the business sector and government departments and ACIO.<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood\"/> In October 1988, the Taiwan Market Service (TMS) was created to establish an Australian equivalent to the ACIO in Taiwan.<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood\">Gary Klintwood, Modern Taiwan in the 1990s, Canberra papers on Strategy and Defence N0 75 (Canberra: Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, 1991), p.189.</ref>\n\nIn March 1990, an Australian education centre was created in Taipei to promote mutual student and cultural exchange.<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood\"/> In addition, since 1989 Taiwan began focusing on a policy of 'flexible diplomacy,' which included an emphasis on creating informal relations or 'substantial relations' rather than formal diplomatic relations.<ref name=\"JurgenDomes\">Jurgen Domes, \u2018Taiwan in 1991: Searching for Political Consensus,\u2019 Asian Survey 32.1 (1991)</ref> This policy was embodied in the creation of [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices]] in various countries, with more than 50 such offices currently located around the world.<ref name=\"JurgenDomes\"/>\n\nAustralia and Taiwan used other documents that were not technically legally binding to develop their unofficial relationship.

This includes establishing direct air links with Taiwan in 1991, which saw an increase in tourism resulting in Taiwan becoming Australia\u2019s third largest market in Asia.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_a\"/> The period to receive an Australian visa in Taiwan was reduced to 48 hours,<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood_a\" /> and a memorandum of understanding was agreed relating to \u2018the promotion of investment and technology transfer and to the protection of intellectual property\u2019.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_a\"/>\n\nPolitical and cultural links also improved.

The PRC fired missiles close to Taiwan in an attempt to influence Taiwanese political elections.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/> Australia\u2019s response to the crisis was that Beijing should exercise \u2018constraint\u2019.<ref name=\"Austin\">Austin, G., ed., 1997.

This was achieved through a series of ministerial and official visits by Australian diplomats, politicians and other government representatives. In September 1996, the chief of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF), [[John Baker (general)|General John Baker]], visited China to seek an \u2018upgrade in Sino-Australian exchanges on defence and strategic issues as a \u2018confidence-building\u2019 measure.\u2019<ref>McGregor, R. 1996. 'ADF Chief seeks to reassure Beijing'. ''Australian'', 27 September</ref> This culminated in an agreement in 1997 to start a range of annual PRC-Australia talks focused on security within the Asia Pacific region. In addition, there were agreements for the exchange of military professionals and officials to attend each other's strategic studies Institutes.<ref>Greenlees, D. and McGregor, R. 1996. \u2018Downer Warns China Over War Games.\u2019 Australian, 13 March</ref> When Howard visited the PRC, he not only stressed Australia's stand on the One-China policy, but also emphasised that Australia's national interests would be decided independently of US policy direction.\n\nIn the later 1990s, Australia's relations with Taiwan were largely influenced by what has been called the \u2018Armitage Scenario'.<ref name=\"William\">William T. Tow, \"Australia, the United States and a \u2018China Growing Strong\u2019:Managing Conflict Avoidance\", Department of Government, The University of Queensland (Paper for: The annual Australasian Political Science Association Conference Canberra ACT, 4\u20136 October 2000)</ref> In 1999, [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], former [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs|US Assistant Secretary of Defence]], visited Australia and expressed that should a conflict arise, the United States would \u2018demand Australian support, including military support if demanded.\u2019<ref name=\"William\"/> If Australia did not agree to this arrangement, [[ANZUS]] would be concluded. This placed Australia in a precarious position with the PRC, which was encompassed in a statement released by an aide of [[Jiang Zemin]], saying that Australia faced \u2018very serious consequences\u2019 if it sided with the US in a future Taiwan conflict.<ref name=\"William\"/> Following those events, Jiang made a state visit to Australia, during which Howard reassured him Australia still followed the One-China policy.<ref>(Hartcher 1999)</ref>\n\nThis placed Australia in a complicated political situation, as Australia was still trying to retain its economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan. This led to Howard implementing a 'dual policy' towards the China-Taiwan issue, in which it encouraged the PRC to \u2018exercise restraint in issuing threats of using military force against Taiwan.\u2019  This was emphasised by Australian government officials, particularly from [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]], when they met with the [[Ambassadors of the People's Republic of China|PRC's Ambassador]] to Australia to express their concern over a [[white paper]] intimating the PRC would employ force against Taiwan if it failed to negotiate unification expeditiously.\n\n==Future of Australia\u2013Taiwan relations==\n\nWhile there has been substantial development in terms of cultural and other unofficial links, Australia's policy towards Taiwan is still largely dictated by Australia's recognition of the People's Republic of China.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_b\"/> However, Australia does have long term concerns about the potential for a future military conflict between Taiwan and the PRC which would create uncertainty and instability in Australia's sphere of influence.<ref name=\"AnthonyVan\"/> From the perspective of Taiwan, Australia was its eighth largest source of imports and thirteenth market for exports in 2000, making Australia its eleventh largest trading partner.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/> The current relationship between Australia and Taiwan functions on two fundamental understandings. First, both Australia and Taiwan recognise it is an unofficial relationship. Secondly, Taiwan is 'careful not to embarrass Australia' and to adhere to the mutual understandings that have been agreed upon.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Australian Office in Taipei]]\n* [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Foreign relations of Australia}}\n{{Foreign relations of the Republic of China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Australia-Taiwan relations}}\n[[Category:Australia\u2013Taiwan relations| ]]\n[[Category:Bilateral relations of Australia|Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Bilateral relations of Taiwan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|1=Diplomatic relations between Australia and Taiwan}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=February 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox Bilateral relations|Australia\u2013Taiwan|Australia|Taiwan|mission1=[[Australian Office in Taipei]]|mission2=[[Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia]]|map=Australia\u2013Taiwan Locator.svg}}\nRelations between the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] and the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) date back to 1909 when the latter was ruled by the [[Qing dynasty]].

In 1981, the Australian Commerce and Industry office (ACIO) was established in Taiwan, which acted as an unofficial organisation for trade representatives, as well as tourist promotion and visa application. It is based in Canberra to provide an active connection between the business sector and government departments and ACIO.<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood\"/> In October 1988, the Taiwan Market Service (TMS) was created to establish an Australian equivalent to the ACIO in Taiwan.<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood\">Gary Klintwood, Modern Taiwan in the 1990s, Canberra papers on Strategy and Defence N0 75 (Canberra: Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, 1991), p.189.</ref>\n\nIn March 1990, an Australian education centre was created in Taipei to promote mutual student and cultural exchange.<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood\"/> In addition, since 1989 Taiwan began focusing on a policy of 'flexible diplomacy,' which included an emphasis on creating informal relations or 'substantial relations' rather than formal diplomatic relations.<ref name=\"JurgenDomes\">Jurgen Domes, \u2018Taiwan in 1991: Searching for Political Consensus,\u2019 Asian Survey 32.1 (1991)</ref> This policy was embodied in the creation of [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices]] in various countries, with more than 50 such offices currently located around the world.<ref name=\"JurgenDomes\"/>\n\nAustralia and Taiwan used other documents that were not technically legally binding to develop their unofficial relationship.

The incident reportedly shocked Australia and Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] publicly cried at the memorial service for the victims who were killed.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/> Another factor that contributed to closer unofficial relations was the 'democratisation' of Taiwan.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/> Legislation was passed to protect Taiwanese investment products in Australia, as the Taiwanese government feared that the PRC may claim them.<ref>Gary Klintwood, Australia\u2019s Taiwan Policy 1942 to 1992 (Australia: Australian National University, 1993), p. 106.</ref>  \n\nAustralia's trade with Taiwan in 1993 amounted to $5.1 billion, while trade with the PRC was slightly greater at $5.2 billion.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_a\">Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, Australia Taiwan Bilateral Relations (Report of a visit to Taiwan of Australian Parliament: July 1994)</ref> In 1992, Taiwan was Australia\u2019s fourth-largest Asian trading partner and seventh most important overall.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_a\"/> Despite Taiwan\u2019s inability to conclude multilateral treaties, Australia has concluded various bilateral agreements with Taiwan. This includes establishing direct air links with Taiwan in 1991, which saw an increase in tourism resulting in Taiwan becoming Australia\u2019s third largest market in Asia.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_a\"/> The period to receive an Australian visa in Taiwan was reduced to 48 hours,<ref name=\"GaryKlintwood_a\" /> and a memorandum of understanding was agreed relating to \u2018the promotion of investment and technology transfer and to the protection of intellectual property\u2019.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_a\"/>\n\nPolitical and cultural links also improved.

The PRC fired missiles close to Taiwan in an attempt to influence Taiwanese political elections.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/> Australia\u2019s response to the crisis was that Beijing should exercise \u2018constraint\u2019.<ref name=\"Austin\">Austin, G., ed., 1997. Missile Diplomacy and Taiwan\u2019s Future: Innovations in Politics and Military Power. Canberra Papers on Strategy and Defence No.122. Canberra: Strategic and Defence Studies Centre.</ref> This was expressed by [[Alexander Downer]], who had recently been appointed [[Foreign Minister of Australia|Foreign Minister]] in the [[John Howard|Howard]] government. Australia supported the US reaction of deploying two aircraft carriers to the east of Taiwan.<ref name=\"Austin\"/> These events caused tension with the PRC, as they perceived that the US was executing a \u2018new containment strategy in which Australia and Japan were anchors.\u2019<ref>Richardson, M. 1996. \u2018\u2019Neighbours strike neutral pose for fear of aggravating Beijing.\u2019 Australian, 13 March.</ref> Consequently, [[Australia-China relations]] suffered during this period, demonstrating the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue.\n\nFollowing the crisis, the Howard government attempted to strengthen relations with the PRC, resulting in reaffirming its One-China policy stance. This was achieved through a series of ministerial and official visits by Australian diplomats, politicians and other government representatives. In September 1996, the chief of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF), [[John Baker (general)|General John Baker]], visited China to seek an \u2018upgrade in Sino-Australian exchanges on defence and strategic issues as a \u2018confidence-building\u2019 measure.\u2019<ref>McGregor, R. 1996. 'ADF Chief seeks to reassure Beijing'. ''Australian'', 27 September</ref> This culminated in an agreement in 1997 to start a range of annual PRC-Australia talks focused on security within the Asia Pacific region. In addition, there were agreements for the exchange of military professionals and officials to attend each other's strategic studies Institutes.<ref>Greenlees, D. and McGregor, R. 1996. \u2018Downer Warns China Over War Games.\u2019 Australian, 13 March</ref> When Howard visited the PRC, he not only stressed Australia's stand on the One-China policy, but also emphasised that Australia's national interests would be decided independently of US policy direction.\n\nIn the later 1990s, Australia's relations with Taiwan were largely influenced by what has been called the \u2018Armitage Scenario'.<ref name=\"William\">William T. Tow, \"Australia, the United States and a \u2018China Growing Strong\u2019:Managing Conflict Avoidance\", Department of Government, The University of Queensland (Paper for: The annual Australasian Political Science Association Conference Canberra ACT, 4\u20136 October 2000)</ref> In 1999, [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], former [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs|US Assistant Secretary of Defence]], visited Australia and expressed that should a conflict arise, the United States would \u2018demand Australian support, including military support if demanded.\u2019<ref name=\"William\"/> If Australia did not agree to this arrangement, [[ANZUS]] would be concluded. This placed Australia in a precarious position with the PRC, which was encompassed in a statement released by an aide of [[Jiang Zemin]], saying that Australia faced \u2018very serious consequences\u2019 if it sided with the US in a future Taiwan conflict.<ref name=\"William\"/> Following those events, Jiang made a state visit to Australia, during which Howard reassured him Australia still followed the One-China policy.<ref>(Hartcher 1999)</ref>\n\nThis placed Australia in a complicated political situation, as Australia was still trying to retain its economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan. This led to Howard implementing a 'dual policy' towards the China-Taiwan issue, in which it encouraged the PRC to \u2018exercise restraint in issuing threats of using military force against Taiwan.\u2019  This was emphasised by Australian government officials, particularly from [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]], when they met with the [[Ambassadors of the People's Republic of China|PRC's Ambassador]] to Australia to express their concern over a [[white paper]] intimating the PRC would employ force against Taiwan if it failed to negotiate unification expeditiously.\n\n==Future of Australia\u2013Taiwan relations==\n\nWhile there has been substantial development in terms of cultural and other unofficial links, Australia's policy towards Taiwan is still largely dictated by Australia's recognition of the People's Republic of China.<ref name=\"Parliamentof_b\"/> However, Australia does have long term concerns about the potential for a future military conflict between Taiwan and the PRC which would create uncertainty and instability in Australia's sphere of influence.<ref name=\"AnthonyVan\"/> From the perspective of Taiwan, Australia was its eighth largest source of imports and thirteenth market for exports in 2000, making Australia its eleventh largest trading partner.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/> The current relationship between Australia and Taiwan functions on two fundamental understandings. First, both Australia and Taiwan recognise it is an unofficial relationship. Secondly, Taiwan is 'careful not to embarrass Australia' and to adhere to the mutual understandings that have been agreed upon.<ref name=\"ThomasNicholasReOrientating\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Australian Office in Taipei]]\n* [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Foreign relations of Australia}}\n{{Foreign relations of the Republic of China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Australia-Taiwan relations}}\n[[Category:Australia\u2013Taiwan relations| ]]\n[[Category:Bilateral relations of Australia|Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Bilateral relations of Taiwan]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%E2%80%93Taiwan_relations"}

together to write and create music. They began out by re-recording the song \"More than a Love Song\" which Dan had written for his high school girlfriend while living in California. They originally wanted to call themselves The Looking Glass, but after discovering another band of the same name they chose \"Augustana\" instead. A full-length debut album, ''Midwest Skies and Sleepless Mondays'' was recorded in the home recording studio of Jon King.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Augustana - Midwest Skies And Sleepless Mondays|url = http://www.discogs.com/Augustana-Midwest-Skies-And-Sleepless-Mondays/release/6223817|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}</ref> The album was released in the Spring of 2003 and only 1000 copies were produced, however, early buzz and reviews were primarily positive.

The club's home ground is the [[Kalevi Keskstaadion|Kalev Keskstaadion]].\n\nFormed as Meteor in 1909, the club changed its name to Kalev in 1911 after joining the [[Estonian Sports Association Kalev]]. The club were founding members of the Estonian Football Championship in [[1921 Estonian Football Championship|1921]]. Kalev have won three league championship titles, in [[1923 Estonian Football Championship|1923]], [[1930 Estonian Football Championship|1930]] and [[1955 Estonian SSR Football Championship|1955]]. The club was re-established in 2002 and has played in the Meistriliiga since 2018.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nKalev's origins lie with [[FC Meteor Tallinn|Meteor]]. Jalgpalliselts Meteor (Football Association Meteor) was formed in 1909 by students Julius Reinans and Bernhard Abrams. The team was first coached by a Scottish flax merchant John Stormonth Urquhart who also ordered the team's first uniforms, consisting of blue shirts and white shorts. The team included several players who would become notable athletes, such as future [[Estonia national football team|Estonia national team]] players Voldemar Luik and Otto Silber and Olympic runner [[Johannes Villemson]]. On 6 June 1909, Meteor and Merkuur played the first official football match in Estonia. The match took place at the grounds behind the Lower Lighthouse in [[Lasnam\u00e4e]] and was won by Meteor 4\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=840408.html|last=Malkin|first=Mikhail|publisher=UEFA.com|title=Estonia toasting 100 years of football|date=22 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1911, Meteor joined the [[Estonian Sports Association Kalev]] and changed its name to Kalev. In 1913, the team moved to the new Tiigiveski Ground.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Estonian champions===\n[[File:Kalev1.jpg|thumb|left|The 1923 Kalev team, who won the club's first league title]]\nIn the 1920s, the newly formed Estonian Football Championship was dominated by Tallinn sides Kalev, [[SK Tallinna Sport|Sport]] and [[Tallinna Jalgpalliklubi|TJK]]. The derby matches between the clubs drew thousands of spectators. Kalev won their first league title in [[1923 Estonian Football Championship|1923]]. The team included Estonian internationals such as [[Eduard Ellman-Eelma|Eduard Ellmann]], [[Ernst Joll]], [[Elmar Kaljot]], [[August Lass]] and [[Arnold Pihlak]], who went on to represent Estonia at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. On 16 August 1925, the team suffered a serious setback when the board of the association expelled eight key players from the squad over their decision to play in the opening match of TJK's new ground without the board's permission. The players subsequently joined TJK.<ref name=\"top10\">{{cite web|title=Top 10 - meistriliiga \u0161okeerivaimad juhtumid 1921-1940|publisher=Soccernet.ee|url=http://soccernet.ee/artikkel/top-10-meistriliiga-sokeerivaimad-juhtumid-1921-19401|language=Estonian|date=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Kalev1930.jpg|thumb|right|Kalev's championship-winning team in 1930]]\nTallinna Kalev won their second championship in the controversial [[1930 Estonian Football Championship|1930 season]]. Although never proven officially, the victory was widely accepted as a result of [[match fixing]]. To win the title, Kalev needed to win the final game of the season against the formidable [[KS V\u00f5itleja Narva|Narva V\u00f5itleja]] by eight goals and went on to win the match 11\u20130. V\u00f5itleja's performance was so poor that allegations of match fixing began instantly, with Kalev board member Aleksander M\u00e4ndvere being accused of bribing V\u00f5itleja players, particularly the team's goalkeeper Viruvere.<ref name=\"top10\"/>\n\nKalev reached the [[1939 Estonian Cup]] final, but lost to TJK 1\u20134.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Kalev in Soviet football===\n[[File:Kalev5.jpg|thumb|right|Kalev team in 1961]]\nFollowing [[World War II]] and the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia]], Kalev joined the [[Soviet Union football league system]], competing in the [[Soviet First League|second tier]] of Soviet football from 1947 to 1954, while Kalev's second team played in the Estonian championship. In [[1955 Estonian SSR Football Championship|1955]], Kalev's first team returned to the Estonian championship, winning their third league title. In 1960, Kalev joined [[Soviet Top League|Class A]], the top flight of Soviet football. The team finished their [[1960 Soviet Top League|first season]] in Class A in 19th place out of 22 teams. In the [[1961 Soviet Top League|1961 season]], Kalev finished last and were relegated to Class B.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Re-establishment===\n[[File:Kooseis 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Kalev team in 2017]]\nTallinna Kalev was re-established on 1 September 2002 and joined the [[Estonian football league system]]. The club won the Northern division of the [[III liiga]] in 2003. In 2004, [[Aavo Sarap]] was appointed as manager and Tallinna Kalev won the East/North division of the [[II liiga]]. The club finished the [[2006 Esiliiga]] in third place and were promoted to the [[Meistriliiga]], returning the top flight of Estonian football. Tallinna Kalev finished the [[2007 Meistriliiga|2007 season]] in sixth place. In August 2009, Sarap's contract was terminated and he was replaced by his assistant Daniel Meijel. The team finished the [[2009 Meistriliiga|2009 season]] in last place and were relegated.\n\nIn January 2010, [[Sergei Ratnikov]] was appointed as manager. Tallinna Kalev won the [[2011 Esiliiga]] were promoted back to the Meistriliiga. The club finished the [[2012 Meistriliiga|2012 season]] in ninth place, but avoided being relegated by defeating [[Rakvere JK Tarvas|Tarvas]] 3\u20131 on aggregate in the relegation play-offs. In December 2012, [[Frank Bernhardt]] was appointed as manager. Tallinna Kalev finished the [[2013 Meistriliiga|2013 season]] in eighth place. In January 2014, former Estonia national team manager [[Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli]] took over as manager. R\u00fc\u00fctli subsequently left in March 2014 and Sergei Zamogiln\u00f5i took over as manager. Following a disappointing [[2014 Meistriliiga|2014 season]], where Tallinna Kalev finished in 10th place and were relegated to the Esiliiga once again, Zamogiln\u00f5i was replaced by Marko P\u00e4rnpuu. Tallinna Kalev returned to the Meistriliiga after finishing the [[2017 Esiliiga|2017 season]] as runners-up. In November 2017, P\u00e4rnupuu was replaced by [[Argo Arbeiter]]. The team finished the [[2018 Meistriliiga|2018 season]] in eighth place, after which Arbeiter left and [[Aleksandr Dmitrijev]] took over as manager.\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:XIX \u00fcldtantsupidu, ettevalmistused 01.JPG|thumb|right|Kalev Keskstaadion]]\n{{main|Kalevi Keskstaadion}}\nThe club's home ground is the 11,500-seat Kalev Keskstaadion. Opened on 12 July 1955, the [[multi-purpose stadium]] was built near Kalev's old Tiigiveski Ground. Initially named Kalev Komsomol Stadium, the name was changed to Kalev Keskstaadion in 1989. It used to be the largest football stadium in Estonia until the completion of [[A. Le Coq Arena]] in 2001.

known as '''Tallinna Kalev''' or simply '''Kalev''', is a [[Football team|football club]] based in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, that competes in the [[Meistriliiga]], the top flight of [[Estonian football league system|Estonian football]]. The club's home ground is the [[Kalevi Keskstaadion|Kalev Keskstaadion]].\n\nFormed as Meteor in 1909, the club changed its name to Kalev in 1911 after joining the [[Estonian Sports Association Kalev]]. The club were founding members of the Estonian Football Championship in [[1921 Estonian Football Championship|1921]]. Kalev have won three league championship titles, in [[1923 Estonian Football Championship|1923]], [[1930 Estonian Football Championship|1930]] and [[1955 Estonian SSR Football Championship|1955]]. The club was re-established in 2002 and has played in the Meistriliiga since 2018.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nKalev's origins lie with [[FC Meteor Tallinn|Meteor]]. Jalgpalliselts Meteor (Football Association Meteor) was formed in 1909 by students Julius Reinans and Bernhard Abrams. The team was first coached by a Scottish flax merchant John Stormonth Urquhart who also ordered the team's first uniforms, consisting of blue shirts and white shorts. The team included several players who would become notable athletes, such as future [[Estonia national football team|Estonia national team]] players Voldemar Luik and Otto Silber and Olympic runner [[Johannes Villemson]]. On 6 June 1909, Meteor and Merkuur played the first official football match in Estonia. The match took place at the grounds behind the Lower Lighthouse in [[Lasnam\u00e4e]] and was won by Meteor 4\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=840408.html|last=Malkin|first=Mikhail|publisher=UEFA.com|title=Estonia toasting 100 years of football|date=22 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1911, Meteor joined the [[Estonian Sports Association Kalev]] and changed its name to Kalev. In 1913, the team moved to the new Tiigiveski Ground.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Estonian champions===\n[[File:Kalev1.jpg|thumb|left|The 1923 Kalev team, who won the club's first league title]]\nIn the 1920s, the newly formed Estonian Football Championship was dominated by Tallinn sides Kalev, [[SK Tallinna Sport|Sport]] and [[Tallinna Jalgpalliklubi|TJK]]. The derby matches between the clubs drew thousands of spectators. Kalev won their first league title in [[1923 Estonian Football Championship|1923]]. The team included Estonian internationals such as [[Eduard Ellman-Eelma|Eduard Ellmann]], [[Ernst Joll]], [[Elmar Kaljot]], [[August Lass]] and [[Arnold Pihlak]], who went on to represent Estonia at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. On 16 August 1925, the team suffered a serious setback when the board of the association expelled eight key players from the squad over their decision to play in the opening match of TJK's new ground without the board's permission. The players subsequently joined TJK.<ref name=\"top10\">{{cite web|title=Top 10 - meistriliiga \u0161okeerivaimad juhtumid 1921-1940|publisher=Soccernet.ee|url=http://soccernet.ee/artikkel/top-10-meistriliiga-sokeerivaimad-juhtumid-1921-19401|language=Estonian|date=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Kalev1930.jpg|thumb|right|Kalev's championship-winning team in 1930]]\nTallinna Kalev won their second championship in the controversial [[1930 Estonian Football Championship|1930 season]]. Although never proven officially, the victory was widely accepted as a result of [[match fixing]]. To win the title, Kalev needed to win the final game of the season against the formidable [[KS V\u00f5itleja Narva|Narva V\u00f5itleja]] by eight goals and went on to win the match 11\u20130. V\u00f5itleja's performance was so poor that allegations of match fixing began instantly, with Kalev board member Aleksander M\u00e4ndvere being accused of bribing V\u00f5itleja players, particularly the team's goalkeeper Viruvere.<ref name=\"top10\"/>\n\nKalev reached the [[1939 Estonian Cup]] final, but lost to TJK 1\u20134.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Kalev in Soviet football===\n[[File:Kalev5.jpg|thumb|right|Kalev team in 1961]]\nFollowing [[World War II]] and the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia]], Kalev joined the [[Soviet Union football league system]], competing in the [[Soviet First League|second tier]] of Soviet football from 1947 to 1954, while Kalev's second team played in the Estonian championship. In [[1955 Estonian SSR Football Championship|1955]], Kalev's first team returned to the Estonian championship, winning their third league title. In 1960, Kalev joined [[Soviet Top League|Class A]], the top flight of Soviet football. The team finished their [[1960 Soviet Top League|first season]] in Class A in 19th place out of 22 teams. In the [[1961 Soviet Top League|1961 season]], Kalev finished last and were relegated to Class B.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Re-establishment===\n[[File:Kooseis 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Kalev team in 2017]]\nTallinna Kalev was re-established on 1 September 2002 and joined the [[Estonian football league system]]. The club won the Northern division of the [[III liiga]] in 2003. In 2004, [[Aavo Sarap]] was appointed as manager and Tallinna Kalev won the East/North division of the [[II liiga]]. The club finished the [[2006 Esiliiga]] in third place and were promoted to the [[Meistriliiga]], returning the top flight of Estonian football. Tallinna Kalev finished the [[2007 Meistriliiga|2007 season]] in sixth place. In August 2009, Sarap's contract was terminated and he was replaced by his assistant Daniel Meijel. The team finished the [[2009 Meistriliiga|2009 season]] in last place and were relegated.\n\nIn January 2010, [[Sergei Ratnikov]] was appointed as manager. Tallinna Kalev won the [[2011 Esiliiga]] were promoted back to the Meistriliiga. The club finished the [[2012 Meistriliiga|2012 season]] in ninth place, but avoided being relegated by defeating [[Rakvere JK Tarvas|Tarvas]] 3\u20131 on aggregate in the relegation play-offs. In December 2012, [[Frank Bernhardt]] was appointed as manager. Tallinna Kalev finished the [[2013 Meistriliiga|2013 season]] in eighth place. In January 2014, former Estonia national team manager [[Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli]] took over as manager. R\u00fc\u00fctli subsequently left in March 2014 and Sergei Zamogiln\u00f5i took over as manager. Following a disappointing [[2014 Meistriliiga|2014 season]], where Tallinna Kalev finished in 10th place and were relegated to the Esiliiga once again, Zamogiln\u00f5i was replaced by Marko P\u00e4rnpuu. Tallinna Kalev returned to the Meistriliiga after finishing the [[2017 Esiliiga|2017 season]] as runners-up. In November 2017, P\u00e4rnupuu was replaced by [[Argo Arbeiter]]. The team finished the [[2018 Meistriliiga|2018 season]] in eighth place, after which Arbeiter left and [[Aleksandr Dmitrijev]] took over as manager.\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:XIX \u00fcldtantsupidu, ettevalmistused 01.JPG|thumb|right|Kalev Keskstaadion]]\n{{main|Kalevi Keskstaadion}}\nThe club's home ground is the 11,500-seat Kalev Keskstaadion. Opened on 12 July 1955, the [[multi-purpose stadium]] was built near Kalev's old Tiigiveski Ground. Initially named Kalev Komsomol Stadium, the name was changed to Kalev Keskstaadion in 1989. It used to be the largest football stadium in Estonia until the completion of [[A. Le Coq Arena]] in 2001.

Underlying the spectroscopic technique is the [[Auger effect]], as it has come to be called, which is based on the analysis of energetic [[electron]]s emitted from an excited [[atom]] after a series of internal relaxation events. The Auger effect was discovered independently by both [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Pierre Victor Auger|Pierre Auger]] in the 1920s. Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal ''[[European Physical Journal|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.<ref name=\"grant2003\">{{cite book |last=Grant |first= John T.|year=2003 |title=Surface Analysis by Auger and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy |location=Chichester |publisher=IM Publications |isbn=1-901019-04-7 |author2=David Briggs}}</ref> Until the early 1950s Auger transitions were considered nuisance effects by spectroscopists, not containing much relevant material information, but studied so as to explain anomalies in [[X-ray spectroscopy]] data.

When an atom is probed by an external mechanism, such as a photon or a beam of electrons with energies in the range of several&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] to&nbsp;50 keV, a core state electron can be removed leaving behind a hole. As this is an unstable state, the core hole can be filled by an outer shell electron, whereby the electron moving to the lower energy level loses an amount of energy equal to the difference in orbital energies. The transition energy can be coupled to a second outer shell electron, which will be emitted from the atom if the transferred energy is greater than the orbital binding energy.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"thompson1985\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\">{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Leonard C. |author2=James W.

Figure 1 illustrates two schematic views of the Auger process.\n\n[[Image:Auger Process.svg|thumb|340px|'''Figure 1'''. Two views of the Auger process. (a) illustrates sequentially the steps involved in Auger deexcitation. An incident electron creates a core hole in the 1s level. An electron from the 2s level fills in the 1s hole and the transition energy is imparted to a 2p electron that is emitted. The final atomic state thus has two holes, one in the 2s orbital and the other in the 2p orbital. (b) illustrates the same process using [[X-ray notation]], <math>KL_1L_{2,3}</math>.]]\n\nThe types of state-to-state transitions available to electrons during an Auger event are dependent on several factors, ranging from initial excitation energy to relative interaction rates, yet are often dominated by a few characteristic transitions. Because of the interaction between an [[Electron magnetic moment|electron's spin]] and [[Angular momentum operator#Orbital angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] (spin-orbit coupling) and the concomitant energy level splitting for various shells in an atom, there are a variety of transition pathways for filling a core hole. Energy levels are labeled using a number of different schemes such as the j-j coupling method for heavy elements ([[Atomic number|''Z'']] \u2265 75), the Russell-Saunders L-S method for lighter elements (''Z'' < 20), and a combination of both for intermediate elements.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"kittel1996\">{{cite book |last=Kittel |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Kittel |year=1996 |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |edition= 7th |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=81-265-1045-5}}</ref><ref name=\"ashcroft_mermin\">{{cite book |last=Ashcroft |first=Neil |author2=Mermin, N.

Thus for a <math>KL_1L_{2,3}</math> transition, <math>K</math> represents the core level hole, <math>L_1</math> the relaxing electron's initial state, and <math>L_{2,3}</math> the emitted electron's initial energy state. Figure 1(b) illustrates this transition with the corresponding spectroscopic notation. The energy level of the core hole will often determine which transition types will be favored. For single energy levels, i.e. ''K'', transitions can occur from the L levels, giving rise to strong KLL type peaks in an Auger spectrum. Higher level transitions can also occur, but are less probable. For multi-level shells, transitions are available from higher energy orbitals (different ''n, \u2113'' quantum numbers) or energy levels within the same shell (same ''n'', different ''\u2113'' number).<ref name=\"carlson\"/> The result are transitions of the type LMM and KLL along with faster [[Coster\u2013Kronig transition]]s such as LLM.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> While Coster\u2013Kronig transitions are faster, they are also less energetic and thus harder to locate on an Auger spectrum. As the [[atomic number]] Z increases, so too does the number of potential Auger transitions. Fortunately, the strongest electron-electron interactions are between levels that are close together, giving rise to characteristic peaks in an Auger spectrum. KLL and LMM peaks are some of the most commonly identified transitions during surface analysis.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> Finally, valence band electrons can also fill core holes or be emitted during KVV-type transitions.\n\nSeveral models, both phenomenological and analytical, have been developed to describe the energetics of Auger transitions. One of the most tractable descriptions, put forth by Jenkins and Chung, estimates the energy of Auger transition ABC as:\n\n:<math>E_{ABC}=E_A(Z)-0.5[E_B(Z)+E_B(Z+1)]-0.5[E_C(Z)+E_C(Z+1)]</math>\n\n<math>E_i(Z)</math> are the binding energies of the <math>i</math>th level in element of atomic number ''Z'' and <math>E_i(Z+1)</math> are the energies of the same levels in the next element up in the periodic table. While useful in practice, a more rigorous model accounting for effects such as screening and relaxation probabilities between energy levels gives the Auger energy as:\n\n:<math>E_{ABC}=E_A-E_B-E_C-F(BC:x)+R_{xin}+R_{xex}</math>\n\nwhere <math>F(BC:x)</math> is the energy of interaction between the ''B'' and ''C'' level holes in a final atomic state ''x'' and the ''R'''s represent intra- and extra-atomic transition energies accounting for electronic screening.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> Auger electron energies can be calculated based on measured values of the various <math>E_i</math> and compared to peaks in the secondary electron spectrum in order to identify chemical species. This technique has been used to compile several reference databases used for analysis in current AES setups.\n\n==Experimental setup and quantification==\n\n===Instrumentation===\n\n[[Image:AES Setup2.JPG|thumb|340px|'''Figure 2'''. AES experimental setup using a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA). An electron beam is focused onto a specimen and emitted electrons are deflected around the electron gun and pass through an aperture towards the back of the CMA. These electrons are then directed into an electron multiplier for analysis. Varying voltage at the sweep supply allows derivative mode plotting of the Auger data. An optional ion gun can be integrated for depth profiling experiments.]]\n\nSurface sensitivity in AES arises from the fact that emitted electrons usually have energies ranging from 50&nbsp;eV to 3&nbsp;keV and at these values, electrons have a short [[mean free path]] in a solid. The escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to surface species.<ref name=\"oura2003\"/> Because of the low energy of Auger electrons, most AES setups are run under [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) conditions. Such measures prevent electron scattering off of residual gas atoms as well as the formation of a thin \"gas (adsorbate) layer\" on the surface of the specimen, which degrades analytical performance.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> A typical AES setup is shown schematically in figure 2. In this configuration, focused electrons are incident on a sample and emitted electrons are deflected into a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA). In the detection unit, Auger electrons are multiplied and the signal sent to data processing electronics. Collected Auger electrons are plotted as a function of energy against the broad secondary electron background spectrum.  The detection unit and data processing electronics  are collectively referred to as the electron energy analyzer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phi.com/surface-analysis-techniques/aes.html |title=Auger Electron Spectroscopy|publisher=Physical Electronics, Inc..(PHI)|date=2020 |website=Physical Electronics|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince the intensity of the Auger peaks may be small compared to the noise level of the background, AES is often run in a derivative mode that serves to highlight the peaks by modulating the electron collection current via a small applied AC voltage. Since this <math>\\Delta V=k\\sin(\\omega t)</math>, the collection current becomes <math>I(V+k\\sin(\\omega t))</math>. [[Taylor series|Taylor expanding]] <!--or is that [[Taylor's theorem]]? I cannot tell--> gives:\n\n:<math>I(V+k\\sin(\\omega t))\\approx I_0+I'(V+k\\sin(\\omega t))+O(I'')</math>\n\nUsing the setup in figure 2, detecting the signal at frequency \u03c9 will give a value for <math>I'</math> or <math>\\frac{dN}{dE}</math>.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> Plotting in derivative mode also emphasizes Auger fine structure, which appear as small secondary peaks surrounding the primary Auger peak. These secondary peaks, not to be confused with high energy satellites, which are discussed later, arise from the presence of the same element in multiple different chemical states on a surface (i.e. Adsorbate layers) or from relaxation transitions involving valence band electrons of the substrate. Figure 3 illustrates a derivative spectrum from a copper nitride film clearly showing the Auger peaks. The peak in derivative mode is not the true Auger peak, but rather the point of maximum slope of ''N(E)'', but this concern is usually ignored.<ref name=\"oura2003\"/>\n[[Image:Cu3NAES.JPG|thumb|340px|'''Figure 3'''. Auger spectrum of a copper nitride film in derivative mode plotted as a function of energy. Different peaks for Cu and N are apparent with the N KLL transition highlighted.]]\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n\nSemi-quantitative compositional and element analysis of a sample using AES is dependent on measuring the yield of Auger electrons during a probing event. Electron yield, in turn, depends on several critical parameters such as electron-impact cross-section and fluorescence yield.<ref name=\"thompson1985\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> Since the Auger effect is not the only mechanism available for atomic relaxation, there is a competition between radiative and non-radiative decay processes to be the primary de-excitation pathway. The total transition rate, \u03c9, is a sum of the non-radiative (Auger) and radiative (photon emission) processes. The Auger yield, <math>\\omega_A</math>, is thus related to the [[fluorescence]] (x-ray) yield, <math>\\omega_X</math>, by the relation,\n\n:<math>\\omega_A=1-\\omega_X=1-\\frac{W_X}{W_X+W_A}</math>\n\n[[File:Auger xray wiki in png format.png|thumb|340px|'''Figure 4'''. Fluorescence and Auger electron yields as a function of atomic number for K shell vacancies. Auger transitions (red curve) are more probable for lighter elements, while X-ray yield (dotted blue curve) becomes dominant at higher atomic numbers. Similar plots can be obtained for L and M shell transitions. Coster \u2013 Kronig (i.e. intra-shell) transitions are ignored in this analysis.]]\n\nwhere <math>W_X</math> is the X-ray transition probability and <math>W_A</math> is the Auger transition probability.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> Attempts to relate the fluorescence and Auger yields to atomic number have resulted in plots similar to figure 4. A clear transition from electron to photon emission is evident in this chart for increasing atomic number. For heavier elements, x-ray yield becomes greater than Auger yield, indicating an increased difficulty in measuring the Auger peaks for large Z-values. Conversely, AES is sensitive to the lighter elements, and unlike [[X-ray fluorescence]], Auger peaks can be detected for elements as light as [[lithium]] (''Z'' = 3). [[Lithium]] represents the lower limit for AES sensitivity since the Auger effect is a \"three state\" event necessitating at least three electrons. Neither [[hydrogen|H]] nor [[Helium|He]] can be detected with this technique. For K-level based transitions, Auger effects are dominant for ''Z'' < 15 while for L- and M-level transitions, AES data can be measured for ''Z'' \u2264 50.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> The yield limits effectively prescribe a cutoff for AES sensitivity, but complex techniques can be utilized to identify heavier elements, such as [[uranium]] and [[americium]], using the Auger effect.<ref name=\"grant2003\"/>\n\nAnother critical quantity that determines yield of Auger electrons at a detector is the electron impact cross-section. Early approximations (in cm<sup>2</sup>) of the cross-section were based on the work of Worthington and Tomlin,\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{ax}(E)=1.3\\times10^{13}b\\frac{C}{E_p}</math>\n\nwith ''b'' acting as a scaling factor between 0.25 and 0.35, and ''C'' a function of the primary electron beam energy, <math>E_p</math>. While this value of <math>\\sigma_{ax}</math> is calculated for an isolated atom, a simple modification can be made to account for matrix effects:\n\n:<math>\\sigma (E)=\\sigma_{ax}[1+r_m(E_p,\\alpha)]</math>\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the angle to the surface normal of the incident electron beam; ''r<sub>m</sub>'' can be established empirically and encompasses electron interactions with the matrix such as ionization due to backscattered electrons. Thus the total yield can be written as:\n:<math>Y(t)=N_x \\times \\delta t \\times \\sigma (E,t )[1-\\omega_X] \\exp\\left(-t\\cos \\frac{\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right) \\times I(t)\\times T\\times\\frac{d(\\Omega)}{4\\pi}</math>\n\nHere ''N<sub>x</sub>'' is the number of ''x'' atoms per volume, \u03bb the electron escape depth, \u03b8 the analyzer angle, ''T'' the transmission of the analyzer, ''I(t)'' the electron excitation flux at depth ''t'', d\u03a9 the solid angle, and \u03b4t is the thickness of the layer being probed. Encompassed in these terms, especially the Auger yield, which is related to the transition probability, is the quantum mechanical overlap of the initial and final state [[wave function]]s. Precise expressions for the transition probability, based on first-order perturbation [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, can be found in Thompson and Baker.<ref name=\"thompson1985\"/> Often, all of these terms are not known, so most analyses compare measured yields with external standards of known composition. Ratios of the acquired data to standards can eliminate common terms, especially experimental setup characteristics and material parameters, and can be used to determine element composition.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> Comparison techniques work best for samples of homogeneous binary materials or uniform surface layers, while elemental identification is best obtained from comparison of pure samples.\n\n==Uses==\n\nThere are a number of electron microscopes that have been specifically designed for use in Auger spectroscopy; these are termed [[scanning Auger microscope]]s (SAMs) and can produce high resolution, spatially resolved chemical images.<ref name=\"grant2003\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Attard |first1=Gary |last2=Barnes |first2=Colin |date= |title=Surfaces |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford Chemistry Primers |page=47 |isbn=978-0-19-855686-2 |author-link= }}</ref> SAM images are obtained by stepping a focused electron beam across a sample surface and measuring the intensity of the Auger peak above the background of scattered electrons. The intensity map is correlated to a gray scale on a monitor with whiter areas corresponding to higher element concentration. In addition, [[sputtering]] is sometimes used with Auger spectroscopy to perform depth profiling experiments. Sputtering removes thin outer layers of a surface so that AES can be used to determine the underlying composition.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"thompson1985\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> Depth profiles are shown as either Auger peak height vs. sputter time or atomic concentration vs. depth. Precise depth milling through sputtering has made profiling an invaluable technique for chemical analysis of nanostructured materials and thin films. AES is also used extensively as an evaluation tool on and off fab lines in the microelectronics industry, while the versatility and sensitivity of the Auger process makes it a standard analytical tool in research labs.<ref name=\"chao_yang\">{{cite journal |last=Chao |first=Liang-Chiun |author2=Shih-Hsuan Yang |date=June 2007 |title=Growth and Auger electron spectroscopy characterization of donut-shaped ZnO nanostructures |journal=Applied Surface Science |volume=253 |issue=17 |pages=7162\u20137165 |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.02.184|bibcode = 2007ApSS..253.7162C }}</ref><ref name=\"jang2007\">{{cite journal |author=Soohwan Jang |date=May 2007 |title=Comparison of E-beam and Sputter-Deposited ITO Films for 1.55 \u03bcm Metal\u2013Semiconductor\u2013Metal Photodetector Applications |journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society |volume=154 |issue=5 |pages=H336\u2013H339 |doi=10.1149/1.2667428 |display-authors=1 |last2=Kang |first2=B.

When a molecule is protonated or deprotonated, the geometry and electronic structure is changed, and AES spectra reflect this. In general, as a molecule becomes more protonated, the ionization potentials increase and the kinetic energy of the emitted outer shell electrons decreases.<ref>Kryzhevoi, Nikolai V., and Lorenz S. Cederbaum. \"Exploring Protonation and Deprotonation Effects with Auger Electron Spectroscopy.\" The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. 3.18 (2012): 2733-737.</ref>\n\nDespite the advantages of high spatial resolution and precise chemical sensitivity attributed to AES, there are several factors that can limit the applicability of this technique, especially when evaluating solid specimens. One of the most common limitations encountered with Auger spectroscopy are charging effects in non-conducting samples.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> Charging results when the number of secondary electrons leaving the sample is different from the number of incident electrons, giving rise to a net positive or negative electric charge at the surface. Both positive and negative surface charges severely alter the yield of electrons emitted from the sample and hence distort the measured Auger peaks. To complicate matters, neutralization methods employed in other surface analysis techniques, such as [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS), are not applicable to AES, as these methods usually involve surface bombardment with either electrons or [[ions]] (i.e. [[flood gun]]). Several processes have been developed to combat the issue of charging, though none of them is ideal and still make quantification of AES data difficult.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> One such technique involves depositing conductive pads near the analysis area to minimize regional charging. However, this type of approach limits SAM applications as well as the amount of sample material available for probing. A related technique involves thinning or \"dimpling\" a non-conductive layer with [[argon|Ar<sup>+</sup>]] ions and then mounting the sample to a conductive backing prior to AES.<ref name=\"yu_jin\">{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=Ling |author2=Deling Jin |date=April 2001 |title=AES and SAM microanalysis of structure ceramics by thinning and coating the backside |journal=[[Surface and Interface Analysis]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=338\u2013342 |doi=10.1002/sia.982}}</ref><ref name=\"cazaux1992\">{{cite journal |last=Cazaux |first=Jacques |date=December 1992 |title=Mechanisms of charging in electron spectroscopy |journal=Journal of Electronic Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena |volume=105 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=155\u2013185 |doi=10.1016/S0368-2048(99)00068-7}}</ref> This method has been debated, with claims that the thinning process leaves elemental artifacts on a surface and/or creates damaged layers that distort bonding and promote chemical mixing in the sample. As a result, the compositional AES data is considered suspect. The most common setup to minimize charging effects includes use of a glancing angle (~10\u00b0) electron beam and a carefully tuned bombarding energy (between 1.5 keV and 3 keV). Control of both the angle and energy can subtly alter the number of emitted electrons vis-\u00e0-vis the incident electrons and thereby reduce or altogether eliminate sample charging.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/>\n\nIn addition to charging effects, AES data can be obscured by the presence of characteristic energy losses in a sample and higher order atomic ionization events. Electrons ejected from a solid will generally undergo multiple scattering events and lose energy in the form of collective electron density oscillations called [[plasmon]]s.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> If plasmon losses have energies near that of an Auger peak, the less intense Auger process may become dwarfed by the plasmon peak. As Auger spectra are normally weak and spread over many eV of energy, they are difficult to extract from the background and in the presence of plasmon losses; deconvolution of the two peaks becomes extremely difficult. For such spectra, additional analysis through chemical sensitive surface techniques like [[x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS) is often required to disentangle the peaks.<ref name=\"carlson\"/> Sometimes an Auger spectrum can also exhibit \"satellite\" peaks at well-defined off-set energies from the parent peak. Origin of the satellites is usually attributed to multiple ionization events in an atom or ionization cascades in which a series of electrons is emitted as relaxation occurs for core holes of multiple levels.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> The presence of satellites can distort the true Auger peak and/or small peak shift information due to chemical bonding at the surface. Several studies have been undertaken to further quantify satellite peaks.<ref name=\"went2006\">{{cite journal |last=Went |first=M. R. |author2=M. Vos |author3=A. S.

When an atom is probed by an external mechanism, such as a photon or a beam of electrons with energies in the range of several&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] to&nbsp;50 keV, a core state electron can be removed leaving behind a hole. As this is an unstable state, the core hole can be filled by an outer shell electron, whereby the electron moving to the lower energy level loses an amount of energy equal to the difference in orbital energies. The transition energy can be coupled to a second outer shell electron, which will be emitted from the atom if the transferred energy is greater than the orbital binding energy.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"thompson1985\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\">{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Leonard C. |author2=James W.

Figure 1 illustrates two schematic views of the Auger process.\n\n[[Image:Auger Process.svg|thumb|340px|'''Figure 1'''. Two views of the Auger process. (a) illustrates sequentially the steps involved in Auger deexcitation. An incident electron creates a core hole in the 1s level. An electron from the 2s level fills in the 1s hole and the transition energy is imparted to a 2p electron that is emitted. The final atomic state thus has two holes, one in the 2s orbital and the other in the 2p orbital. (b) illustrates the same process using [[X-ray notation]], <math>KL_1L_{2,3}</math>.]]\n\nThe types of state-to-state transitions available to electrons during an Auger event are dependent on several factors, ranging from initial excitation energy to relative interaction rates, yet are often dominated by a few characteristic transitions. Because of the interaction between an [[Electron magnetic moment|electron's spin]] and [[Angular momentum operator#Orbital angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] (spin-orbit coupling) and the concomitant energy level splitting for various shells in an atom, there are a variety of transition pathways for filling a core hole. Energy levels are labeled using a number of different schemes such as the j-j coupling method for heavy elements ([[Atomic number|''Z'']] \u2265 75), the Russell-Saunders L-S method for lighter elements (''Z'' < 20), and a combination of both for intermediate elements.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"kittel1996\">{{cite book |last=Kittel |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Kittel |year=1996 |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |edition= 7th |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=81-265-1045-5}}</ref><ref name=\"ashcroft_mermin\">{{cite book |last=Ashcroft |first=Neil |author2=Mermin, N.

Thus for a <math>KL_1L_{2,3}</math> transition, <math>K</math> represents the core level hole, <math>L_1</math> the relaxing electron's initial state, and <math>L_{2,3}</math> the emitted electron's initial energy state. Figure 1(b) illustrates this transition with the corresponding spectroscopic notation. The energy level of the core hole will often determine which transition types will be favored. For single energy levels, i.e. ''K'', transitions can occur from the L levels, giving rise to strong KLL type peaks in an Auger spectrum. Higher level transitions can also occur, but are less probable. For multi-level shells, transitions are available from higher energy orbitals (different ''n, \u2113'' quantum numbers) or energy levels within the same shell (same ''n'', different ''\u2113'' number).<ref name=\"carlson\"/> The result are transitions of the type LMM and KLL along with faster [[Coster\u2013Kronig transition]]s such as LLM.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> While Coster\u2013Kronig transitions are faster, they are also less energetic and thus harder to locate on an Auger spectrum. As the [[atomic number]] Z increases, so too does the number of potential Auger transitions. Fortunately, the strongest electron-electron interactions are between levels that are close together, giving rise to characteristic peaks in an Auger spectrum. KLL and LMM peaks are some of the most commonly identified transitions during surface analysis.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> Finally, valence band electrons can also fill core holes or be emitted during KVV-type transitions.\n\nSeveral models, both phenomenological and analytical, have been developed to describe the energetics of Auger transitions. One of the most tractable descriptions, put forth by Jenkins and Chung, estimates the energy of Auger transition ABC as:\n\n:<math>E_{ABC}=E_A(Z)-0.5[E_B(Z)+E_B(Z+1)]-0.5[E_C(Z)+E_C(Z+1)]</math>\n\n<math>E_i(Z)</math> are the binding energies of the <math>i</math>th level in element of atomic number ''Z'' and <math>E_i(Z+1)</math> are the energies of the same levels in the next element up in the periodic table. While useful in practice, a more rigorous model accounting for effects such as screening and relaxation probabilities between energy levels gives the Auger energy as:\n\n:<math>E_{ABC}=E_A-E_B-E_C-F(BC:x)+R_{xin}+R_{xex}</math>\n\nwhere <math>F(BC:x)</math> is the energy of interaction between the ''B'' and ''C'' level holes in a final atomic state ''x'' and the ''R'''s represent intra- and extra-atomic transition energies accounting for electronic screening.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> Auger electron energies can be calculated based on measured values of the various <math>E_i</math> and compared to peaks in the secondary electron spectrum in order to identify chemical species. This technique has been used to compile several reference databases used for analysis in current AES setups.\n\n==Experimental setup and quantification==\n\n===Instrumentation===\n\n[[Image:AES Setup2.JPG|thumb|340px|'''Figure 2'''. AES experimental setup using a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA). An electron beam is focused onto a specimen and emitted electrons are deflected around the electron gun and pass through an aperture towards the back of the CMA. These electrons are then directed into an electron multiplier for analysis. Varying voltage at the sweep supply allows derivative mode plotting of the Auger data. An optional ion gun can be integrated for depth profiling experiments.]]\n\nSurface sensitivity in AES arises from the fact that emitted electrons usually have energies ranging from 50&nbsp;eV to 3&nbsp;keV and at these values, electrons have a short [[mean free path]] in a solid. The escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to surface species.<ref name=\"oura2003\"/> Because of the low energy of Auger electrons, most AES setups are run under [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) conditions. Such measures prevent electron scattering off of residual gas atoms as well as the formation of a thin \"gas (adsorbate) layer\" on the surface of the specimen, which degrades analytical performance.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> A typical AES setup is shown schematically in figure 2. In this configuration, focused electrons are incident on a sample and emitted electrons are deflected into a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA). In the detection unit, Auger electrons are multiplied and the signal sent to data processing electronics. Collected Auger electrons are plotted as a function of energy against the broad secondary electron background spectrum.  The detection unit and data processing electronics  are collectively referred to as the electron energy analyzer<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phi.com/surface-analysis-techniques/aes.html |title=Auger Electron Spectroscopy|publisher=Physical Electronics, Inc..(PHI)|date=2020 |website=Physical Electronics|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref>.\n\nSince the intensity of the Auger peaks may be small compared to the noise level of the background, AES is often run in a derivative mode that serves to highlight the peaks by modulating the electron collection current via a small applied AC voltage. Since this <math>\\Delta V=k\\sin(\\omega t)</math>, the collection current becomes <math>I(V+k\\sin(\\omega t))</math>. [[Taylor series|Taylor expanding]] <!--or is that [[Taylor's theorem]]? I cannot tell--> gives:\n\n:<math>I(V+k\\sin(\\omega t))\\approx I_0+I'(V+k\\sin(\\omega t))+O(I'')</math>\n\nUsing the setup in figure 2, detecting the signal at frequency \u03c9 will give a value for <math>I'</math> or <math>\\frac{dN}{dE}</math>.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> Plotting in derivative mode also emphasizes Auger fine structure, which appear as small secondary peaks surrounding the primary Auger peak. These secondary peaks, not to be confused with high energy satellites, which are discussed later, arise from the presence of the same element in multiple different chemical states on a surface (i.e. Adsorbate layers) or from relaxation transitions involving valence band electrons of the substrate. Figure 3 illustrates a derivative spectrum from a copper nitride film clearly showing the Auger peaks. The peak in derivative mode is not the true Auger peak, but rather the point of maximum slope of ''N(E)'', but this concern is usually ignored.<ref name=\"oura2003\"/>\n[[Image:Cu3NAES.JPG|thumb|340px|'''Figure 3'''. Auger spectrum of a copper nitride film in derivative mode plotted as a function of energy. Different peaks for Cu and N are apparent with the N KLL transition highlighted.]]\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n\nSemi-quantitative compositional and element analysis of a sample using AES is dependent on measuring the yield of Auger electrons during a probing event. Electron yield, in turn, depends on several critical parameters such as electron-impact cross-section and fluorescence yield.<ref name=\"thompson1985\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> Since the Auger effect is not the only mechanism available for atomic relaxation, there is a competition between radiative and non-radiative decay processes to be the primary de-excitation pathway. The total transition rate, \u03c9, is a sum of the non-radiative (Auger) and radiative (photon emission) processes. The Auger yield, <math>\\omega_A</math>, is thus related to the [[fluorescence]] (x-ray) yield, <math>\\omega_X</math>, by the relation,\n\n:<math>\\omega_A=1-\\omega_X=1-\\frac{W_X}{W_X+W_A}</math>\n\n[[File:Auger xray wiki in png format.png|thumb|340px|'''Figure 4'''. Fluorescence and Auger electron yields as a function of atomic number for K shell vacancies. Auger transitions (red curve) are more probable for lighter elements, while X-ray yield (dotted blue curve) becomes dominant at higher atomic numbers. Similar plots can be obtained for L and M shell transitions. Coster \u2013 Kronig (i.e. intra-shell) transitions are ignored in this analysis.]]\n\nwhere <math>W_X</math> is the X-ray transition probability and <math>W_A</math> is the Auger transition probability.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> Attempts to relate the fluorescence and Auger yields to atomic number have resulted in plots similar to figure 4. A clear transition from electron to photon emission is evident in this chart for increasing atomic number. For heavier elements, x-ray yield becomes greater than Auger yield, indicating an increased difficulty in measuring the Auger peaks for large Z-values. Conversely, AES is sensitive to the lighter elements, and unlike [[X-ray fluorescence]], Auger peaks can be detected for elements as light as [[lithium]] (''Z'' = 3). [[Lithium]] represents the lower limit for AES sensitivity since the Auger effect is a \"three state\" event necessitating at least three electrons. Neither [[hydrogen|H]] nor [[Helium|He]] can be detected with this technique. For K-level based transitions, Auger effects are dominant for ''Z'' < 15 while for L- and M-level transitions, AES data can be measured for ''Z'' \u2264 50.<ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> The yield limits effectively prescribe a cutoff for AES sensitivity, but complex techniques can be utilized to identify heavier elements, such as [[uranium]] and [[americium]], using the Auger effect.<ref name=\"grant2003\"/>\n\nAnother critical quantity that determines yield of Auger electrons at a detector is the electron impact cross-section. Early approximations (in cm<sup>2</sup>) of the cross-section were based on the work of Worthington and Tomlin,\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{ax}(E)=1.3\\times10^{13}b\\frac{C}{E_p}</math>\n\nwith ''b'' acting as a scaling factor between 0.25 and 0.35, and ''C'' a function of the primary electron beam energy, <math>E_p</math>. While this value of <math>\\sigma_{ax}</math> is calculated for an isolated atom, a simple modification can be made to account for matrix effects:\n\n:<math>\\sigma (E)=\\sigma_{ax}[1+r_m(E_p,\\alpha)]</math>\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the angle to the surface normal of the incident electron beam; ''r<sub>m</sub>'' can be established empirically and encompasses electron interactions with the matrix such as ionization due to backscattered electrons. Thus the total yield can be written as:\n:<math>Y(t)=N_x \\times \\delta t \\times \\sigma (E,t )[1-\\omega_X] \\exp\\left(-t\\cos \\frac{\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right) \\times I(t)\\times T\\times\\frac{d(\\Omega)}{4\\pi}</math>\n\nHere ''N<sub>x</sub>'' is the number of ''x'' atoms per volume, \u03bb the electron escape depth, \u03b8 the analyzer angle, ''T'' the transmission of the analyzer, ''I(t)'' the electron excitation flux at depth ''t'', d\u03a9 the solid angle, and \u03b4t is the thickness of the layer being probed. Encompassed in these terms, especially the Auger yield, which is related to the transition probability, is the quantum mechanical overlap of the initial and final state [[wave function]]s. Precise expressions for the transition probability, based on first-order perturbation [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, can be found in Thompson and Baker.<ref name=\"thompson1985\"/> Often, all of these terms are not known, so most analyses compare measured yields with external standards of known composition. Ratios of the acquired data to standards can eliminate common terms, especially experimental setup characteristics and material parameters, and can be used to determine element composition.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> Comparison techniques work best for samples of homogeneous binary materials or uniform surface layers, while elemental identification is best obtained from comparison of pure samples.\n\n==Uses==\n\nThere are a number of electron microscopes that have been specifically designed for use in Auger spectroscopy; these are termed [[scanning Auger microscope]]s (SAMs) and can produce high resolution, spatially resolved chemical images.<ref name=\"grant2003\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Attard |first1=Gary |last2=Barnes |first2=Colin |date= |title=Surfaces |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford Chemistry Primers |page=47 |isbn=978-0-19-855686-2 |author-link= }}</ref> SAM images are obtained by stepping a focused electron beam across a sample surface and measuring the intensity of the Auger peak above the background of scattered electrons. The intensity map is correlated to a gray scale on a monitor with whiter areas corresponding to higher element concentration. In addition, [[sputtering]] is sometimes used with Auger spectroscopy to perform depth profiling experiments. Sputtering removes thin outer layers of a surface so that AES can be used to determine the underlying composition.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"thompson1985\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> Depth profiles are shown as either Auger peak height vs. sputter time or atomic concentration vs. depth. Precise depth milling through sputtering has made profiling an invaluable technique for chemical analysis of nanostructured materials and thin films. AES is also used extensively as an evaluation tool on and off fab lines in the microelectronics industry, while the versatility and sensitivity of the Auger process makes it a standard analytical tool in research labs.<ref name=\"chao_yang\">{{cite journal |last=Chao |first=Liang-Chiun |author2=Shih-Hsuan Yang |date=June 2007 |title=Growth and Auger electron spectroscopy characterization of donut-shaped ZnO nanostructures |journal=Applied Surface Science |volume=253 |issue=17 |pages=7162\u20137165 |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.02.184|bibcode = 2007ApSS..253.7162C }}</ref><ref name=\"jang2007\">{{cite journal |author=Soohwan Jang |date=May 2007 |title=Comparison of E-beam and Sputter-Deposited ITO Films for 1.55 \u03bcm Metal\u2013Semiconductor\u2013Metal Photodetector Applications |journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society |volume=154 |issue=5 |pages=H336\u2013H339 |doi=10.1149/1.2667428 |display-authors=1 |last2=Kang |first2=B.

When a molecule is protonated or deprotonated, the geometry and electronic structure is changed, and AES spectra reflect this.

Cederbaum. \"Exploring Protonation and Deprotonation Effects with Auger Electron Spectroscopy.\" The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. 3.18 (2012): 2733-737.</ref>\n\nDespite the advantages of high spatial resolution and precise chemical sensitivity attributed to AES, there are several factors that can limit the applicability of this technique, especially when evaluating solid specimens. One of the most common limitations encountered with Auger spectroscopy are charging effects in non-conducting samples.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> Charging results when the number of secondary electrons leaving the sample is different from the number of incident electrons, giving rise to a net positive or negative electric charge at the surface. Both positive and negative surface charges severely alter the yield of electrons emitted from the sample and hence distort the measured Auger peaks. To complicate matters, neutralization methods employed in other surface analysis techniques, such as [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS), are not applicable to AES, as these methods usually involve surface bombardment with either electrons or [[ions]] (i.e. [[flood gun]]). Several processes have been developed to combat the issue of charging, though none of them is ideal and still make quantification of AES data difficult.<ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/> One such technique involves depositing conductive pads near the analysis area to minimize regional charging. However, this type of approach limits SAM applications as well as the amount of sample material available for probing. A related technique involves thinning or \"dimpling\" a non-conductive layer with [[argon|Ar<sup>+</sup>]] ions and then mounting the sample to a conductive backing prior to AES.<ref name=\"yu_jin\">{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=Ling |author2=Deling Jin |date=April 2001 |title=AES and SAM microanalysis of structure ceramics by thinning and coating the backside |journal=[[Surface and Interface Analysis]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=338\u2013342 |doi=10.1002/sia.982}}</ref><ref name=\"cazaux1992\">{{cite journal |last=Cazaux |first=Jacques |date=December 1992 |title=Mechanisms of charging in electron spectroscopy |journal=Journal of Electronic Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena |volume=105 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=155\u2013185 |doi=10.1016/S0368-2048(99)00068-7}}</ref> This method has been debated, with claims that the thinning process leaves elemental artifacts on a surface and/or creates damaged layers that distort bonding and promote chemical mixing in the sample. As a result, the compositional AES data is considered suspect. The most common setup to minimize charging effects includes use of a glancing angle (~10\u00b0) electron beam and a carefully tuned bombarding energy (between 1.5 keV and 3 keV). Control of both the angle and energy can subtly alter the number of emitted electrons vis-\u00e0-vis the incident electrons and thereby reduce or altogether eliminate sample charging.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"davis1980\"/><ref name=\"feldman_mayer\"/>\n\nIn addition to charging effects, AES data can be obscured by the presence of characteristic energy losses in a sample and higher order atomic ionization events. Electrons ejected from a solid will generally undergo multiple scattering events and lose energy in the form of collective electron density oscillations called [[plasmon]]s.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"oura2003\"/> If plasmon losses have energies near that of an Auger peak, the less intense Auger process may become dwarfed by the plasmon peak. As Auger spectra are normally weak and spread over many eV of energy, they are difficult to extract from the background and in the presence of plasmon losses; deconvolution of the two peaks becomes extremely difficult. For such spectra, additional analysis through chemical sensitive surface techniques like [[x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS) is often required to disentangle the peaks.<ref name=\"carlson\"/> Sometimes an Auger spectrum can also exhibit \"satellite\" peaks at well-defined off-set energies from the parent peak. Origin of the satellites is usually attributed to multiple ionization events in an atom or ionization cascades in which a series of electrons is emitted as relaxation occurs for core holes of multiple levels.<ref name=\"carlson\"/><ref name=\"briggs_sheah1983\"/> The presence of satellites can distort the true Auger peak and/or small peak shift information due to chemical bonding at the surface. Several studies have been undertaken to further quantify satellite peaks.<ref name=\"went2006\">{{cite journal |last=Went |first=M. R. |author2=M. Vos |author3=A. S.

Since 1996, the nominees have been announced in February, and the winners announced at a gala banquet held in May, usually during the [[BookExpo America]] fair. The Audies are sometimes promoted as \"the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] of the audiobook industry\" and serve as a way to promote audiobooks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/features/A2079_Audies08.pdf |title=The Audies Finalists 2008 |work=[[AudioFile (magazine)|AudioFile]] |author= |date=2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578637850049098298 |title=The New Explosion in Audio Books |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |author=Alexandra Alter |date=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAwards are given in about thirty categories. Some of the awards relate to types of writing, including abridged and unabridged fiction and non-fiction, and such [[genre]]s as [[romance novels|romance]], [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[mystery novels|mystery]]; other awards recognize excellence in different styles of narration and production, such as multi-voiced performance and production values.

The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod [[electrode]] projects through the stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an [[electrostatic generator]], or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]]. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm| title=How Capacitors Work| date=2007-09-17| access-date=2014-02-15| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103184652/https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm| archive-date=2018-01-03| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe original form of the device is just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it.

In the 1700s American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the [[dielectric]].  The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin.<ref>Letter IV: Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749 (Bigelow vol II p. 237-253) [http://www.compadre.org/precollege/items/Load.cfm?ID=3430 (PDF containing extracts)]</ref>  Franklin designed a \"dissectible\" Leyden jar ''(right)'', which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar.

By the middle of the 19th century, the Leyden jar had become common enough for writers to assume their readers knew of and understood its basic operation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Around the turn of the century it began to be widely used in [[spark-gap transmitter]]s and medical [[electrotherapy]] equipment. By the early 20th century, improved dielectrics and the need to reduce their size and undesired [[inductance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for use in the new technology of [[radio]] caused the Leyden jar to evolve into the modern compact form of [[capacitor]].\n\n== Design ==\n[[Image:Leyden jar showing construction.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Leyden jar construction.]]\nA typical design consists of a [[glass]] jar with conducting tin foil coating the inner and outer surfaces. The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod [[electrode]] projects through the stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an [[electrostatic generator]], or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]]. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm| title=How Capacitors Work| date=2007-09-17| access-date=2014-02-15| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103184652/https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm| archive-date=2018-01-03| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe original form of the device is just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it. The role of the outer plate is provided by the hand of the experimenter.

In the 1700s American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the [[dielectric]].  The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin.<ref>Letter IV: Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749 (Bigelow vol II p. 237-253) [http://www.compadre.org/precollege/items/Load.cfm?ID=3430 (PDF containing extracts)]</ref>  Franklin designed a \"dissectible\" Leyden jar ''(right)'', which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar. If the pieces are re-assembled, a large [[electric spark|spark]] may still be obtained from it.\n\nThis demonstration appears to suggest that [[capacitor]]s store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar.<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Allan | title = Part 6: The Leyden jar and other capacitors | journal = Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society | issue = 99 | pages = 20\u201322 | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | accessdate = 2010-06-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024546/http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 }}</ref> In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred to the surface of the glass cup by [[corona discharge]] when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all the surface charge. [[Soda glass]] is [[hygroscopic]] and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge.<ref name=\"Mills\" /> Addenbrooke (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Addenbrooke | first = G.

In order to produce energy, they use an anaerobic process called methanogenesis. This process is used in lieu of aerobic, or with oxygen, processes because methanogens are unable to metabolise in the presence of even small concentrations of oxygen. When acetate is broken down in methanogenesis, the result is the release of methane into the surrounding environment.\n\n''[[Methanogenesis]]'', the scientific term for methane production, occurs primarily in anaerobic conditions because of the lack of availability of other oxidants. In these conditions, [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] organisms called [[archaea]] use acetate and hydrogen to break down essential resources{{vague|date=February 2016}} in a process called [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].\n\n''Acetoclastic methanogenesis'' \u2013 certain archaea cleave [[acetate]] produced during anaerobic fermentation to yield methane and carbon dioxide.\n\n:H<sub>3</sub>C-COOH \u2192 CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\n''Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis'' \u2013 archaea [[oxidize]] hydrogen with carbon dioxide to yield methane and water.\n\n:4H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nWhile acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are the two major source reactions for atmospheric methane, other minor biological methane source reactions also occur. For example, it has been discovered that [[Epicuticular wax|leaf surface wax]] exposed to [[UV radiation]] in the presence of oxygen is an aerobic source of methane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Leaf surface wax is a source of plant methane formation under UV radiation and in the presence of oxygen |display-authors=1 |last1=Bruhn |first1=D. |last2=Mikkelsen |first2=T.

The level of the water table represents the boundary between anaerobic methane production and aerobic methane consumption.

Methane transport by vascular plants can bypass this aerobic layer, thus increasing emission.<ref name=Macdonald1998>{{cite journal |title=Methane emission rates from a northern wetland; response to temperature, water table and transport |last1=Macdonald |first1=J.

Some of these microorganisms use the acetate from the plant material to produce methane, and because these bacteria live in the stomachs and intestines of ruminants, whenever the animal \"burps\" or defecates, it emits methane as well. Based upon a study in the [[Snowy Mountains]] region, the amount of methane emitted by one cow is equivalent to the amount of methane that around 3.4 hectares of [[#Removal processes|methanotrophic bacteria]] can consume.<ref name=MasonJones2012>Per this source:<br/> :{{cite book |title=Should Meat be on the Menu? |first1=David |last1=Mason-Jones |year=2012 |publisher=Momentum |isbn=978-1743340608 |page=103 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2Lkp8jmFsFEC|page=103}} }}<br/> research in the Snowy Mountains region of Australia showed 8 tonnes of methane oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria per year on a 1,000 hectare farm. 200 cows on the same farm emitted 5.4 tonnes of methane per year.

However, some of these microorganisms are so unique that they live nowhere else in the world except in the third gut of termites.

This occurs with two different types of bacteria. \"High capacity-low affinity\" methanotrophic bacteria grow in areas of high methane concentration, such as waterlogged soils in wetlands and other moist environments. And in areas of low methane concentration, \"low capacity-high affinity\" methanotrophic bacteria make use of the methane in the atmosphere to grow, rather than relying on methane in their immediate environment.<ref name=\"SoilSink\"/>\n\nForest soils act as good sinks for atmospheric methane because soils are optimally moist for methanotroph activity, and the movement of gases between soil and atmosphere (soil diffusivity) is high.<ref name=\"SoilSink\"/> With a lower water table, any methane in the soil has to make it past the methanotrophic bacteria before it can reach the atmosphere.\n\nWetland soils, however, are often sources of atmospheric methane rather than sinks because the water table is much higher, and the methane can be diffused fairly easily into the air without having to compete with the soil's methanotrophs.\n\n''[[Methanotrophic]] bacteria in soils'' \u2013 Methanotrophic bacteria that reside within soil use methane as a source of carbon in methane oxidation.<ref name=\"SoilSink\">{{cite web |first1=Dave |last1=Reay |title=Methane Sinks \u2212 Soils |work=Greenhouse Gas Online |url=http://www.ghgonline.org/methanesinksoil.htm |accessdate=2016-12-22}}</ref> Methane oxidation allows methanotrophic bacteria to use methane as a source of energy, reacting methane with oxygen and as a result producing carbon dioxide and water.\n\n: CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n====Troposphere====\nThe most effective sink of atmospheric methane is the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere, or the lowest portion of Earth's atmosphere.

However, growth rates quickly fell due to lower temperatures and global reduction in rainfall.\n\nThe cause of the 1998 spike is unresolved, but scientists are currently attributing it to a combination of increased wetland and rice field emissions as well as an increased amount of biomass burning. 1998 was also the warmest year since surface temperatures were first recorded, suggesting that anomalously high temperatures can induce elevated methane emission.<ref name=\"IPCC7\">{{cite web |author=Denman, K.L. |title=7.

For both natural and anthropogenic sources, higher temperatures and higher water levels result in the anaerobic environment that is necessary for methane production.\n\n===Natural methane cycles===\nEmissions of methane into the atmosphere are directly related to temperature and moisture. Thus, the natural environmental changes that occur during seasonal change act as a major control of methane emission. Additionally, even changes in temperature during the day can affect the amount of methane that is produced and consumed.\n\nFor example, plants that produce methane can emit as much as two to four times more methane during the day than during the night.<ref name=\"Bubier\"/> This is directly related to the fact that plants tend to rely on solar energy to enact chemical processes.\n\nAdditionally, methane emissions are affected by the level of water sources. Seasonal flooding during the spring and summer naturally increases the amount of methane released into the air.\n\n==Changes due to human activity==\n\n===Changes due to pre-industrial human activity===\n\nThe most clearly identified rise in atmospheric methane as a result of human activity occurred in the 1700s during the industrial revolution. As technology increased at a considerable rate, humans began to build factories and plants, burn fossil fuels for energy, and clear out forests and other vegetation for the purpose of building and agriculture. This growth continued to rise at a rate of almost 1 percent per year until around 1990 when growth rates dropped to almost zero.<ref name=\"IPPC2\"/>\n\nA 2003 article from William F. Ruddiman, however, indicates that the anthropogenic change in methane may have started 5000 years prior to the industrial revolution.<ref name=\"Ruddiman\"/> The methane [[insolation]] cycles of the ice core remained stable and predictable until 5000 years ago, most likely due to some anthropogenic effect.<ref name=\"Ruddiman\"/> Ruddiman suggests that the transition of humans from hunter gatherers into agricultural farming was the first instance of humans affecting methane concentration in the atmosphere. Ruddiman's hypothesis is supported by the fact that early rice irrigation occurred approximately 5000 years ago\u2014the same time the ice core cycles lost their predictability. Due to the inefficiency of humans first learning how to grow rice, extensive rice paddies would have been needed to feed even a small population. These, over-flooded and filled with weeds, would have resulted in huge methane emitting wetlands.<ref name=\"Ruddiman\"/>\n\n===Changes due to industrial human activity===\n\nIncreases in methane levels due to modern human activities arise from a number of specific sources.\n\n* Methane emissions from industrial activity\n* Methane emissions from extraction of oil and natural gas from underground reserves<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/fracking-boom-tied-to-methane-spike-in-earths-atmosphere/|title=Fracking boom tied to methane spike in Earth's atmosphere|last=|first=|date=2019-08-15|website=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n* Methane emissions from transportation via pipeline of oil and natural gas \n* Methane emissions from melting permafrost in Arctic regions, due to global warming which is caused by human use of fossil fuels\n\n===Emissions due to oil and gas extraction===\n\n====Natural gas pipelines====\nOne source of methane emissions has been identified as pipelines that transport natural gas; one example is pipelines from Russia to customers in Europe.

In accordance with the IPCC and other natural gas emissions control groups, measurements had to be taken throughout the pipeline to measure methane emissions from technological discharges and leaks at the pipeline fittings and vents. Although the majority of the natural gas leaks were carbon dioxide, a significant amount of methane was also being consistently released from the pipeline as a result of leaks and breakdowns. In 2001, natural gas emissions from the pipeline and natural gas transportation system accounted for 1 percent of the natural gas produced.<ref name=\"Wupp\"/> Fortunately, between 2001 and 2005, this number reduced to 0.7 percent, and even the 2001 value is still significantly less than that of 1996.<ref name=\"Wupp\"/>\n\n====General industrial causes====\nHowever, pipeline transportation is only one part of the problem.

Educational resources have begun to be provided for small farms. Management techniques include daily pickup and storage of manure in a completely closed off storage facility that will prevent runoff from making it into bodies of water. The manure can then be kept in storage until it is either reused for fertilizer or taken away and stored in an offsite compost.

Controlling the usage of nitrogen enhancing fertilizer and reducing the amount of nitrogen pollution into the air can both lower inhibition of methane oxidation. Additionally, using drier growing conditions for crops such as rice and selecting strains of crops that produce more food per unit area can reduce the amount of land with ideal conditions for methanogenesis. Careful selection of areas of land conversion (for example, plowing down forests to create agricultural fields) can also reduce the destruction of major areas of methane oxidation.\n\nTo counteract methane emissions from landfills, on March 12, 1996, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) added the \"Landfill Rule\" to the Clean Air Act. This rule requires large landfills that have ever accepted [[municipal solid waste]], have been used as of November 8, 1987, can hold at least 2.5&nbsp;million metric tons of waste with a volume greater than 2.5&nbsp;million cubic meters, and/or have nonmethane organic compound (NMOC) emissions of at least 50 metric tons per year to collect and combust emitted [[landfill gas]].<ref name=\"Landfill\">{{cite web |title=Landfill Methane Energy Recovery |publisher=Power Partners |date=December 11, 2009 |url=http://www.uspowerpartners.org/Topics/SECTION6Topic-LandfillMethane.htm |access-date=2016-12-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929005545/http://www.uspowerpartners.org/Topics/SECTION6Topic-LandfillMethane.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2015 |df=}}</ref> This set of requirements excludes 96% of the landfills in the USA.

Gas chromatography is a type of [[chromatography]] used for separating or analyzing chemical compounds. It is less expensive in general, compared to more advanced methods, but it is more time and labor-intensive.\n\n===Spectroscopic method===\n[[Spectroscopic methods]] are the preferred method for atmospheric gas measurements due to its sensitivity and precision. Also, spectroscopic methods are the only way of remotely sensing the atmospheric gases. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] covers a large spectrum of techniques, one of which detects gases based on [[absorption spectroscopy]]. There are various methods for spectroscopic methods, including [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy]], [[Laser-induced fluorescence]], and [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier Transform Infrared]].\n\n====Cavity ring-down spectroscopy====\n[[Cavity ring-down spectroscopy]] is most widely used IR absorption technique of detecting methane.

This uncertainty is exemplified by observations that have shown between the year 2000 and 2006 increases in atmospheric concentration of methane ceased, for reasons still being investigated.<ref name=Kirschke2013>{{cite journal |display-authors=1 |first1=Stefanie |last1=Kirschke |first2=Philippe |last2=Bousquet |first3=Philippe |last3=Ciais |first4=Marielle |last4=Saunois |first5=Josep G. |last5=Canadell |first6=Edward J. |last6=Dlugokencky |first7=Peter |last7=Bergamaschi |first8=Daniel |last8=Bergmann |first9=Donald R. |last9=Blake |first10=Lori |last10=Bruhwiler |first11=Philip |last11=Cameron-Smith |first12=Simona |last12=Castaldi |first13=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last13=Chevallier |first14=Liang |last14=Feng |first15=Annemarie |last15=Fraser |first16=Martin |last16=Heimann |first17=Elke L. |last17=Hodson |first18=Sander |last18=Houweling |first19=B\u00e9atrice |last19=Josse |title=Three decades of global methane sources and sinks |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=813\u2013823 |date=September 22, 2013 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1955 |bibcode=2013NatGe...6..813K |url=https://zenodo.org/record/3425876 }}</ref>\n\nVarious sources give the following values for [[methane emissions]]:\n{|style=\"text-align: right;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of the global methane budget (in Tg({{chem|CH|4}})/yr)<ref name=\"Trace Gases\">{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/134.htm#4211 |title=Trace Gases: Current Observations, Trends, and Budgets |work=Climate Change 2001, IPCC Third Assessment Report |publisher=IPCC/United Nations Environment Programme }}</ref>\n!

In order to produce energy, they use an anaerobic process called methanogenesis. This process is used in lieu of aerobic, or with oxygen, processes because methanogens are unable to metabolise in the presence of even small concentrations of oxygen. When acetate is broken down in methanogenesis, the result is the release of methane into the surrounding environment.\n\n''[[Methanogenesis]]'', the scientific term for methane production, occurs primarily in anaerobic conditions because of the lack of availability of other oxidants. In these conditions, [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] organisms called [[archaea]] use acetate and hydrogen to break down essential resources{{vague|date=February 2016}} in a process called [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].\n\n''Acetoclastic methanogenesis'' \u2013 certain archaea cleave [[acetate]] produced during anaerobic fermentation to yield methane and carbon dioxide.\n\n:H<sub>3</sub>C-COOH \u2192 CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\n''Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis'' \u2013 archaea [[oxidize]] hydrogen with carbon dioxide to yield methane and water.\n\n:4H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nWhile acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are the two major source reactions for atmospheric methane, other minor biological methane source reactions also occur. For example, it has been discovered that [[Epicuticular wax|leaf surface wax]] exposed to [[UV radiation]] in the presence of oxygen is an aerobic source of methane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Leaf surface wax is a source of plant methane formation under UV radiation and in the presence of oxygen |display-authors=1 |last1=Bruhn |first1=D. |last2=Mikkelsen |first2=T.

Some of these microorganisms use the acetate from the plant material to produce methane, and because these bacteria live in the stomachs and intestines of ruminants, whenever the animal \"burps\" or defecates, it emits methane as well. Based upon a study in the [[Snowy Mountains]] region, the amount of methane emitted by one cow is equivalent to the amount of methane that around 3.4 hectares of [[#Removal processes|methanotrophic bacteria]] can consume.<ref name=MasonJones2012>Per this source:<br/> :{{cite book |title=Should Meat be on the Menu? |first1=David |last1=Mason-Jones |year=2012 |publisher=Momentum |isbn=978-1743340608 |page=103 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2Lkp8jmFsFEC|page=103}} }}<br/> research in the Snowy Mountains region of Australia showed 8 tonnes of methane oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria per year on a 1,000 hectare farm. 200 cows on the same farm emitted 5.4 tonnes of methane per year.

In addition to being the largest known sink for atmospheric methane, this reaction is one of the most important sources of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. Following the reaction of methane with the hydroxyl radical, two dominant pathways of methane oxidation exist: [1] which leads to a net production of ozone, and [2] which causes no net ozone change.

This occurs with two different types of bacteria. \"High capacity-low affinity\" methanotrophic bacteria grow in areas of high methane concentration, such as waterlogged soils in wetlands and other moist environments. And in areas of low methane concentration, \"low capacity-high affinity\" methanotrophic bacteria make use of the methane in the atmosphere to grow, rather than relying on methane in their immediate environment.<ref name=\"SoilSink\"/>\n\nForest soils act as good sinks for atmospheric methane because soils are optimally moist for methanotroph activity, and the movement of gases between soil and atmosphere (soil diffusivity) is high.<ref name=\"SoilSink\"/> With a lower water table, any methane in the soil has to make it past the methanotrophic bacteria before it can reach the atmosphere.\n\nWetland soils, however, are often sources of atmospheric methane rather than sinks because the water table is much higher, and the methane can be diffused fairly easily into the air without having to compete with the soil's methanotrophs.\n\n''[[Methanotrophic]] bacteria in soils'' \u2013 Methanotrophic bacteria that reside within soil use methane as a source of carbon in methane oxidation.<ref name=\"SoilSink\">{{cite web |first1=Dave |last1=Reay |title=Methane Sinks \u2212 Soils |work=Greenhouse Gas Online |url=http://www.ghgonline.org/methanesinksoil.htm |accessdate=2016-12-22}}</ref> Methane oxidation allows methanotrophic bacteria to use methane as a source of energy, reacting methane with oxygen and as a result producing carbon dioxide and water.\n\n: CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n====Troposphere====\nThe most effective sink of atmospheric methane is the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere, or the lowest portion of Earth's atmosphere.

As a result, photochemistry of plants is affected and the removal of methane via the tropospheric hydroxyl radical is reduced. However, growth rates quickly fell due to lower temperatures and global reduction in rainfall.\n\nThe cause of the 1998 spike is unresolved, but scientists are currently attributing it to a combination of increased wetland and rice field emissions as well as an increased amount of biomass burning. 1998 was also the warmest year since surface temperatures were first recorded, suggesting that anomalously high temperatures can induce elevated methane emission.<ref name=\"IPCC7\">{{cite web |author=Denman, K.L. |title=7.

For both natural and anthropogenic sources, higher temperatures and higher water levels result in the anaerobic environment that is necessary for methane production.\n\n===Natural methane cycles===\nEmissions of methane into the atmosphere are directly related to temperature and moisture. Thus, the natural environmental changes that occur during seasonal change act as a major control of methane emission. Additionally, even changes in temperature during the day can affect the amount of methane that is produced and consumed.\n\nFor example, plants that produce methane can emit as much as two to four times more methane during the day than during the night.<ref name=\"Bubier\"/> This is directly related to the fact that plants tend to rely on solar energy to enact chemical processes.\n\nAdditionally, methane emissions are affected by the level of water sources. Seasonal flooding during the spring and summer naturally increases the amount of methane released into the air.\n\n==Changes due to human activity==\n\n===Changes due to pre-industrial human activity===\n\nThe most clearly identified rise in atmospheric methane as a result of human activity occurred in the 1700s during the industrial revolution. As technology increased at a considerable rate, humans began to build factories and plants, burn fossil fuels for energy, and clear out forests and other vegetation for the purpose of building and agriculture. This growth continued to rise at a rate of almost 1 percent per year until around 1990 when growth rates dropped to almost zero.<ref name=\"IPPC2\"/>\n\nA 2003 article from William F. Ruddiman, however, indicates that the anthropogenic change in methane may have started 5000 years prior to the industrial revolution.<ref name=\"Ruddiman\"/> The methane [[insolation]] cycles of the ice core remained stable and predictable until 5000 years ago, most likely due to some anthropogenic effect.<ref name=\"Ruddiman\"/> Ruddiman suggests that the transition of humans from hunter gatherers into agricultural farming was the first instance of humans affecting methane concentration in the atmosphere. Ruddiman's hypothesis is supported by the fact that early rice irrigation occurred approximately 5000 years ago\u2014the same time the ice core cycles lost their predictability. Due to the inefficiency of humans first learning how to grow rice, extensive rice paddies would have been needed to feed even a small population. These, over-flooded and filled with weeds, would have resulted in huge methane emitting wetlands.<ref name=\"Ruddiman\"/>\n\n===Changes due to industrial human activity===\n\nIncreases in methane levels due to modern human activities arise from a number of specific sources.\n\n* Methane emissions from industrial activity\n* Methane emissions from extraction of oil and natural gas from underground reserves<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/fracking-boom-tied-to-methane-spike-in-earths-atmosphere/|title=Fracking boom tied to methane spike in Earth's atmosphere|last=|first=|date=2019-08-15|website=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n* Methane emissions from transportation via pipeline of oil and natural gas \n* Methane emissions from melting permafrost in Arctic regions, due to global warming which is caused by human use of fossil fuels\n\n===Emissions due to oil and gas extraction===\n\n====Natural gas pipelines====\nOne source of methane emissions has been identified as pipelines that transport natural gas; one example is pipelines from Russia to customers in Europe.

In accordance with the IPCC and other natural gas emissions control groups, measurements had to be taken throughout the pipeline to measure methane emissions from technological discharges and leaks at the pipeline fittings and vents. Although the majority of the natural gas leaks were carbon dioxide, a significant amount of methane was also being consistently released from the pipeline as a result of leaks and breakdowns. In 2001, natural gas emissions from the pipeline and natural gas transportation system accounted for 1 percent of the natural gas produced.<ref name=\"Wupp\"/> Fortunately, between 2001 and 2005, this number reduced to 0.7 percent, and even the 2001 value is still significantly less than that of 1996.<ref name=\"Wupp\"/>\n\n====General industrial causes====\nHowever, pipeline transportation is only one part of the problem.

Educational resources have begun to be provided for small farms. Management techniques include daily pickup and storage of manure in a completely closed off storage facility that will prevent runoff from making it into bodies of water. The manure can then be kept in storage until it is either reused for fertilizer or taken away and stored in an offsite compost. Nutrient levels of various animal manures are provided for optimal use as compost for gardens and agriculture.<ref name=\"Bradley\">{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Athena Lee |publisher=Northeast Recycling Council, Inc |date=June 2008 |title=Manure Management for Small and Hobby Farms |url=http://www.nerc.org/documents/manure_management/manure_management_handbook.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn order to reduce effects on methane oxidation in soil, several steps can be taken. Controlling the usage of nitrogen enhancing fertilizer and reducing the amount of nitrogen pollution into the air can both lower inhibition of methane oxidation. Additionally, using drier growing conditions for crops such as rice and selecting strains of crops that produce more food per unit area can reduce the amount of land with ideal conditions for methanogenesis. Careful selection of areas of land conversion (for example, plowing down forests to create agricultural fields) can also reduce the destruction of major areas of methane oxidation.\n\nTo counteract methane emissions from landfills, on March 12, 1996, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) added the \"Landfill Rule\" to the Clean Air Act. This rule requires large landfills that have ever accepted [[municipal solid waste]], have been used as of November 8, 1987, can hold at least 2.5&nbsp;million metric tons of waste with a volume greater than 2.5&nbsp;million cubic meters, and/or have nonmethane organic compound (NMOC) emissions of at least 50 metric tons per year to collect and combust emitted [[landfill gas]].<ref name=\"Landfill\">{{cite web |title=Landfill Methane Energy Recovery |publisher=Power Partners |date=December 11, 2009 |url=http://www.uspowerpartners.org/Topics/SECTION6Topic-LandfillMethane.htm |access-date=2016-12-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929005545/http://www.uspowerpartners.org/Topics/SECTION6Topic-LandfillMethane.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2015 |df=}}</ref> This set of requirements excludes 96% of the landfills in the USA.

It is less expensive in general, compared to more advanced methods, but it is more time and labor-intensive.\n\n===Spectroscopic method===\n[[Spectroscopic methods]] are the preferred method for atmospheric gas measurements due to its sensitivity and precision. Also, spectroscopic methods are the only way of remotely sensing the atmospheric gases. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] covers a large spectrum of techniques, one of which detects gases based on [[absorption spectroscopy]]. There are various methods for spectroscopic methods, including [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy]], [[Laser-induced fluorescence]], and [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier Transform Infrared]].\n\n====Cavity ring-down spectroscopy====\n[[Cavity ring-down spectroscopy]] is most widely used IR absorption technique of detecting methane. It is a form of [[laser absorption spectroscopy]] which determines the mole fraction to the order of parts per trillion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nakaema|first=Walter M.|last2=Hao|first2=Zuo-Qiang|last3=Rohwetter|first3=Philipp|last4=W\u00f6ste|first4=Ludger|last5=Stelmaszczyk|first5=Kamil|date=2011-01-27|title=PCF-Based Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopic Sensors for Simultaneous Multicomponent Trace Gas Analysis|journal=Sensors|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=1620\u20131640|doi=10.3390/s110201620|issn=1424-8220|pmc=3274003|pmid=22319372}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Climate change]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2005/02/01/global_warming_methane_could_be_far_worse_than_carbon_dioxide.htm Methane in tundra and oceans to be released in atmosphere]\n* [http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/4/993/2007/bgd-4-993-2007.html Methane hydrate stability and anthropogenic climate change] Biogeosciences Discuss., 4, 993\u20131057, 2007\n* [http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/200409_methane/ Methane: A Scientific Journey from Obscurity to Climate Super-Stardom] Good Sept. 2004 background report from NASA [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS)\n* [https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i27/Methanes-Role-Climate-Change.html Methane\u2019s Role In Climate Change:Whether natural gas is a savior or destroyer of climate depends on how much is leaking into the atmosphere], By Jeff Johnson, Chemical & Engineering News.\n* [https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/06/07/study-fertilizer-industry-emits-100-times-more-methane-than-thought/ Study Suggests EPA May Seriously Underestimate Methane Gas Emissions]\n*[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/06/06/methane-levels-are-rising-and-scientists-dont-know-why/ Methane Levels Are Rising, and Scientists Don\u2019t Know Why], By Roni Dengler | June 6, 2019\n*[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GB006009 Very Strong Atmospheric Methane Growth in the 4 Years 2014\u20132017: Implications for the Paris Agreement], Feb 5, 2019.\n*[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6444/966.14.full?intcmp=trendmd-sci Why is methane rising?], Julia Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, 07 Jun 2019.\n* [https://theconversation.com/methane-emissions-from-oil-and-gas-exploration-are-under-reported-116314 Methane emissions from oil and gas exploration are under-reported] June 26, 2019.\n\n{{global warming}}\n\n[[Category:Methane]]\n[[Category:Atmosphere]]\n[[Category:Climate forcing]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane"}

Savin to investigate the wonders from the relics. In the 18th century, manuscripts of his [[hagiography]] and [[Biblical canon|canon]] were preserved at the Lubensk Monastery.\n\nIn 1818, Methodius (Pishnyachevsky), bishop of Poltava, applied the [[Most Holy Synod]] for the canonization of Athanasius, but the application was declined. However the saint's honouring and recorded wonders from his relics continued. In the 1860s, church historian [[Andrey Nikolayevich Muravyov]] created a new hagiography of Athanasius with examples of wonders at his relics.\n\nThe history of the canonization of Athanasius is vague, but the official honouring began in the Russian Church by the end of the 19th century, although [[Yevgeny Golubinsky]] through his works proved that the honouring started between 1672 and 1676 under Joseph (Nelyubovich-Tukalsky), metropolitan of Kiev (Constantinople Orthodox Church).\n\nIn 1922, the Transfiguration cathedral, including the saint's silver throne, was plundered by the [[Bolsheviks]].

En route he made a visit to Bohdan Khmelnytsky. In February 1654 he stayed at the Mhar Monastery near Lubensk and died on 5 April on Thomas' Week. He was buried by the [[hegumen]] of the Transfiguration monastery, his body was in a sitting position on the throne under the [[ambon (liturgy)|ambon]].\n\n== Veneration ==\n[[File:Shrine of saint Afanasy Patellary.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Shrine of en. Athanasius at the Lubensk Monastery. [[Lithography]], 1868]]\nOn 1 February 1662, the saint's relics were [[translation (relics)|translated]] due to  the [[metropolitan of Gaza]] [[Paisios Ligaridis]], who, visiting [[Lubensk Monastery]], had a vision of Athanasius during his sleep.\nIn 1672, the Tsar requested [[podyachy]] M. Savin to investigate the wonders from the relics. In the 18th century, manuscripts of his [[hagiography]] and [[Biblical canon|canon]] were preserved at the Lubensk Monastery.\n\nIn 1818, Methodius (Pishnyachevsky), bishop of Poltava, applied the [[Most Holy Synod]] for the canonization of Athanasius, but the application was declined. However the saint's honouring and recorded wonders from his relics continued. In the 1860s, church historian [[Andrey Nikolayevich Muravyov]] created a new hagiography of Athanasius with examples of wonders at his relics.\n\nThe history of the canonization of Athanasius is vague, but the official honouring began in the Russian Church by the end of the 19th century, although [[Yevgeny Golubinsky]] through his works proved that the honouring started between 1672 and 1676 under Joseph (Nelyubovich-Tukalsky), metropolitan of Kiev (Constantinople Orthodox Church).\n\nIn 1922, the Transfiguration cathedral, including the saint's silver throne, was plundered by the [[Bolsheviks]]. The relics were moved to [[Kharkov]] in the 1930s. They were eventually preserved in the city's [[Annunciation Cathedral, Kharkiv|Annunciation Cathedral]] in 1947.\n[[File:Afanasij of Kharkov oil.JPG|thumb|95px|Oil from the relics of Patriarch Athanasius]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n# ''A.
