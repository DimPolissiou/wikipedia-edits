Eichler's interpretation in contrast to common translations for many years that rendered it as \u201cwho sits upon the cherubim\u201d.

While they first appear in chapter one, in which they are transporting the throne of God by the river Chebar, they are not called ''cherubim'' until chapter 10.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}</ref> In Ezekiel 1:5\u201311 they are described as having the likeness of a man, and having four faces: that of a man, a lion (on the right side), and ox (on the left side), and an eagle.

Under their wings are human hands; their legs are described as straight, and their feet like those of a calf, shining like polished brass. Between the creatures glowing coals that moved between them could be seen, their fire \"went up and down\", and lightning burst forth from it. The cherubs also moved like flashes of lightning.\n\nIn Ezekiel chapter 10, another full description of the cherubim appears with slight differences in details. Three of the four faces are the same \u2013 man, lion and eagle \u2013 but where chapter one has the face of an ox, Ezekiel 10:14 says \"face of a cherub\". Ezekiel equates the cherubim of chapter ten with the living creatures of chapter one: \"They were the same creatures (\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4) I had seen by the river Chebar\" (Ezekiel 10:15) and \"These were the living creatures I had seen under the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] on the banks of the river Chebar\" (Ezekiel 10:20). In Ezekiel 41:18\u201320, they are portrayed as having two faces, although this is probably because they are depicted in profile.<ref name=\"Wood2-4\" />\n\n==In Judaism==\nIn rabbinic literature, the two ''cherubim'' are described as being human-like figures with wings, one a boy and the other a girl, placed on the opposite ends of the [[Mercy seat]] in the inner-sanctum of God's house.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Sukkah'' 5b)</ref> The figures painted on the walls of the [[Second Temple#Herod's Temple|Herodian reconstruction of the Temple]] were are called \"cherubim\" in the [[Babylonian Talmud]].<ref>[[Yoma]] 54a: \"it had painted Cherubim, as it is written.\"</ref>\n\nMany forms of [[Judaism]] include a belief in the existence of angels, including cherubim within the [[Jewish angelic hierarchy]]. The existence of angels is generally accepted within traditional [[rabbinic Judaism]]. There is, however, a wide range of beliefs within Judaism about what angels actually are and how literally one should interpret biblical passages associated with them.\n\nIn [[Kabbalah]] there has long been a strong belief in cherubim, with the cherubim and other angels regarded as having mystical roles. The ''[[Zohar]]'', a highly significant collection of books in Jewish mysticism, states that the cherubim were led by one of their number named Kerubiel.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia2\" />\n\nOn the other end of the philosophical spectrum is [[Maimonides]], who had a neo-Aristotelian interpretation of the Bible. Maimonides writes that to the wise man, one sees that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as \"angels\" are actually allusions to the various laws of nature; they are the principles by which the physical universe operates.{{quote|For all forces are angels! How blind, how perniciously blind are the naive?! If you told someone who purports to be a sage of Israel that the Deity sends an angel who enters a woman's womb and there forms an embryo, he would think this a miracle and accept it as a mark of the majesty and power of the Deity, despite the fact that he believes an angel to be a body of fire one third the size of the entire world. All this, he thinks, is possible for God. But if you tell him that God placed in the sperm the power of forming and demarcating these organs, and that ''this'' is the angel, or that all forms are produced by the Active Intellect; that here is the angel, the \"vice-regent of the world\" constantly mentioned by the sages, then he will recoil.\u2013 ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:4}}{{quote|For he [the naive person] does not understand that the true majesty and power are in the bringing into being of forces which are active in a thing although they cannot be perceived by the senses...

How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind, and how disturbing to the primitive.\" \u2013 ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:6.}}[[Maimonides]] says that the figures of the cherubim were placed in the sanctuary only to preserve among the people the belief in angels, there being two in order that the people might not be led to believe that they were the image of God.<ref>''The Guide for the Perplexed'' III:45</ref>\n\nCherubim are discussed within the [[midrash]] literature. The two cherubim placed by [[God]] at the entrance of paradise (Gen. iii. 24) were angels created on the third day, and therefore they had no definite shape; appearing either as men or women, or as spirits or angelic beings (Genesis Rabbah xxi., end). The cherubim were the first objects created in the universe (Tanna debe Eliyahu R., i. beginning). The following sentence of the Midrash is characteristic: \"When a man sleeps, the body tells to the neshamah (soul) what it has done during the day; the neshamah then reports it to the nefesh (spirit), the nefesh to the angel, the angel to the cherub, and the cherub to the seraph, who then brings it before God\" (Leviticus Rabbah xxii.; Eccl. Rabbah x. 20).\n\nIn early Jewish tradition there existed the notion that cherubim had youthful, human features, due to the etymologization of the name by [[Abbahu]] (3rd century). Before this, some early midrashic literature conceived of the cherubim as non-corporeal.  In the first century AD, [[Josephus]] claimed: \"No one can tell, or even conjecture, what was the shape of these Cherubim.\"(''Antiquities'':8:73).<ref name=\"Wood1\" />\n\nA midrash states that when Pharaoh pursued Israel at the Red Sea, God took a cherub from the wheels of His throne and flew to the spot, for God inspects the heavenly worlds while sitting on a cherub. The cherub, however, is \"something not material,\" and is carried by God, not vice versa (Midr. Teh. xviii. 15; Canticles Rabbah i. 9).\n\nIn the passages of the [[Talmud]] that describe the heavens and their inhabitants, the seraphim, ofannim, and [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] are mentioned, but not the cherubim (\u1e24ag. 12b); and the ancient liturgy also mentions only these three classes.\n\nIn the [[Talmud]], [[Jose the Galilean]] holds<ref>[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 49b</ref> that when the [[Birkat Hamazon]] (grace after meals) is recited by at least ten thousand seated at one meal, a special blessing, \"Blessed is Ha-Shem our God, the God of Israel, [[Shekhinah|who dwells]] between the Cherubim,\" is added to [[Jewish prayer|the regular liturgy]].\n\n== In Christianity ==\n[[File:Maria Scharten - Kreuzigungsaltar 5 Engel.jpg|thumb|Baroque-era cherub from [[Scharten]] church, [[Upper Austria]], \nAltar of the Crucifixion (1667).]]\nIn Medieval [[theology]], following the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], the cherubim are the second highest rank in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|angelic hierarchy]], following the [[seraph]]im.<ref>\"[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeII/CelestialHierarchy.html Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy]\", Chapter VII</ref>\n\nCherubim are regarded in traditional [[Christian angelology]] as angels of the second highest order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cherub?q=cherub|title=Oxford Dictionaries: cherub|year=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> \n''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'' (c. 5th century) lists them alongside [[Seraphim]] and [[Thrones]].<ref name=\"Kosior\"/>\n\nIn Western art, cherubim became associated with the [[putto]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Deity|god]] [[Cupid]]/[[Eros]], with depictions as small, plump, winged boys.<ref name=\"Wood1\" />\n\nArtistic representations of cherubim in Early Christian and [[Byzantine art]] sometimes diverged from scriptural descriptions.

The cherub who appears in the \"Song of David\", a poem which occurs twice in the Hebrew Bible, in [[books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 22 and [[Psalms|Psalm]] 18, participates in Yahweh's [[theophany]] and is imagined as a vehicle upon which the deity descends to earth from heaven in order to rescue the speaker (see 2 Samuel 22:11, Psalm 18:10).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=84\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn Exodus 25:18\u201322, God tells Moses to make multiple images of cherubim at specific points around the [[Ark of the Covenant]].<ref name=\"Wood2-4\" /> Many appearances of the words ''cherub'' and ''cherubim'' in the Bible refer to the gold cherubim images on the [[mercy seat]] of the Ark, as well as images on the curtains of the [[Tabernacle]] and in [[Solomon's Temple]], including two measuring ten cubits high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings%206:23-6:35&version=KJV|title=1 Kings 6:23\u20136:35 KJV \u2013 And within the oracle he made two|date=|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn {{bibleref2|Isaiah|37:16|ESV}}, [[Hezekiah]] prays, addressing God as \"enthroned above the cherubim\" (referring to the [[mercy seat]]).

Eichler's interpretation in contrast to common translations for many years that rendered it as \u201cwho sits upon the cherubim\u201d. This has implications for the understanding of whether the ark of the covenant in the Temple was literally YHWH's throne or simply an indicator of YHWH's immanence.<ref>Eichler, Raanan. \"The Meaning of \u05d4\u05b7\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05bb\u05d1\u05c5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05b9\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05dd.\" ''Zeitschrift F\u00fcr Die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft'' 126 (2014): 358-371. \u00a0</ref> \n\nCherubim feature at some length in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. While they first appear in chapter one, in which they are transporting the throne of God by the river Chebar, they are not called ''cherubim'' until chapter 10.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}</ref> In Ezekiel 1:5\u201311 they are described as having the likeness of a man, and having four faces: that of a man, a lion (on the right side), and ox (on the left side), and an eagle. The four faces represent the four domains of God's rule: the man represents humanity; the lion, wild animals; the ox, domestic animals; and the eagle, birds.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=137}}</ref> These faces peer out from the center of an array of four wings; these wings are joined to each other, two of these are stretched upward, and the other two cover their bodies. Under their wings are human hands; their legs are described as straight, and their feet like those of a calf, shining like polished brass. Between the creatures glowing coals that moved between them could be seen, their fire \"went up and down\", and lightning burst forth from it. The cherubs also moved like flashes of lightning.\n\nIn Ezekiel chapter 10, another full description of the cherubim appears with slight differences in details. Three of the four faces are the same \u2013 man, lion and eagle \u2013 but where chapter one has the face of an ox, Ezekiel 10:14 says \"face of a cherub\". Ezekiel equates the cherubim of chapter ten with the living creatures of chapter one: \"They were the same creatures (\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4) I had seen by the river Chebar\" (Ezekiel 10:15) and \"These were the living creatures I had seen under the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] on the banks of the river Chebar\" (Ezekiel 10:20). In Ezekiel 41:18\u201320, they are portrayed as having two faces, although this is probably because they are depicted in profile.<ref name=\"Wood2-4\" />\n\n==In Judaism==\nIn rabbinic literature, the two ''cherubim'' are described as being human-like figures with wings, one a boy and the other a girl, placed on the opposite ends of the [[Mercy seat]] in the inner-sanctum of God's house.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Sukkah'' 5b)</ref> The figures painted on the walls of the [[Second Temple#Herod's Temple|Herodian reconstruction of the Temple]] were are called \"cherubim\" in the [[Babylonian Talmud]].<ref>[[Yoma]] 54a: \"it had painted Cherubim, as it is written.\"</ref>\n\nMany forms of [[Judaism]] include a belief in the existence of angels, including cherubim within the [[Jewish angelic hierarchy]]. The existence of angels is generally accepted within traditional [[rabbinic Judaism]]. There is, however, a wide range of beliefs within Judaism about what angels actually are and how literally one should interpret biblical passages associated with them.\n\nIn [[Kabbalah]] there has long been a strong belief in cherubim, with the cherubim and other angels regarded as having mystical roles. The ''[[Zohar]]'', a highly significant collection of books in Jewish mysticism, states that the cherubim were led by one of their number named Kerubiel.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia2\" />\n\nOn the other end of the philosophical spectrum is [[Maimonides]], who had a neo-Aristotelian interpretation of the Bible. Maimonides writes that to the wise man, one sees that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as \"angels\" are actually allusions to the various laws of nature; they are the principles by which the physical universe operates.{{quote|For all forces are angels! How blind, how perniciously blind are the naive?! If you told someone who purports to be a sage of Israel that the Deity sends an angel who enters a woman's womb and there forms an embryo, he would think this a miracle and accept it as a mark of the majesty and power of the Deity, despite the fact that he believes an angel to be a body of fire one third the size of the entire world. All this, he thinks, is possible for God. But if you tell him that God placed in the sperm the power of forming and demarcating these organs, and that ''this'' is the angel, or that all forms are produced by the Active Intellect; that here is the angel, the \"vice-regent of the world\" constantly mentioned by the sages, then he will recoil.\u2013 ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:4}}{{quote|For he [the naive person] does not understand that the true majesty and power are in the bringing into being of forces which are active in a thing although they cannot be perceived by the senses... Thus the Sages reveal to the aware that the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a '''cherub'''. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind, and how disturbing to the primitive.\" \u2013 ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:6.}}[[Maimonides]] says that the figures of the cherubim were placed in the sanctuary only to preserve among the people the belief in angels, there being two in order that the people might not be led to believe that they were the image of God.<ref>''The Guide for the Perplexed'' III:45</ref>\n\nCherubim are discussed within the [[midrash]] literature. The two cherubim placed by [[God]] at the entrance of paradise (Gen. iii. 24) were angels created on the third day, and therefore they had no definite shape; appearing either as men or women, or as spirits or angelic beings (Genesis Rabbah xxi., end). The cherubim were the first objects created in the universe (Tanna debe Eliyahu R., i. beginning). The following sentence of the Midrash is characteristic: \"When a man sleeps, the body tells to the neshamah (soul) what it has done during the day; the neshamah then reports it to the nefesh (spirit), the nefesh to the angel, the angel to the cherub, and the cherub to the seraph, who then brings it before God\" (Leviticus Rabbah xxii.; Eccl. Rabbah x. 20).\n\nIn early Jewish tradition there existed the notion that cherubim had youthful, human features, due to the etymologization of the name by [[Abbahu]] (3rd century). Before this, some early midrashic literature conceived of the cherubim as non-corporeal.  In the first century AD, [[Josephus]] claimed: \"No one can tell, or even conjecture, what was the shape of these Cherubim.\"(''Antiquities'':8:73).<ref name=\"Wood1\" />\n\nA midrash states that when Pharaoh pursued Israel at the Red Sea, God took a cherub from the wheels of His throne and flew to the spot, for God inspects the heavenly worlds while sitting on a cherub. The cherub, however, is \"something not material,\" and is carried by God, not vice versa (Midr. Teh. xviii. 15; Canticles Rabbah i. 9).\n\nIn the passages of the [[Talmud]] that describe the heavens and their inhabitants, the seraphim, ofannim, and [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] are mentioned, but not the cherubim (\u1e24ag. 12b); and the ancient liturgy also mentions only these three classes.\n\nIn the [[Talmud]], [[Jose the Galilean]] holds<ref>[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 49b</ref> that when the [[Birkat Hamazon]] (grace after meals) is recited by at least ten thousand seated at one meal, a special blessing, \"Blessed is Ha-Shem our God, the God of Israel, [[Shekhinah|who dwells]] between the Cherubim,\" is added to [[Jewish prayer|the regular liturgy]].\n\n== In Christianity ==\n[[File:Maria Scharten - Kreuzigungsaltar 5 Engel.jpg|thumb|Baroque-era cherub from [[Scharten]] church, [[Upper Austria]], \nAltar of the Crucifixion (1667).]]\nIn Medieval [[theology]], following the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], the cherubim are the second highest rank in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|angelic hierarchy]], following the [[seraph]]im.<ref>\"[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeII/CelestialHierarchy.html Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy]\", Chapter VII</ref>\n\nCherubim are regarded in traditional [[Christian angelology]] as angels of the second highest order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cherub?q=cherub|title=Oxford Dictionaries: cherub|year=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> \n''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'' (c. 5th century) lists them alongside [[Seraphim]] and [[Thrones]].<ref name=\"Kosior\"/>\n\nIn Western art, cherubim became associated with the [[putto]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Deity|god]] [[Cupid]]/[[Eros]], with depictions as small, plump, winged boys.<ref name=\"Wood1\" />\n\nArtistic representations of cherubim in Early Christian and [[Byzantine art]] sometimes diverged from scriptural descriptions.
