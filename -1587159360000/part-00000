There are also features from the 13th and 14th century, and evidence of significant restoration in the 19th century, when it was re-roofed in Welsh [[slate]]. A new south window was fitted in the chancel at this time. The pulpit came from Derby cathedral, and there is a second font, which carries the date 1662.

The Stanton Ironworks Company leased the mineral rights in 1872, and work on building the shaft for [[Pleasley Colliery]] began soon afterwards. Stanton's continued to operate it until nationalisation in 1946, after which it was run by the [[National Coal Board]] until it closed in 1983, with some of the workforce transferring to nearby [[Shirebrook]] colliery from where the accessible remaining underground coal reserves were mined.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasley-colliery.org.uk/html/about_.html |title= About Pleasley Colliery |publisher=Friends of Pleasley Pit |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> The mine was partly demolished but during the demolition it was realised that the pit winding engines were the only pair of such engines left. The former mine is now a museum. The spoil heaps have been turned into a large nature reserve, complete with large ponds, cycle and walking tracks.\n\nPleasley, as a whole, spreads into two counties, with the old coal mine high above the old village centre and a series of very large old weaving mills below in the Vale being the historic main industries, together with farming.\n\n== Education ==\nPleasley has two primary schools, one on the Nottinghamshire side of the village and one on the Derbyshire side.\n\n=== Anthony Bek Primary School ===\nAnthony Bek Primary School is located on the Derbyshire side of the village. First opened in 1899, the school is named after [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Antony Bek]], a [[Bishop of Durham]]. The Bek family acquired half of the manor of Pleasley in 1280 and Anthony often returned during the crusades with Prince Edward.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=L|last2=Crowl|first2=G|date=1961|title=Surficial Geology, Rustico, East Half, Prince Edward Island|doi=10.4095/108783}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthonybek.com/school-history/|title=School History {{!}} Anthony Bek Community Primary and Nursery School|website=www.anthonybek.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>  The school is situated on Rotherham Road, on the opposite side of the bypass to the village centre.\n\n=== Farmilo Primary School ===\nFarmilo Primary School is situated on the Nottinghamshire side of the village, close to the Radmanthwaite estate.  Farmilo Primary School was originally situated on Chesterfield Road North where it was built in 1920, and is named for Councillor Farmilo who campaigned to have the school built.  The school moved to its present location on Woburn Lane in the early 1970s.  In 2017 the school took over the adjacent [[Sure Start]] centre and extended into it.  \n[[File:Anthony Bek Community Primary School.jpg|left|thumb|Anthony Bek Primary School]]\n\n==The localities of Pleasley==\n[[File:Pleasley Village near Mansfield NG19.jpg|thumb|Meden Square in Pleasley village]]\nThe area of Pleasley itself consists of four distinct areas: Pleasley Village, Upper Pleasley, Pleasley Hill with the Radmanthwaite Estate and Pleasley Vale..  Pleasley Village[[File:Pleasley Colliery - geograph.org.uk - 292339.jpg|thumb|Pleasley Colliery in its restored state in 2006 as a museum and visitors centre]]\nPleasley Village is the oldest part at the lowest point where the River Meden flows through the valley with a dam and [[mill pond]] in the centre of the village. Some original buildings remain, built from local [[sandstone]], noticeably around the [[Watermill|old mill site]], and the two [[pub]]s.\n\n===Upper Pleasley===\nUpper Pleasley is situated at the southern end of the village, and is today the area around Terrace Lane.  Terrace Lane was initially surrounded by fields, and eventually served as the back entrance to [[Pleasley Colliery]], which is still visible today.  Between 1875\u20131899, two rows of terraced houses were built on what is now Old Terrace.  These were built for workers at the colliery.  Private bungalows were built along Terrace Lane, and in the 1920s, more pit houses were built on New Terrace, and along the top of Terrace Lane.\n\nThe terraced houses on Old Terrace were demolished in the 1970s, and the land stood empty for 30 years.  In the early 2000s, this land was built on and a new estate was built, with two new cul-de-sacs being built, and new houses being built along Old Terrace.  In 2009, the older houses on New Terrace were demolished, and the remaining houses renovated.  New homes were built in the place of the demolished houses, following the existing road layout.\n\n===Pleasley Hill===\n[[File:Pleasley - terrace on Chesterfield Road - geograph.org.uk - 1525709.jpg|thumb|Former view up Pleasley Hill showing now-demolished terraced housing]]\nPleasley Hill is an area in Mansfield, adjacent to Pleasley. It once consisted of rows of derelict terraced houses running along the main A617 road leading from Glapwell and the Pleasley By-pass towards Mansfield.\n\nThese were the subject of lengthy debate in the area, and were demolished in 2013.  In 2015, new houses were built on the land.\n\nA small amount of housing regeneration was created by seven derelict terraced homes on Hillmoor Street being sold by Mansfield District Council to a social enterprise group named ''TREES'' for just one pound.

The Pleasley Hill section is a steep, old winding single-carriageway which was scheduled for an improvement scheme designated ''Pleasley By-pass Extension'', a [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] initiative intended to link the A617 Chesterfield Road North and [[Mansfield#Regeneration|MARR]] junction to the existing Pleasley By-pass, a long-established dual-carriageway created by [[Derbyshire County Council]] which terminates on the Nottinghamshire side at the base of Pleasley Hill.\n\nThe intended extension situated on the Nottinghamshire side has never been scheduled, and remains as a 'missing' section and [[traffic bottleneck|bottleneck]] to the MARR route. Three proposals were mooted in 2004 with two alternate routes:\n\n1. A single carriageway upgrade of the existing Pleasley Hill route<br>2. A single carriageway extension from the MARR junction at the top of Pleasley Hill routed through land running at the back of the old cemetery<br>3. A dual carriageway extension from the MARR junction at the top of Pleasley Hill routed through land running at the back of the old cemetery.<ref>[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/70311195/Pleasley-Bypass-Extension] Pleasley-Bypass-Extension plans Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref>\n\nNottinghamshire County Council summarised the scheme as:<ref>[https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=159716] Nottinghamshire County Council, Local Transport Plan, non-Technical Summary, section 1.7.1 Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref><blockquote>''Pleasley bypass extension has mixed impacts. It has clear economic benefits, and also will reduce accidents, pollution and noise along the existing route. However these are balanced by adverse effects along the new route, such as possible impact on wildlife and also a nearby primary school''.\n</blockquote>\n\nMansfield District Council summarised the scheme as:<ref>[http://www.mansfield.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=407&p=0] Mansfield District Council local plan section 5.8.5 Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref><blockquote>''As with the Rainworth Bypass this scheme will provide considerable environmental benefits and will be an important component in improving links between the District and the M1, via junction 29. Depending on finance being made available it is anticipated that construction of this proposal will commence after 2000/2001''.</blockquote>\n\nDespite extensive planning and preparation, the road scheme was abandoned by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]]'s allocation of regional transport funding in 2009.<ref>[http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/medai/jul09-regional-roads-dropped] Campaign for Better Transport, 29 July 2009 ''Road schemes abandoned as Government approves regional transport priorities'' Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref>\n\n===Pleasley Vale===\nPleasley Vale is a deep, narrow valley, much of which is wooded, which has been formed by the River Meden cutting down through the underlying limestone escarpment.<ref name=butler>Butler (1997), Section 1, 3</ref> The Vale has been the location for industry since at least 1767, when two forges and a corn mill are known to have been operating, powered by the river. The forges were run by George Sitwell, and were called Nether and Upper forge. The engineered river channel made it a good site for further development, and a consortium of businessmen from Nottingham and [[Drapery|drapers]] from [[Mansfield]] leased the vale and Pleasley Park in 1782, to construct water-powered [[cotton mill]]s. The Upper Mill was built first, on the site of the previous corn mill, and was operational by 1785. The Lower Mill was completed seven years later at a cost of \u00a31,190, and was much bigger. A manager's house and a row of ten houses for the workers was also completed in 1792. The mills supplied cotton to the expanding East Midland [[hosiery]] industry. One of the original three businessmen was Henry Hollins, and by the early 18th century, the mills were run by William Hollins and Co. They were the first and one of the most successful cotton producers in the East Midlands.<ref>Mansfield (2009), p.11</ref>\n\n[[File:Pleasley Mills - geograph.org.uk - 121575.jpg|thumb|left|Mill 1 at Pleasley Vale, with the mill pond in the foreground]]\nThe Hollins family managed the mills for many years, but from the 1830s were joined by the Pagets, who introduced steam power to the mills. Fire destroyed the Upper Mill on 25 December 1840, but it was rebuilt by 1844. The Lower Mill also burnt down, and was replaced in 1847. Newer equipment fitted as part of the rebuilding enabled the mills to stay competitive. William Hollins lived at Pleasley Vale, and oversaw the expansion of the community, with the construction of more houses for the workers, the provision of public facilities including a school, wash house, and a cooperative society, and attention to leisure activities by the establishing of a [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics Institute]], a library and a cricket club. A company farm was also established. St Chad's Chapel and the vicarage were commissioned by Charles Paget in 1876.<ref>Mansfield (2009), pp.12\u201313</ref> The Chapel was opened in 1881, but was reputedly built in 1861 at Stuffynwood, [[Derbyshire]], and later moved to its present site. It has a small bell turret at its western end, and a number of its features mimic thirteenth and fourteenth century styles. Internally, there is a brass memorial to Paget and his wife Helen Elizabeth.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1251819 |accessdate=10 June 2011}} Church of St Chad, Pleasley</ref>\n\nFrom the 1890s, the mills produced Viyella, a mixture of cotton with Merino wool, which produces a soft fabric.<ref name=mansfield/> A third mill (now called Mill 2) was built between the upper and lower mills in 1913.<ref name=millpanel>''Interpretation panel, Reception area, Mill 1''. Bolsover District Council</ref> It was originally built as a [[combing]] shed, where the cotton fibres were straightened and aligned prior to the production of fabric, but became a mill in 1952 following the addition of a further two floors to the main building, and a three-storey extension on the side. The mills continued to flourish, employing 980 workers at the site in 1934. Transport of raw materials and finished product was provided by the [[Midland Railway]], who opened their Tibshelf and Pleasley branch in 1883, primarily to serve Pleasley Colliery, which began production in 1878.<ref name=mansfield>Mansfield (2009), pp.13\u201316</ref> The branch connected with other lines at [[Mansfield Woodhouse]] in the east and [[Alfreton]] in the west.

The [[River Meden]], which forms the county boundary in this area, runs through the village.\n\nThe bulk of the village is in the Derbyshire district of [[Bolsover (borough)|Bolsover]], and constitutes a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of the same name. The population of this civil parish at the 2011 Census was 2,305.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11127606&c=Pleasley&d=16&e=62&g=6413099&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1458302749602&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref> The part in Nottinghamshire is in the district of [[Mansfield (district)|Mansfield]] and is unparished.

There are also features from the 13th and 14th century, and evidence of significant restoration in the 19th century, when it was re-roofed in Welsh [[slate]]. A new south window was fitted in the chancel at this time. The pulpit came from Derby cathedral, and there is a second font, which carries the date 1662.

The Stanton Ironworks Company leased the mineral rights in 1872, and work on building the shaft for [[Pleasley Colliery]] began soon afterwards. Stanton's continued to operate it until nationalisation in 1946, after which it was run by the [[National Coal Board]] until it closed in 1983, with some of the workforce transferring to nearby [[Shirebrook]] colliery from where the accessible remaining underground coal reserves were mined.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasley-colliery.org.uk/html/about_.html |title= About Pleasley Colliery |publisher=Friends of Pleasley Pit |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> The mine was partly demolished but during the demolition it was realised that the pit winding engines were the only pair of such engines left. The former mine is now a museum. The spoil heaps have been turned into a large nature reserve, complete with large ponds, cycle and walking tracks.\n\nPleasley, as a whole, spreads into two counties, with the old coal mine high above the old village centre and a series of very large old weaving mills below in the Vale being the historic main industries, together with farming.\n\n== Education ==\nPleasley has two primary schools, one on the Nottinghamshire side of the village and one on the Derbyshire side.\n\n=== Anthony Bek Primary School ===\nAnthony Bek Primary School is located on the Derbyshire side of the village. First opened in 1899, the school is named after [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Antony Bek]], a [[Bishop of Durham]]. The Bek family acquired half of the manor of Pleasley in 1280 and Anthony often returned during the crusades with Prince Edward.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=L|last2=Crowl|first2=G|date=1961|title=Surficial Geology, Rustico, East Half, Prince Edward Island|doi=10.4095/108783}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthonybek.com/school-history/|title=School History {{!}} Anthony Bek Community Primary and Nursery School|website=www.anthonybek.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>  The school is situated on Rotherham Road, on the opposite side of the bypass to the village centre.\n\n=== Farmilo Primary School ===\nFarmilo Primary School is situated on the Nottinghamshire side of the village, close to the Radmanthwaite estate.  Farmilo Primary School was originally situated on Chesterfield Road North where it was built in 1920, and is named for Councillor Farmilo who campaigned to have the school built.  The school moved to its present location on Woburn Lane in the early 1970s.  In 2017 the school took over the adjacent [[Sure Start]] centre and extended into it.  \n[[File:Anthony Bek Community Primary School.jpg|left|thumb|Anthony Bek Primary School]]\n\n==The localities of Pleasley==\n[[File:Pleasley Village near Mansfield NG19.jpg|thumb|Meden Square in Pleasley village]]\nThe area of Pleasley itself consists of four distinct areas: Pleasley Village, Upper Pleasley, Pleasley Hill with the Radmanthwaite Estate and Pleasley Vale..  Pleasley Village[[File:Pleasley Colliery - geograph.org.uk - 292339.jpg|thumb|Pleasley Colliery in its restored state in 2006 as a museum and visitors centre]]\nPleasley Village is the oldest part at the lowest point where the River Meden flows through the valley with a dam and [[mill pond]] in the centre of the village. Some original buildings remain, built from local [[sandstone]], noticeably around the [[Watermill|old mill site]], and the two [[pub]]s.\n\n===Upper Pleasley===\nUpper Pleasley is situated at the southern end of the village, and is today the area around Terrace Lane.  Terrace Lane was initially surrounded by fields, and eventually served as the back entrance to [[Pleasley Colliery]], which is still visible today.  Between 1875\u20131899, two rows of terraced houses were built on what is now Old Terrace.  These were built for workers at the colliery.  Private bungalows were built along Terrace Lane, and in the 1920s, more pit houses were built on New Terrace, and along the top of Terrace Lane.\n\nThe terraced houses on Old Terrace were demolished in the 1970s, and the land stood empty for 30 years.  In the early 2000s, this land was built on and a new estate was built, with two new cul-de-sacs being built, and new houses being built along Old Terrace.  In 2009, the older houses on New Terrace were demolished, and the remaining houses renovated.  New homes were built in the place of the demolished houses, following the existing road layout.\n\n===Pleasley Hill===\n[[File:Pleasley - terrace on Chesterfield Road - geograph.org.uk - 1525709.jpg|thumb|Former view up Pleasley Hill showing now-demolished terraced housing]]\nPleasley Hill is an area in Mansfield, adjacent to Pleasley. It once consisted of rows of derelict terraced houses running along the main A617 road leading from Glapwell and the Pleasley By-pass towards Mansfield.\n\nThese were the subject of lengthy debate in the area, and were demolished in 2013.  In 2015, new houses were built on the land.\n\nA small amount of housing regeneration was created by seven derelict terraced homes on Hillmoor Street being sold by Mansfield District Council to a social enterprise group named ''TREES'' for just one pound.

The Pleasley Hill section is a steep, old winding single-carriageway which was scheduled for an improvement scheme designated ''Pleasley By-pass Extension'', a [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] initiative intended to link the A617 Chesterfield Road North and [[Mansfield#Regeneration|MARR]] junction to the existing Pleasley By-pass, a long-established dual-carriageway created by [[Derbyshire County Council]] which terminates on the Nottinghamshire side at the base of Pleasley Hill.\n\nThe intended extension situated on the Nottinghamshire side has never been scheduled, and remains as a 'missing' section and [[traffic bottleneck|bottleneck]] to the MARR route. Three proposals were mooted in 2004 with two alternate routes:\n\n1. A single carriageway upgrade of the existing Pleasley Hill route<br>2. A single carriageway extension from the MARR junction at the top of Pleasley Hill routed through land running at the back of the old cemetery<br>3. A dual carriageway extension from the MARR junction at the top of Pleasley Hill routed through land running at the back of the old cemetery.<ref>[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/70311195/Pleasley-Bypass-Extension] Pleasley-Bypass-Extension plans Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref>\n\nNottinghamshire County Council summarised the scheme as:<ref>[https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=159716] Nottinghamshire County Council, Local Transport Plan, non-Technical Summary, section 1.7.1 Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref><blockquote>''Pleasley bypass extension has mixed impacts. It has clear economic benefits, and also will reduce accidents, pollution and noise along the existing route. However these are balanced by adverse effects along the new route, such as possible impact on wildlife and also a nearby primary school''.\n</blockquote>\n\nMansfield District Council summarised the scheme as:<ref>[http://www.mansfield.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=407&p=0] Mansfield District Council local plan section 5.8.5 Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref><blockquote>''As with the Rainworth Bypass this scheme will provide considerable environmental benefits and will be an important component in improving links between the District and the M1, via junction 29. Depending on finance being made available it is anticipated that construction of this proposal will commence after 2000/2001''.</blockquote>\n\nDespite extensive planning and preparation, the road scheme was abandoned by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]]'s allocation of regional transport funding in 2009.<ref>[http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/medai/jul09-regional-roads-dropped] Campaign for Better Transport, 29 July 2009 ''Road schemes abandoned as Government approves regional transport priorities'' Retrieved 8 February 2014</ref>\n\n===Pleasley Vale===\nPleasley Vale is a deep, narrow valley, much of which is wooded, which has been formed by the River Meden cutting down through the underlying limestone escarpment.<ref name=butler>Butler (1997), Section 1, 3</ref> The Vale has been the location for industry since at least 1767, when two forges and a corn mill are known to have been operating, powered by the river. The forges were run by George Sitwell, and were called Nether and Upper forge. The engineered river channel made it a good site for further development, and a consortium of businessmen from Nottingham and [[Drapery|drapers]] from [[Mansfield]] leased the vale and Pleasley Park in 1782, to construct water-powered [[cotton mill]]s. The Upper Mill was built first, on the site of the previous corn mill, and was operational by 1785. The Lower Mill was completed seven years later at a cost of \u00a31,190, and was much bigger. A manager's house and a row of ten houses for the workers was also completed in 1792. The mills supplied cotton to the expanding East Midland [[hosiery]] industry. One of the original three businessmen was Henry Hollins, and by the early 18th century, the mills were run by William Hollins and Co. They were the first and one of the most successful cotton producers in the East Midlands.<ref>Mansfield (2009), p.11</ref>\n\n[[File:Pleasley Mills - geograph.org.uk - 121575.jpg|thumb|left|Mill 1 at Pleasley Vale, with the mill pond in the foreground]]\nThe Hollins family managed the mills for many years, but from the 1830s were joined by the Pagets, who introduced steam power to the mills. Fire destroyed the Upper Mill on 25 December 1840, but it was rebuilt by 1844. The Lower Mill also burnt down, and was replaced in 1847. Newer equipment fitted as part of the rebuilding enabled the mills to stay competitive. William Hollins lived at Pleasley Vale, and oversaw the expansion of the community, with the construction of more houses for the workers, the provision of public facilities including a school, wash house, and a cooperative society, and attention to leisure activities by the establishing of a [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics Institute]], a library and a cricket club. A company farm was also established. St Chad's Chapel and the vicarage were commissioned by Charles Paget in 1876.<ref>Mansfield (2009), pp.12\u201313</ref> The Chapel was opened in 1881, but was reputedly built in 1861 at Stuffynwood, [[Derbyshire]], and later moved to its present site. It has a small bell turret at its western end, and a number of its features mimic thirteenth and fourteenth century styles. Internally, there is a brass memorial to Paget and his wife Helen Elizabeth.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1251819 |accessdate=10 June 2011}} Church of St Chad, Pleasley</ref>\n\nFrom the 1890s, the mills produced Viyella, a mixture of cotton with Merino wool, which produces a soft fabric.<ref name=mansfield/> A third mill (now called Mill 2) was built between the upper and lower mills in 1913.<ref name=millpanel>''Interpretation panel, Reception area, Mill 1''. Bolsover District Council</ref> It was originally built as a [[combing]] shed, where the cotton fibres were straightened and aligned prior to the production of fabric, but became a mill in 1952 following the addition of a further two floors to the main building, and a three-storey extension on the side. The mills continued to flourish, employing 980 workers at the site in 1934. Transport of raw materials and finished product was provided by the [[Midland Railway]], who opened their Tibshelf and Pleasley branch in 1883, primarily to serve Pleasley Colliery, which began production in 1878.<ref name=mansfield>Mansfield (2009), pp.13\u201316</ref> The branch connected with other lines at [[Mansfield Woodhouse]] in the east and [[Alfreton]] in the west.

Kaylan and Volman later found long-lasting success as [[session musician]]s, billed as the comedic vocal duo Flo & Eddie. In 2010, a reconstituted version of the band, the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie, began performing live shows again.\n\n==History==\nThe band, originally a [[Surf music|surf rock]] group called The Crossfires, was formed in 1965 in [[Westchester, Los Angeles]] by high school friends Kaylan, Volman, [[Al Nichol]], [[Chuck Portz]], [[Don Murray (drummer)|Don Murray]], and Jim Tucker.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1196}}</ref> With the help of [[KRLA]] and [[KFWB]] [[DJ]] and club owner [[Reb Foster]] (born James Dennis Bruton, March 18, 1936 &ndash; August 25, 2019),<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/ \"Reb Foster, One of the 11-10 Men at KRLA, Dies\"], ''LA Radio'', August 26, 2019. Retrieved August 27, 2019</ref> The Crossfires signed to the newly formed [[White Whale Records]]. Adhering to the prevailing musical trend, they rebranded themselves as a [[folk rock]] group under the name The Tyrtles, an intentionally stylized misspelling inspired by [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beatles]]. However, the trendy spelling did not survive long.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAs with the Byrds, the Turtles achieved breakthrough success with a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\" reached the ''Billboard'' Top Ten in the late summer of 1965, and was the title track of the band's first album.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Their second single, \"Let Me Be,\" reached the top 30, while their third hit, \"You Baby,\" charted in the top 20 in early 1966.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band's second album, ''[[You Baby]],'' failed to reach ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s [[Billboard 200|Top LPs]] chart, and of several singles released in 1966, \"[[Grim Reaper of Love]]\" and \"Can I Get to Know You Better\" barely entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. One single, the tough \"Outside Chance\", written by [[Warren Zevon]] and featuring guitar work in the style of The Beatles' \"[[Taxman]]\", did not chart. In 1966, The Turtles made an appearance in [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s [[beach party film|beach party]] [[spy film|spy spoof]] film ''[[Out of Sight (1966 film)|Out of Sight]],'' singing \"She'll Come Back\" on screen.\n\nAt the start of 1966, drummer Don Murray and bassist Chuck Portz quit the group.

Inspired by the revered 1968 concept album ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'', this was Davies's only released production work for another band (although Davies had previously produced demo recordings for [[Badfinger|The Iveys]]).

In spite of ''Turtle Soup''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s positive reception from the music press, its commercial success was marginal and the band soon began to disintegrate.\n\nLong disillusioned with their record label and its growing financial problems by this time, Kaylan and Volman resisted White Whale's efforts to turn the Turtles into something approaching an assembly-line pop act. The label apparently encouraged Kaylan and Volman to fire the rest of the band, tour with hired musicians and make records by adding their vocals to backing tracks recorded by Memphis session players. Such pressure convinced the band to record a single called \"Who Would Ever Think That I Would Ever Marry Margaret?\", which they disowned after its release.\n\nThe Turtles wound down their career in 1970 with a second compilation album, ''More Golden Hits'', and a [[B-sides]] and rarities album, ''[[Wooden Head]]''.

When White Whale's [[master recording]]s were sold at auction in 1974, the duo won the Turtles' masters, making them the owners of their own recorded work. They promptly licensed the tracks to [[Sire Records]], who issued them as a compilation called ''Happy Together Again''.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Kaylan and Volman started their own syndicated radio show called ''Flo & Eddie by the Fireside'', which originated from [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/floandeddiebythefireside|title=Flo and Eddie By The Fireside op Myspace Music \u2013 Gratis Gestreamde MP3s, Fotos, en Videoclips|publisher=Myspace.com|date=|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> In the 1980s, they began hosting their own radio show on [[KROQ-FM]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] in [[New York City]] and recorded [[soundtrack]] music for children's shows like the ''[[Care Bears]]'' and ''[[Strawberry Shortcake]]''.\n\n1982 saw the rerelease of the Turtles' original albums through Rhino Records. The following year, Howard Kaylan appeared in the rock-and-roll comedy film ''[[Get Crazy]]'', starring [[Malcolm McDowell]] and [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]. Kaylan played the part of Captain Cloud, a spiritual guru, leader of a caravan of time-lost [[hippie]]s.\n\nIn 1980, Flo and Eddie performed backing vocals on Alice Cooper's ''Flush The Fashion'' LP. They also sang backup on [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Hungry Heart]]\", from his album ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'', and contributed backing vocals to the self-titled debut album from British new wave band Espionage, produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]] and released in 1983 by [[A&M Records|A&M]] records.\n\nIn 1983, Kaylan and Volman legally regained the use of \"The Turtles\" name and began touring as ''the Turtles... Featuring Flo and Eddie''. Instead of trying to reunite with their earlier bandmates, they began featuring [[all-star]] sidemen who had played with different groups. That year also saw the debut of the previously unreleased ''Shell Shock'' album, as well as a new retrospective CD, ''20 Greatest Hits'', both released by Rhino. The latter compilation was followed up in 1988 with another, ''Turtle Wax: The Best of The Turtles, Vol. 2'', which featured the best of their \"album tracks\" and previously-neglected single B-sides.\n\nIn 1984, the Turtles embarked on a U.S. \"Happy Together\" tour with [[Gary Puckett & The Union Gap]], [[Spanky & Our Gang]] and [[The Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingcenter.com/schedule-of-events/3244-happy-together-tour|title=HAPPY TOGETHER TOUR|website=Kingcenter.com|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\nIn 1987, Kaylan & Volman appeared in a new music video of their song \"Happy Together\" to promote the romantic comedy ''[[Making Mr. Right]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]].\n\nThe 1989 debut album by [[hip hop culture|hip-hop]] combo [[De La Soul]], featured an uncredited sample from the Turtles (specifically, the intro to \"You Showed Me\"), in the song \"Transmitting Live from Mars\". Kaylan and Volman sued, winning a large settlement, setting a legal precedent, and causing the music industry to begin carefully crediting (and paying royalties for) sampled works on future rap and other recordings. As they explained, \"We don't hate sampling; we like sampling. If we don't get credit, we sue, and all that stuff (a share of the royalties, plus punitive damages) comes back to us!\" It was incorrectly reported in 2009 that Volman was involved in another lawsuit against rapper [[Gucci Mane]] for an unauthorized sample; the sample of \"Keep It Warm\" used in Mane's \"Lemonade\" was cleared legitimately prior to the release of the song.\n\nThe romantic comedy ''[[Happy Together (1989 American film)|Happy Together]]'' premiered in 1989, starring [[Patrick Dempsey]] and [[Helen Slater]]. The Turtles' recording of \"Happy Together\" was featured in the film as well as the soundtrack album.\n\nThe 2005 film ''[[Imagine Me & You]]'', the title of which was taken from the first line of the song \"Happy Together\", used the song in its end credits.\n\n[[Music Club Records]] released a Turtles anthology in the U.K. in 1991, ''Happy Together: The Best of the Turtles''. [[Repertoire Records]] in Germany released their own compilation, titled ''Elenore'', in 1993, as well as re-releasing the original ''Happy Together'' album. In that same year, Rhino Records also presented ''Captured Live'', a live album of their 1992 tour. [[Sundazed Records]] re-released all of the Turtles' original albums in 1994, and in 1999 [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released ''Happy Together: The Best of White Whale Records'', which included many of the Turtles' singles.\n\nIn 2002, the film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' used \"Happy Together\" extensively as a device to portray the closeness of the two brothers Kaufman, both played by [[Nicolas Cage]]. The film closes with the Turtles' version over the final credit scroll and time lapse photography.\n\nIn 2009, a new Turtles compilation CD titled ''Save The Turtles: The Turtles Greatest Hits'' was issued on their own FloEdCo label and distributed by [[Manifesto Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Save-Turtles-Greatest-Hits/dp/B001TW68P4|title=Save The Turtles: The Turtles Greatest Hits: Turtles: Music|publisher=Amazon.com|date=|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>\n\nStarting in the summer of 2010, the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie toured throughout the United States as part of the \"Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour\", an [[oldies]] concert series that retained the \"Happy Together\" moniker in subsequent years.

The expanded editions of the six albums contained in the former were also issued separately in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, since Kaylan required heart and back surgery, he was prohibited by his doctors from joining the tour and [[Ron Dante]] (from [[The Archies]]) stood in for him and also did the honors again in the summer of 2019.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:350\nPlotArea = left:80 bottom:120 top:0 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1965 till:01/07/1970\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1965\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1965\n\nColors =\n  id:voc value:red legend:Vocals\n  id:g    value:green legend:Guitars\n  id:key value:purple legend:Keyboards\n  id:b  value:blue legend:Bass\n  id:dr  value:orange legend:Drums\n  id:alb  value:black legend:Studio_releases\n\nLineData =\n  at:01/09/1965 layer:back\n  at:01/03/1966\n  at:29/04/1967\n  at:01/11/1968\n  at:01/10/1969\n\nPlotData =\n  width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,\u20134)\n  bar:Howard&nbsp;Kaylan from:start till:01/07/1970 color:voc\n  bar:Howard&nbsp;Kaylan from:start till:01/07/1970 color:key width:3\n  bar:Mark&nbsp;Volman from:start till:01/07/1970 color:voc\n  bar:Mark&nbsp;Volman from:start till:01/07/1970 color:g width:3\n  bar:Al&nbsp;Nichol from:start till:01/07/1970 color:g\n  bar:Jim&nbsp;Tucker from:start till:01/07/1967 color:g\n  bar:Chuck&nbsp;Portz from:start till:01/07/1966 color:b\n  bar:Chip&nbsp;Douglas from:01/07/1966 till:01/07/1967 color:b\n  bar:Jim&nbsp;Pons from:01/07/1967 till:01/07/1970 color:b\n  bar:Don&nbsp;Murray from:start till:01/05/1966 color:dr\n  bar:Joel&nbsp;Larson from:01/05/1966 till:01/09/1966 color:dr\n  bar:John&nbsp;Barbata from:01/09/1966 till:01/07/1969 color:dr\n  bar:Ran&nbsp;Whitehead from:05/01/1967 till:09/07/1967 color:dr\n\n  bar:John&nbsp;Seiter from:01/07/1969 till:01/07/1970 color:dr\n</timeline>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|The Turtles discography}}\n* ''[[It Ain't Me Babe (album)|It Ain't Me Babe]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[You Baby]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Happy Together (The Turtles album)|Happy Together]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[Turtle Soup]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Wooden Head]]'' (1970)\n* ''Chalon Road'' (1986)\n* ''Shell Shock'' (1986)\n\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.theturtles.com/}}\n\n{{The Turtles|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turtles, The}}\n[[Category:The Turtles| ]]\n[[Category:American pop rock music groups]]\n[[Category:Folk rock groups from California]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1965]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1970]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2010]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic rock music groups from California]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American rock band led by vocalists Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman}}\n{{Distinguish|Turtles (South Korean band)}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = The Turtles\n| image           = The Turtles.png\n| image_size      = \n| landscape       = yes\n| caption         = The Turtles in 1967 (left to right): Al Nichol, [[Chip Douglas]], [[John Barbata]], [[Mark Volman]], Jim Tucker, [[Howard Kaylan]].\n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = The Tyrtles\n| origin          = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States\n| genre           = {{hlist|[[Sunshine pop]]|[[pop rock]]|[[psychedelic pop]]|[[folk rock]]}}\n| years_active    = \n* 1965\u20131970, 1983\u2013present\n| label           = [[White Whale Records|White Whale]]\n| associated_acts = {{hlist|[[Flo & Eddie]]|[[the Mothers of Invention]]}}\n| website         = {{URL|theturtles.com}}\n| current_members = {{unbulleted list|[[Howard Kaylan]]|[[Mark Volman]]}}\n| past_members    = {{unbulleted list|Al Nichol|Jim Tucker|Chuck Portz|[[Don Murray (drummer)|Don Murray]]|[[Joel Larson]]|[[John Barbata]]|[[Chip Douglas]]|[[Jim Pons]]|[[John Seiter]]}}\n}}\n\n'''The Turtles''' are an American [[rock music|rock]] band led by vocalists [[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]], later known as [[Flo & Eddie]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.theturtles.com/ |title=Featuring Flo & Eddie |publisher=The Turtles |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref> The band had several [[Top 40]] hits beginning with their [[cover version]] of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\" in [[1965 in music|1965]].

However, the trendy spelling did not survive long.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAs with the Byrds, the Turtles achieved breakthrough success with a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\" reached the ''Billboard'' Top Ten in the late summer of 1965, and was the title track of the band's first album.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Their second single, \"Let Me Be,\" reached the top 30, while their third hit, \"You Baby,\" charted in the top 20 in early 1966.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band's second album, ''[[You Baby]],'' failed to reach ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s [[Billboard 200|Top LPs]] chart, and of several singles released in 1966, \"[[Grim Reaper of Love]]\" and \"Can I Get to Know You Better\" barely entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. One single, the tough \"Outside Chance\", written by [[Warren Zevon]] and featuring guitar work in the style of The Beatles' \"[[Taxman]]\", did not chart.

Kaylan played the part of Captain Cloud, a spiritual guru, leader of a caravan of time-lost [[hippie]]s.\n\nIn 1980, Flo and Eddie performed backing vocals on Alice Cooper's ''Flush The Fashion'' LP. They also sang backup on [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Hungry Heart]]\", from his album ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'', and contributed backing vocals to the self-titled debut album from British new wave band Espionage, produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]] and released in 1983 by [[A&M Records|A&M]] records.\n\nIn 1983, Kaylan and Volman legally regained the use of \"The Turtles\" name and began touring as ''the Turtles... Featuring Flo and Eddie''. Instead of trying to reunite with their earlier bandmates, they began featuring [[all-star]] sidemen who had played with different groups. That year also saw the debut of the previously unreleased ''Shell Shock'' album, as well as a new retrospective CD, ''20 Greatest Hits'', both released by Rhino. The latter compilation was followed up in 1988 with another, ''Turtle Wax: The Best of The Turtles, Vol. 2'', which featured the best of their \"album tracks\" and previously-neglected single B-sides.\n\nIn 1984, the Turtles embarked on a U.S. \"Happy Together\" tour with [[Gary Puckett & The Union Gap]], [[Spanky & Our Gang]] and [[The Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingcenter.com/schedule-of-events/3244-happy-together-tour|title=HAPPY TOGETHER TOUR|website=Kingcenter.com|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\nIn 1987, Kaylan & Volman appeared in a new music video of their song \"Happy Together\" to promote the romantic comedy ''[[Making Mr. Right]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]].\n\nThe 1989 debut album by [[hip hop culture|hip-hop]] combo [[De La Soul]], featured an uncredited sample from the Turtles (specifically, the intro to \"You Showed Me\"), in the song \"Transmitting Live from Mars\". Kaylan and Volman sued, winning a large settlement, setting a legal precedent, and causing the music industry to begin carefully crediting (and paying royalties for) sampled works on future rap and other recordings. As they explained, \"We don't hate sampling; we like sampling. If we don't get credit, we sue, and all that stuff (a share of the royalties, plus punitive damages) comes back to us!\" It was incorrectly reported in 2009 that Volman was involved in another lawsuit against rapper [[Gucci Mane]] for an unauthorized sample; the sample of \"Keep It Warm\" used in Mane's \"Lemonade\" was cleared legitimately prior to the release of the song.\n\nThe romantic comedy ''[[Happy Together (1989 American film)|Happy Together]]'' premiered in 1989, starring [[Patrick Dempsey]] and [[Helen Slater]]. The Turtles' recording of \"Happy Together\" was featured in the film as well as the soundtrack album.\n\nThe 2005 film ''[[Imagine Me & You]]'', the title of which was taken from the first line of the song \"Happy Together\", used the song in its end credits.\n\n[[Music Club Records]] released a Turtles anthology in the U.K. in 1991, ''Happy Together: The Best of the Turtles''. [[Repertoire Records]] in Germany released their own compilation, titled ''Elenore'', in 1993, as well as re-releasing the original ''Happy Together'' album. In that same year, Rhino Records also presented ''Captured Live'', a live album of their 1992 tour. [[Sundazed Records]] re-released all of the Turtles' original albums in 1994, and in 1999 [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released ''Happy Together: The Best of White Whale Records'', which included many of the Turtles' singles.\n\nIn 2002, the film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' used \"Happy Together\" extensively as a device to portray the closeness of the two brothers Kaufman, both played by [[Nicolas Cage]]. The film closes with the Turtles' version over the final credit scroll and time lapse photography.\n\nIn 2009, a new Turtles compilation CD titled ''Save The Turtles: The Turtles Greatest Hits'' was issued on their own FloEdCo label and distributed by [[Manifesto Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Save-Turtles-Greatest-Hits/dp/B001TW68P4|title=Save The Turtles: The Turtles Greatest Hits: Turtles: Music|publisher=Amazon.com|date=|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>\n\nStarting in the summer of 2010, the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie toured throughout the United States as part of the \"Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour\", an [[oldies]] concert series that retained the \"Happy Together\" moniker in subsequent years. They performed alongside other 1960s and 1970s pop stars including [[Gary Puckett]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Mark Lindsay]], [[Mark Farner]], [[Gary Lewis & the Playboys|Gary Lewis]], and [[Micky Dolenz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neufutur.com/?p=21796|title=Happy Together Tour Returns In Summer 2011|date=April 30, 2011|first=James|last=McQuistion|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref> The 2015 tour featured [[the Buckinghams]], [[the Cowsills]], [[the Grass Roots]], and [[the Association]].\n\nIn 2016, the complete output of The Turtles was reissued as two box sets, ''The Complete Original Album Collection'' and ''All the Singles''. The expanded editions of the six albums contained in the former were also issued separately in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, since Kaylan required heart and back surgery, he was prohibited by his doctors from joining the tour and [[Ron Dante]] (from [[The Archies]]) stood in for him and also did the honors again in the summer of 2019.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:350\nPlotArea = left:80 bottom:120 top:0 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1965 till:01/07/1970\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1965\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1965\n\nColors =\n  id:voc value:red legend:Vocals\n  id:g    value:green legend:Guitars\n  id:key value:purple legend:Keyboards\n  id:b  value:blue legend:Bass\n  id:dr  value:orange legend:Drums\n  id:alb  value:black legend:Studio_releases\n\nLineData =\n  at:01/09/1965 layer:back\n  at:01/03/1966\n  at:29/04/1967\n  at:01/11/1968\n  at:01/10/1969\n\nPlotData =\n  width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,\u20134)\n  bar:Howard&nbsp;Kaylan from:start till:01/07/1970 color:voc\n  bar:Howard&nbsp;Kaylan from:start till:01/07/1970 color:key width:3\n  bar:Mark&nbsp;Volman from:start till:01/07/1970 color:voc\n  bar:Mark&nbsp;Volman from:start till:01/07/1970 color:g width:3\n  bar:Al&nbsp;Nichol from:start till:01/07/1970 color:g\n  bar:Jim&nbsp;Tucker from:start till:01/07/1967 color:g\n  bar:Chuck&nbsp;Portz from:start till:01/07/1966 color:b\n  bar:Chip&nbsp;Douglas from:01/07/1966 till:01/07/1967 color:b\n  bar:Jim&nbsp;Pons from:01/07/1967 till:01/07/1970 color:b\n  bar:Don&nbsp;Murray from:start till:01/05/1966 color:dr\n  bar:Joel&nbsp;Larson from:01/05/1966 till:01/09/1966 color:dr\n  bar:John&nbsp;Barbata from:01/09/1966 till:01/07/1969 color:dr\n  bar:Ran&nbsp;Whitehead from:05/01/1967 till:09/07/1967 color:dr\n\n  bar:John&nbsp;Seiter from:01/07/1969 till:01/07/1970 color:dr\n</timeline>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|The Turtles discography}}\n* ''[[It Ain't Me Babe (album)|It Ain't Me Babe]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[You Baby]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Happy Together (The Turtles album)|Happy Together]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[Turtle Soup]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Wooden Head]]'' (1970)\n* ''Chalon Road'' (1986)\n* ''Shell Shock'' (1986)\n\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.theturtles.com/}}\n\n{{The Turtles|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turtles, The}}\n[[Category:The Turtles| ]]\n[[Category:American pop rock music groups]]\n[[Category:Folk rock groups from California]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1965]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1970]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2010]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic rock music groups from California]]\n", "name_user": "Hulmem", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:fix punc", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtles"}
