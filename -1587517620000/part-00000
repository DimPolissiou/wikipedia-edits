It is encircled almost entirely by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] except in the east, where it is bordered by S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (Lajes do Pico) in the southeast, and Santo Ant\u00f3nio (S\u00e3o Roque do Pico) in the northeast.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:phylloxera cartoon.png|thumb|200px|left|''The phylloxera, a true gourmet, responsible for the destruction of the vineyards in the 19th Century''<br>(Cartoon from [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]], September 6, 1890)]]\nThe settlement of the island of Pico occurred much later than most islands, partly due to greater interest shown in the other islands of the Central Group.  For a time, only small herds, deposited by property-owners from Faial and [[Terceira]], along with their caretakers (some of whom were slaves), were the only inhabitants of the island.  It was not until the [[Infanta]] [[Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu|Beatriz]] proceeded to reorganize island administration and promote a greater colonization of the islands of the Central Group (between 1470 and 1480) that this changed. In 1483, Faial and Pico were integrated into one [[Captaincy]], under the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] [[Josse van Huerter]], and settlers were encouraged to colonize the island of Pico.  But even still, the area of Madalena, with its rocky coastal plain, did not attract many new settlers and the community did not expand significantly until the municipality was created in 1723.\n\nBy the first quarter of the 18th century, the municipality of Madalena was already entrenched in the ''\"wine cycle\"'' which had multiplied the riches of its landowners and increased the desire of local settlers for emancipation from the Captaincy of Faial. The introduction of grapes to the island had occurred almost immediately with the first settlers, along with the cultivation of wheat and production of wine and olive oil (that were staples of the traditionally [[Mediterranean]] [[Roman Catholic|Christian]] culture at the time).  In the 15th and 16th Century, the vineyards had been a source of subsistence, then export, because the soils and rocky terrain had made it almost impossible to develop a viable cereal culture.  The diffusion of vineyards, that began in the 17th Century, was a consequence of the soil and the conquest of markets for Pico's ''[[verdelho]] wines''. The uniquely Piquense culture of grape growing on the ground, or in volcanic rock patches, allowed  the establishment of an industry and opened new markets for products originating in Madalena. \nIn the second half of the 17th Century, the collapse of the [[woad]] industry, which supported  many of the Azorean islands, and the decline of Iberian hegemony (Portugal was in a [[Iberian union|dynastic union]] with Spain at the time) in the North America,<ref>The decline of Spain and Portugal meant that ships were not required to stop in the Azores as often, and the government in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]] looked to other sources of income and new products to commercialize.</ref> created a syndrome of crisis on the islands. The growth in [[viticulture]] onto better quality soils allowed an improvement of the [[castes]], and a growth in the reputation and credibility of Piquense wines.  In addition, new markets in North America and Brazil improved exports, which had primarily relied on English patronage and purchases.\n\nThe growth of wine exports from Pico elevated the neighboring town of [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] to the status of municipality, since all international shipments were made from the island's sheltered port, creating a socio-economic disparity between the disenfranchised Piquense \"workers\" and the entrepreneurs/landowners from Faial. Along with a demographic growth on Madalena, this shift raised cries for the emancipation of Madalena and the island of Pico. In fact, Father [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] and Friar [[Agostinho de Montalverne]] certified that the colonists in Madalena had tripled by the 17th Century; in 1587, there were less than 3000 inhabitants and around 9000 by 1695, forcing the remodelling of the local church. Pico moved \"up the ladder\" of urban hierarchies from fifth largest centre in the Azores to fourth, behind [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], [[Terceira]] and Faial. By the middle of the 18th century the population was over 19000 inhabitants. The municipality was created on March 8, 1723.\n\nIn 1793, and between 1800\u201302, Madalena contributed to 80% of the domestic sales on the island of Pico, primarily from brands of wines to markets in the [[Americas|New World]], the [[Baltics]], [[India]] and [[Macau]]. Until the early 19th century, exports were handled from Horta, where most of the mercantile fleets would make call (owing to its superior services and sheltered bay). But, the island's growth ultimately supported the construction of a sheltered anchorage in Madalena, that would become the port.\n\nYet, as Madalena became the predominant center on the island, it was hit by the [[phylloxera]] plague, which destroyed many of the vineyards and began a period of economic deprivation. A diversification of economic activities was the only way to resolve these problems and improve the situation. The fruit industry, and in particular the citrus orchards, became an important staple in the ports of Horta and Madalena. Whaling also developed, but it had its most profound effects in the communities that circled the island, yet not within the jurisdiction of Madalena.\n\nIn the 20th Century, the dairy industry continued the [[boom and bust]] cycle, while [[ecotourism]] centered on [[Mount Pico|Pico]] and the histo-cultural nature of the island developed after European integration.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe municipality comprises the following six parishes:\n* [[Bandeiras (Azores)|Bandeiras]] - A village connected with the prosperity of the \"wine cycle\" of the 18th and 19th centuries; principal areas of note: Cais do Mourato and Cachorro, both \"resort towns\", and where the latter is the location of a chapel known for a traditional penitential pilgrimage; and Cabe\u00e7o Chao an area with a micro-climate.\n* [[Candel\u00e1ria (Madalena)|Candel\u00e1ria]] - A civil parish in an area of vineyards and orchards, birthplace of the late cardinal, Jose da Costa Nunes.\n* [[Cria\u00e7\u00e3o Velha]] - As its name in Portuguese means, the area of relatively older history, is still considered the true home of ''verdelho wine'', where golden grapes ripen on large beds of lava, generally in the area of Lagido.\n* [[Madalena (Madalena)|Madalena]] - The trading and communications centre of the island; its position facing the great island of [[Faial Island|Faial]] (and the town of Horta) has made it, since its original settlement, the main port to ensure links with the neighbouring islands. It is bordered by the two islets that have (along with Mount Pico itself) been characteristic of the island of Pico: ''Ilh\u00e9u Deitado'' (\"Lying Down Islet\") and ''Ilh\u00e9u em Pe'' (\"Standing Islet\"). The area of Areia Larga is considered the summer resort of the settlement, location of the oldest manor-houses associated with the \"wine cycle\". The water inside the harbor in a place called Areia Funda is dirty and you shouldn't bathe in it, better places for swimming in the summer are found in Sao Roque and lages, if you must go swimming in Madalena the best place for it is piscina municipal.\n* [[S\u00e3o Caetano (Madalena)|S\u00e3o Caetano]] - Still referred to as ''Prainha do Sul'' (\"Little Southern Beach\") or ''Prainha do Galeao'' (\"Little Beach of the Galleon\", because of the ship built there by Garcia Gon\u00e7alves Madruga in the 16th Century in order to pay debts owed to King Jo\u00e3o III), it includes the hamlet of Terra do Pao, and its small church dedicated to Saint Margaret.\n* [[S\u00e3o Mateus (Madalena)|S\u00e3o Mateus]] - One of the oldest villages on the island, it was founded in 1482, as an alternative to the port of Madalena (connecting Pico with Faial), and as a base for whaling.

It is encircled almost entirely by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] except in the east, where it is bordered by S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (Lajes do Pico) in the southeast, and Santo Ant\u00f3nio (S\u00e3o Roque do Pico) in the northeast.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:phylloxera cartoon.png|thumb|200px|left|''The phylloxera, a true gourmet, responsible for the destruction of the vineyards in the 19th Century''<br>(Cartoon from [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]], September 6, 1890)]]\nThe settlement of the island of Pico occurred much later than most islands, partly due to greater interest shown in the other islands of the Central Group.  For a time, only small herds, deposited by property-owners from Faial and [[Terceira]], along with their caretakers (some of whom were slaves), were the only inhabitants of the island.  It was not until the [[Infanta]] [[Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu|Beatriz]] proceeded to reorganize island administration and promote a greater colonization of the islands of the Central Group (between 1470 and 1480) that this changed. In 1483, Faial and Pico were integrated into one [[Captaincy]], under the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] [[Josse van Huerter]], and settlers were encouraged to colonize the island of Pico.  But even still, the area of Madalena, with its rocky coastal plain, did not attract many new settlers and the community did not expand significantly until the municipality was created in 1723.\n\nBy the first quarter of the 18th century, the municipality of Madalena was already entrenched in the ''\"wine cycle\"'' which had multiplied the riches of its landowners and increased the desire of local settlers for emancipation from the Captaincy of Faial. The introduction of grapes to the island had occurred almost immediately with the first settlers, along with the cultivation of wheat and production of wine and olive oil (that were staples of the traditionally [[Mediterranean]] [[Roman Catholic|Christian]] culture at the time).  In the 15th and 16th Century, the vineyards had been a source of subsistence, then export, because the soils and rocky terrain had made it almost impossible to develop a viable cereal culture.  The diffusion of vineyards, that began in the 17th Century, was a consequence of the soil and the conquest of markets for Pico's ''[[verdelho]] wines''. The uniquely Piquense culture of grape growing on the ground, or in volcanic rock patches, allowed  the establishment of an industry and opened new markets for products originating in Madalena. \nIn the second half of the 17th Century, the collapse of the [[woad]] industry, which supported  many of the Azorean islands, and the decline of Iberian hegemony (Portugal was in a [[Iberian union|dynastic union]] with Spain at the time) in the North America,<ref>The decline of Spain and Portugal meant that ships were not required to stop in the Azores as often, and the government in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]] looked to other sources of income and new products to commercialize.</ref> created a syndrome of crisis on the islands. The growth in [[viticulture]] onto better quality soils allowed an improvement of the [[castes]], and a growth in the reputation and credibility of Piquense wines.  In addition, new markets in North America and Brazil improved exports, which had primarily relied on English patronage and purchases.\n\nThe growth of wine exports from Pico elevated the neighboring town of [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] to the status of municipality, since all international shipments were made from the island's sheltered port, creating a socio-economic disparity between the disenfranchised Piquense \"workers\" and the entrepreneurs/landowners from Faial. Along with a demographic growth on Madalena, this shift raised cries for the emancipation of Madalena and the island of Pico. In fact, Father [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] and Friar [[Agostinho de Montalverne]] certified that the colonists in Madalena had tripled by the 17th Century; in 1587, there were less than 3000 inhabitants and around 9000 by 1695, forcing the remodelling of the local church. Pico moved \"up the ladder\" of urban hierarchies from fifth largest centre in the Azores to fourth, behind [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], [[Terceira]] and Faial. By the middle of the 18th century the population was over 19000 inhabitants. The municipality was created on March 8, 1723.\n\nIn 1793, and between 1800\u201302, Madalena contributed to 80% of the domestic sales on the island of Pico, primarily from brands of wines to markets in the [[Americas|New World]], the [[Baltics]], [[India]] and [[Macau]]. Until the early 19th century, exports were handled from Horta, where most of the mercantile fleets would make call (owing to its superior services and sheltered bay). But, the island's growth ultimately supported the construction of a sheltered anchorage in Madalena, that would become the port. \n\nYet, as Madalena became the predominant center on the island, it was hit by the [[phylloxera]] plague, which destroyed many of the vineyards and began a period of economic deprivation. A diversification of economic activities was the only way to resolve these problems and improve the situation. The fruit industry, and in particular the citrus orchards, became an important staple in the ports of Horta and Madalena. Whaling also developed, but it had its most profound effects in the communities that circled the island, yet not within the jurisdiction of Madalena. \n\nIn the 20th Century, the dairy industry continued the [[boom and bust]] cycle, while [[ecotourism]] centered on [[Mount Pico|Pico]] and the histo-cultural nature of the island developed after European integration.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe municipality comprises the following six parishes:\n* [[Bandeiras (Azores)|Bandeiras]] - A village connected with the prosperity of the \"wine cycle\" of the 18th and 19th centuries; principal areas of note: Cais do Mourato and Cachorro, both \"resort towns\", and where the latter is the location of a chapel known for a traditional penitential pilgrimage; and Cabe\u00e7o Chao an area with a micro-climate.\n* [[Candel\u00e1ria (Madalena)|Candel\u00e1ria]] - A civil parish in an area of vineyards and orchards, birthplace of the late cardinal, Jose da Costa Nunes.\n* [[Cria\u00e7\u00e3o Velha]] - As its name in Portuguese means, the area of relatively older history, is still considered the true home of ''verdelho wine'', where golden grapes ripen on large beds of lava, generally in the area of Lagido.\n* [[Madalena (Madalena)|Madalena]] - The trading and communications centre of the island; its position facing the great island of [[Faial Island|Faial]] (and the town of Horta) has made it, since its original settlement, the main port to ensure links with the neighbouring islands. It is bordered by the two islets that have (along with Mount Pico itself) been characteristic of the island of Pico: ''Ilh\u00e9u Deitado'' (\"Lying Down Islet\") and ''Ilh\u00e9u em Pe'' (\"Standing Islet\"). The area of Areia Larga is considered the summer resort of the settlement, location of the oldest manor-houses associated with the \"wine cycle\". The water inside the harbor in a place called Areia Funda is dirty and you shouldn't bathe in it, better places for swimming in the summer are found in Sao Roque and lages, if you must go swimming in Madalena the best place for it is piscina municipal.\n* [[S\u00e3o Caetano (Madalena)|S\u00e3o Caetano]] - Still referred to as ''Prainha do Sul'' (\"Little Southern Beach\") or ''Prainha do Galeao'' (\"Little Beach of the Galleon\", because of the ship built there by Garcia Gon\u00e7alves Madruga in the 16th Century in order to pay debts owed to King Jo\u00e3o III), it includes the hamlet of Terra do Pao, and its small church dedicated to Saint Margaret.\n* [[S\u00e3o Mateus (Madalena)|S\u00e3o Mateus]] - One of the oldest villages on the island, it was founded in 1482, as an alternative to the port of Madalena (connecting Pico with Faial), and as a base for whaling.

He was popularly known as '''Guruji''' (Master Teacher) and '''Pahalwanji''' (Wrestler in Hindi) by his close friends and disciples.\n\nGuruji's dedication and persistent efforts inspired his close friends and disciples to support the holy mission of building a safe [[ghat]] for people to worship in the river [[Ganges]] and offer prayers at the nearby temples.

Traditional Indian wrestling is not just a sport - it is an ancient subculture where wrestlers live and train together and follow strict rules on everything from what they can eat to what they can do in their spare time. Drinking and smoking are off limits. The focus is on living a pure life, building strength and honing their wrestling skills.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\nGuruji was from the small village Bambu near the village [[Sandwa]] in [[Churu district]] of [[Rajasthan]], India. Due to his good physique and height of 6 feet and 3&nbsp;inches, he was encouraged to study [[Pehlwani]], an Indian style of wrestling, in the milked sand wrestling pits of India called akhara. He was a favorite in most wrestling tournaments in India due to his big frame and amazing upper body strength. He wrestled on invitation of kings of various Indian princely states. He successfully competed against some of the greatest names in wrestling history and professional wrestlers from the United States.\n\nDuring the primer of his professional career, Guruji won many wrestling contests in greater India, traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal and Rangoon, Burma to wrestle against his contemporary renowned European wrestlers.  He was one of the top wrestlers in Shri Ganga Singhji's (then king of Bikaner) kingdom in Bikaner, Rajasthan, India and was conferred with numerous awards.  During his stay in Bikaner, he founded and trained at \"Maruthi Vyayamshala\", a local gymnasium. He led the Indian wrestling team  to Burma and was victorious in the championship.  The city of Bikaner celebrated after he returned from Burma.  He was billed as one of the greatest Pehlwani wrestlers in the history of Greco-Roman wrestling.  He had some legendary battles with Stanislaus Zbyszko<ref>[[Stanislaus Zbyszko]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2018}} and Gama Pahalwan<ref>[[The Great Gama]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2018}}.  After his battles he was awarded the prestigious title of '''Hind Kesari'''.\n\nGuruji was also conferred upon the title of '''The Lion of Rajputana''' in Agra (1936 A.D) by Lady Lin-lithgow (wife of then Viceroy of India - Lord Lin-lithgow) on winning a double wrestling contest (two wrestling bouts in a day).  Guruji was also instrumental in training young wrestlers and having cordial relations with a number of \"akhadas\" (wrestling arenas) including, Bikaner, Calcutta, and several cities of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.  Guruji was instrumental in training<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/dara-singh-considered-parekh-as-guru | title=Dara Singh considered Parekh as guru | date=15 July 2012 | newspaper=The Sunday Guardian | first=Susenjit | last=Guha | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}</ref> Dara Singh, when he trained with him for a brief time in Kolkota.  He had cordial relations with [[Guru Hanuman]] and [[Dara Singh]]<ref> http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/dara-singh-considered-parekh-as-guru</ref>.\n\nHe held his wrestling and spiritual gurus (teachers) in great esteem and was always grateful to them for their advice.  His wrestling prowess has been discussed in many Indian national dailies like \"The Telegraph\" and \"The Statemaan\", published from Calcutta, \"Rajasthan Patrika\", published from Jaipur.\n\n==Diet and Workouts==\nGuruji was not only a renowned wrestler of his time, winning a number of prestigious titles but was a '''great philanthropist''' too. He firmly believed '''Shareer madhyam khalu dharma sadhanam''', meaning - '''It is through a healthy body alone that one will be able to serve God and Society'''.  His daily morning routine included: Waking up by 4 am, going to the shore of the Ganges, exercise by doing thousand repetitions (reps) of squats (baithak) and push-ups (dand).  After that he would do wrestling with other wrestlers & train the new wrestlers and swim for over an hour.  \n\nHis daily training consisted of grappling with over ten of his fellow wrestlers in the akhada. He did a minimum of One thousand baithaks (Indian word for squats) and One thousand dands (Indian word for pushups) everyday.  His purely vegetarian diet included:<br>\n\n* 4-5 litres of milk per day mixed with a pound of crushed almond paste<br>\n\n* Half litre of ghee (pasteurized butter) <br>\n\n* Two pounds of butter<br>\n\n* A healthy serving of seasonal fruits or fruit juices<br>\n\n* and other healthy ingredients to promote his digestive system and muscular health<br>\n\nHe had built such great stamina with his 3-4 hour daily workout, that many times he could swim across the Hooghly river, a distance of 0.75 Km (0.5 mile) with relative ease.  His daily regimen included an hour of swimming, wrestling with multiple wrestlers and teaching them the art of wrestling.<br>\n\n==Community service==\nAfter he retired from wrestling, he was instrumental in the establishment and development of a number of temples and community centers across India.  He was also one of the founders and the President of Pareek Samaj in Kolkata for many years.\n\nSome of the community centers founded by him include: Bara Bazar Yuvak Sangh, Calcutta - founded in 1939, Maruti Vyayam Mandir, Bikaner - founded in 1946 and Ganga Seva Samiti Ghat, Calcutta - founded in 1945.\n\nVed Mata Gayatri and Shiv Temple, Liluah, Pareek Bhavan, Calcutta, Sita Ram Mandir/Bhavan, Sandwa, Rajasthan and Shiva Temple in Bammu, Rajasthan were some of the temples he set up.\n\nHe was a very active social worker and encouraged, personally donated large sums of money to the welfare of the poor, down-trodden and convinced the wealthy to donate to the charities and help the communities.\n\n==Guruji's family==\nGuruji died when was 95 years old, peacefully in 2006 in Calcutta after a brief illness.  He was a symbol of strength and saintliness and is revered among the people from all walks of life.  He visited all over India, the US and UK and enjoyed a great family life.  He is survived by two sons and a daughter.\n\nThough Wrestling in traditional clay pits is on the decline over the last few decades, but there are still many akharas left, thanks to dedicated people like Guruji, who worked to keep this ancient part of Indian culture alive.  The akharas and mud based wrestling were one of themes of a recent Aamir Khan based hindi movie - \"Dangal\" & Salman Khan hindi movie \"Sultan\".  People were mesmerized to re-live the ancient art of wrestling.  Thanks to his efforts, this ancient art is still alive and practiced with great vigor in many parts of India.\n\nOn Friday, 17 September 2010, a statue [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NathmalPahalwan.jpg] of Guruji was unveiled at Ganga Seva Samithi, Calcutta to commemorate his life and his achievements.  It was attended by his family, friends, a number of political leaders and social workers, who looked upon Guruji as their role model.  The statue is visited by thousands of tourists, who come to visit Calcutta.  People offer their prayers at nearby temple and offer flower garlands to Guruji.  His stories and legacy are discussed even to this day.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pehlwani]]\n* [[Catch wrestling]]\n* [[Bholu Pahalwan]]\n* [[Dara Singh]]\n* [[Professional wrestling]]\n* [[Premchand Dogra]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030113/asp/frontpage/story_1569235.asp\n* http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120713/jsp/calcutta/story_15721068.jsp#.UACAt_WwVF8\n* http://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/photo-d'actualit%C3%A9/the-ganges-wrestling-club-in-calcutta-which-was-photo-dactualit%C3%A9/87140960#the-ganges-wrestling-club-in-calcutta-which-was-founded-in-1961-by-picture-id87140960\n* An article published in Rajasthan Patrika, Bikaner, India - 7th Feb, 2020[[File:Rajasthan Patrika Hindi article - Feb 7, 2020.jpg|left|thumb]]<br />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pahalwan, Nathmal}}\n[[Category:Indian wrestlers]]\n[[Category:People from Churu district]]\n[[Category:Sport wrestlers from Kolkata]]\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2018}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:NathmalPahalwan.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Nathmal Pahalwan at Ganga Seva Samithi on the banks of ganges in Calcutta, India]]'''Nathmal Pahalwan''' also known as  '''Nathu Pahalwan''' ,'''Nathmal Pareek''' and '''Nathmal Kathotia''' (1911\u20132006) was a professional wrestler and a community activist from [[Calcutta]], [[India]].

Drinking and smoking are off limits. The focus is on living a pure life, building strength and honing their wrestling skills.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\nGuruji was from the small village Bambu near the village [[Sandwa]] in [[Churu]] District of [[Rajasthan]], India. Due to his good physique and height of 6 feet and 3&nbsp;inches, he was encouraged to study [[Pehlwani]], an Indian style of wrestling, in the milked sand wrestling pits of India called akhara. He was a favorite in most wrestling tournaments in India due to his big frame and amazing upper body strength. He wrestled on invitation of kings of various Indian princely states. He successfully competed against some of the greatest names in wrestling history and professional wrestlers from the United States.\n\nDuring the primer of his professional career, Guruji won many wrestling contests in greater India, traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal and Rangoon, Burma to wrestle against his contemporary renowned European wrestlers.  He was one of the top wrestlers in Shri Ganga Singhji's (then king of Bikaner) kingdom in Bikaner, Rajasthan, India and was conferred with numerous awards.  During his stay in Bikaner, he founded and trained at \"Maruthi Vyayamshala\", a local gymnasium. He led the Indian wrestling team  to Burma and was victorious in the championship.  The city of Bikaner celebrated after he returned from Burma.  He was billed as one of the greatest Pehlwani wrestlers in the history of Greco-Roman wrestling.  He had some legendary battles with Stanislaus Zbyszko<ref>[[Stanislaus Zbyszko]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2018}} and Gama Pahalwan<ref>[[The Great Gama]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2018}}.  After his battles he was awarded the prestigious title of '''Hind Kesari'''.\n\nGuruji was also conferred upon the title of '''The Lion of Rajputana''' in Agra (1936 A.D) by Lady Lin-lithgow (wife of then Viceroy of India - Lord Lin-lithgow) on winning a double wrestling contest (two wrestling bouts in a day).  Guruji was also instrumental in training young wrestlers and having cordial relations with a number of \"akhadas\" (wrestling arenas) including, Bikaner, Calcutta, and several cities of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.  Guruji was instrumental in training<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/dara-singh-considered-parekh-as-guru | title=Dara Singh considered Parekh as guru | date=15 July 2012 | newspaper=The Sunday Guardian | first=Susenjit | last=Guha | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}</ref> Dara Singh, when he trained with him for a brief time in Kolkota.  He had cordial relations with [[Guru Hanuman]] and [[Dara Singh]]<ref> http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/dara-singh-considered-parekh-as-guru</ref>.\n\nHe held his wrestling and spiritual gurus (teachers) in great esteem and was always grateful to them for their advice.  His wrestling prowess has been discussed in many Indian national dailies like \"The Telegraph\" and \"The Statemaan\", published from Calcutta, \"Rajasthan Patrika\", published from Jaipur.\n\n==Diet and Workouts==\nGuruji was not only a renowned wrestler of his time, winning a number of prestigious titles but was a '''great philanthropist''' too. He firmly believed '''Shareer madhyam khalu dharma sadhanam''', meaning - '''It is through a healthy body alone that one will be able to serve God and Society'''.  His daily morning routine included: Waking up by 4 am, going to the shore of the Ganges, exercise by doing thousand repetitions (reps) of squats (baithak) and push-ups (dand).  After that he would do wrestling with other wrestlers & train the new wrestlers and swim for over an hour.  \n\nHis daily training consisted of grappling with over ten of his fellow wrestlers in the akhada. He did a minimum of One thousand baithaks (Indian word for squats) and One thousand dands (Indian word for pushups) everyday.  His purely vegetarian diet included:<br>\n\n* 4-5 litres of milk per day mixed with a pound of crushed almond paste<br>\n\n* Half litre of ghee (pasteurized butter) <br>\n\n* Two pounds of butter<br>\n\n* A healthy serving of seasonal fruits or fruit juices<br>\n\n* and other healthy ingredients to promote his digestive system and muscular health<br>\n\nHe had built such great stamina with his 3-4 hour daily workout, that many times he could swim across the Hooghly river, a distance of 0.75 Km (0.5 mile) with relative ease.  His daily regimen included an hour of swimming, wrestling with multiple wrestlers and teaching them the art of wrestling.<br>\n\n==Community service==\nAfter he retired from wrestling, he was instrumental in the establishment and development of a number of temples and community centers across India.  He was also one of the founders and the President of Pareek Samaj in Kolkata for many years.\n\nSome of the community centers founded by him include: Bara Bazar Yuvak Sangh, Calcutta - founded in 1939, Maruti Vyayam Mandir, Bikaner - founded in 1946 and Ganga Seva Samiti Ghat, Calcutta - founded in 1945.\n\nVed Mata Gayatri and Shiv Temple, Liluah, Pareek Bhavan, Calcutta, Sita Ram Mandir/Bhavan, Sandwa, Rajasthan and Shiva Temple in Bammu, Rajasthan were some of the temples he set up.\n\nHe was a very active social worker and encouraged, personally donated large sums of money to the welfare of the poor, down-trodden and convinced the wealthy to donate to the charities and help the communities.\n\n==Guruji's family==\nGuruji died when was 95 years old, peacefully in 2006 in Calcutta after a brief illness.  He was a symbol of strength and saintliness and is revered among the people from all walks of life.  He visited all over India, the US and UK and enjoyed a great family life.  He is survived by two sons and a daughter.\n\nThough Wrestling in traditional clay pits is on the decline over the last few decades, but there are still many akharas left, thanks to dedicated people like Guruji, who worked to keep this ancient part of Indian culture alive.  The akharas and mud based wrestling were one of themes of a recent Aamir Khan based hindi movie - \"Dangal\" & Salman Khan hindi movie \"Sultan\".  People were mesmerized to re-live the ancient art of wrestling.  Thanks to his efforts, this ancient art is still alive and practiced with great vigor in many parts of India.\n\nOn Friday, 17 September 2010, a statue [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NathmalPahalwan.jpg] of Guruji was unveiled at Ganga Seva Samithi, Calcutta to commemorate his life and his achievements.  It was attended by his family, friends, a number of political leaders and social workers, who looked upon Guruji as their role model.  The statue is visited by thousands of tourists, who come to visit Calcutta.  People offer their prayers at nearby temple and offer flower garlands to Guruji.  His stories and legacy are discussed even to this day.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pehlwani]]\n* [[Catch wrestling]]\n* [[Bholu Pahalwan]]\n* [[Dara Singh]]\n* [[Professional wrestling]]\n* [[Premchand Dogra]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030113/asp/frontpage/story_1569235.asp\n* http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120713/jsp/calcutta/story_15721068.jsp#.UACAt_WwVF8\n* http://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/photo-d'actualit%C3%A9/the-ganges-wrestling-club-in-calcutta-which-was-photo-dactualit%C3%A9/87140960#the-ganges-wrestling-club-in-calcutta-which-was-founded-in-1961-by-picture-id87140960\n* An article published in Rajasthan Patrika, Bikaner, India - 7th Feb, 2020[[File:Rajasthan Patrika Hindi article - Feb 7, 2020.jpg|left|thumb]]<br />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pahalwan, Nathmal}}\n[[Category:Indian wrestlers]]\n[[Category:People from Churu district]]\n[[Category:Sport wrestlers from Kolkata]]\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Paradoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathmal_Pahalwan"}
