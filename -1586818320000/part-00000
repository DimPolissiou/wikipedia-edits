Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[Wyoming]] was won by incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas]]) with 39.70 percent of the popular vote over Governor [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas]]) with 34.10 percent. Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 25.65 percent of the popular vote.<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush. This election was the closest result Wyoming had had in presidential election history, since [[1948 United States presidential election in Wyoming|1948]], when it narrowly voted for [[Harry S. Truman]] over [[Thomas E. Dewey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election in Wyoming|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last election in which [[Natrona County, Wyoming|Natrona County]] and [[Carbon County, Wyoming|Carbon County]] voted for the Democratic candidate.<ref name=\"how\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> It was also the first time any Wyoming county had voted for a Democrat since [[Jimmy Carter]] won [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]] in [[1976 United States presidential election in Wyoming|1976]], and the first time [[Teton County, Wyoming|Teton County]] voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since it voted for [[Franklin D.

Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[Wyoming]] was won by incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas]]) with 39.70 percent of the popular vote over Governor [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas]]) with 34.10 percent. Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 25.65 percent of the popular vote.<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush. This election was the closest result Wyoming had had in presidential election history, since [[1948 United States presidential election in Wyoming|1948]], when it narrowly voted for [[Harry S. Truman]] over [[Thomas E. Dewey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election in Wyoming|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last election in which [[Natrona County, Wyoming|Natrona County]] and [[Carbon County, Wyoming|Carbon County]] voted for the Democratic candidate.<ref name=\"how\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> It was also the first time any Wyoming county had voted for a Democrat since [[Jimmy Carter]] won [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]] in [[1976 United States presidential election in Wyoming|1976]], and the first time [[Teton County, Wyoming|Teton County]] voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since it voted for [[Franklin D.

They also assist in avoiding [[Roadkill|collisions between vehicles and animals]], which in addition to killing or injuring wildlife may cause injury to humans and [[property damage]].\n\nSimilar structures can be used for domesticated animals, such as [[cattle creep]]s.\n\n== Roads and habitat fragmentation==\n[[File:Camels crossing.JPG|thumb|Camel Crossing in [[Kuwait]]]]\n[[Habitat fragmentation]] occurs when human-made barriers such as [[road ecology|road]]s, [[railroad ecology|railroad]]s, [[canal]]s, [[Electric power transmission|electric power lines]], and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] penetrate and divide wildlife habitat {{harv|Primack|2006}}. Of these, roads have the most widespread and detrimental effects {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}. Scientists estimate that the system of roads in the [[United States]] affects the ecology of at least one-fifth of the land area of the country {{harv|Forman|2000}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Forman|first=Richard T. T.|date=2000-02-01|title=Estimate of the Area Affected Ecologically by the Road System in the United States|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=31\u201335|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99299.x|issn=1523-1739}}</ref> For many years ecologists and conservationists have documented the adverse relationship between roads and wildlife. {{harvtxt|Jaeger et al.|2005}} identify four ways that roads and traffic detrimentally affect wildlife populations: (1) they decrease habitat amount and quality, (2) they increase mortality due to [[wildlife-vehicle collisions]] (road kill), (3) they prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and (4) they subdivide wildlife populations into smaller and more vulnerable sub-populations (fragmentation). Habitat fragmentation can lead to extinction or extirpation if a population's gene pool is restricted enough.\n\nThe first three effects (loss of habitat, road kill, and isolation from resources) exert pressure on various animal populations by reducing available resources and directly killing individuals in a population. For instance, {{harvtxt|Bennett|1991}} found that road kills do not pose a significant threat to healthy populations but can be devastating to small, shrinking, or threatened populations.  Road mortality has significantly affected a number of prominent species in the United States, including [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[Florida panther]]s (''Puma concolor coryi''), and [[American black bear|black bears]] (''Ursus americanus'') {{harv|Clevenger et al.|2001}}.  In addition, habitat loss can be direct, if habitat is destroyed to make room for a road, or indirect, if habitat quality close to roads is compromised due to emissions from the roads (e.g. noise, light, runoff, pollution, etc.) {{harv|Jaeger et al.|2005}}.  Finally, species that are unable to migrate across roads to reach resources such as food, shelter and mates will experience reduced reproductive and survival rates, which can compromise population viability (Noss et al., 1996).\n\nIn addition to the first three factors, numerous studies have shown that the construction and use of roads is a direct source of habitat fragmentation {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}.  As mentioned above, populations surrounded by roads are less likely to receive immigrants from other habitats and as a result, they suffer from a lack of [[genetic diversity]].  These small populations are particularly vulnerable to [[extinction]] due to demographic, genetic, and environmental [[stochasticity]] because they do not contain enough [[alleles]] to adapt to new selective pressures such as changes in temperature, habitat, and food availability {{harv|Primack|2006}}.\n\nThe relationship between roads and habitat fragmentation is well documented.  One study found that roads contribute more to fragmentation in forest habitats than clear cuts {{harv|Reed et al.|1996}}.  Another study concluded that road fragmentation of formerly contiguous forest in eastern North America is the primary cause for the decline of forest bird species and has also significantly harmed small mammals, insects, and reptiles in the United States {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}.  After years of research, biologists agree that roads and traffic lead to habitat fragmentation, isolation and road kill, all of which combine to significantly compromise the viability of wildlife populations throughout the world.\n\n== Wildlife-vehicle collisions ==\n\nIn addition to conservation concerns, wildlife-vehicle collisions have a significant cost for human populations because collisions damage property and injure and kill passengers and drivers.  {{harvtxt|Bruinderink|Hazebroek|1996}} estimated the number of collisions with [[ungulate]]s in traffic in Europe at 507,000 per year, resulting in 300 people killed, 30,000 injured,<ref name=\"conover\">{{cite journal |last1=Conover |first1=M.

Of the currently available options, structures known as wildlife crossings have been the most successful at reducing both habitat fragmentation and wildlife-vehicle collisions caused by roads ({{harvnb|Knapp|Yi|Oakasa|Thimm|2004}}, Clevenger, 2006).\n[[File:Animals bridge flathead reservation.JPG|thumb|right|\"Animals' Bridge,\" on the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]] in Montana, used by grizzly and black bears, deer, elk, mountain lions, and others<ref>\n{{Cite news \n| last = Devlin\n| first = Vince\n| title = Cameras show wildlife use Highway 93 North overpass and tunnels\n| journal = The Missoulian\n| location = Missoula, MT\n| publisher = missoulian.com\n| date = 3 October 2010\n| url = http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/article_c2e10564-cea6-11df-9944-001cc4c002e0.html\n| accessdate = 28 February 2011}}\n</ref>]]\nWildlife crossings are structural passages beneath or above roadways that are designed to facilitate safe wildlife movement across roadways {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.  In recent years, conservation biologists and wildlife managers have advocated wildlife crossings coupled with roadside fencing as a way to increase road permeability and habitat connectivity while decreasing wildlife-vehicle collisions.  Wildlife crossing is the umbrella term encompassing underpasses, overpasses, ecoducts, green bridges, amphibian/small mammal tunnels, and wildlife viaducts {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  All of these structures are designed to provide semi-natural corridors above and below roads so that animals can safely cross without endangering themselves and motorists.\n\n==History and location==\nWritten reports of rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.<ref>Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833\u20131950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 45</ref> In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in [[Rhode Island]], United States, on the [[Pawtuxet Village|Pawtuxet Falls]] Dam. As the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.<ref>Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctBsJJ0oKHEC&pg=PA9&dq=%22Fish+passage+technologies%22&hl=en&ei=WPVWTaHnGtOdcZb1oe8M&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities''] Diana Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4289-2016-1}}.</ref>\n\nThe first overland wildlife crossings were constructed in France during the 1950s {{harv|Chilson|2003}}. European countries including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and France have been using various crossing structures to reduce the conflict between wildlife and roads for several decades and use a variety of overpasses and underpasses to protect  and re-establish [[wildlife]] such as: amphibians, badgers, ungulates, invertebrates, and other small mammals {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.<ref name=\"HS\"/>\n\nThe [[Humane Society of the United States]] reports that the more than 600 tunnels installed under major and minor roads in the [[Netherlands]] have helped to substantially increase population levels of the endangered [[European badger]].<ref name=\"HS\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220358/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/issues_facing_wildlife/wildlife_crossings_wild_animals_and_roads/index.html Wildlife crossings - Wild animals and roads], [[The Humane Society of the United States]].

Torras causeway at [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], USA (2015)]]\nWildlife crossings are becoming increasingly common in [[Canada]] and the United States. Recognizable wildlife crossings are found in [[Banff National Park]] in [[Alberta]], where vegetated overpasses provide safe passage over the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] for bears, moose, deer, wolves, elk, and many other species {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}.  The 24 wildlife crossings in Banff were constructed as part of a road improvement project in 1978 {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}. In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses.  These have been used to protect [[mountain goat]]s in Montana, [[spotted salamander]]s in Massachusetts, [[bighorn sheep]] in Colorado, [[desert tortoise]]s in [[California]], and endangered [[Florida panther]]s in [[Florida]] {{harv|Chilson|2003}}.\n\nThe first wildlife crossing in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] was built in 2010, along [[Ontario Highway 69]] between [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Killarney, Ontario|Killarney]], as part of the route's ongoing freeway conversion.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/story/2012/03/20/sby-wildlife-overpass.html \"Ontario builds first bridge for animals near Sudbury\"]. [[CBC News]], March 20, 2012.</ref>\n\n== Costs and benefits ==\nThe benefits derived from constructing wildlife crossings to extend wildlife migration corridors over and under major roads appear to outweigh the costs of construction and maintenance.  One study estimates that adding wildlife crossings to a road project is a 7-8% increase in the total cost of the project {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  Theoretically, the monetary costs associated with constructing and maintaining wildlife crossings in ecologically important areas are trumped by the benefits associated with protecting wildlife populations, reducing property damage to vehicles, and saving the lives of drivers and passengers by reducing the number of collisions caused by wildlife.\n\nA study completed for the Virginia Department of Transportation estimated that underpasses for wildlife become cost effective, in terms of property damage, when they prevent between 2.6 and 9.2 deer-vehicle collisions per year, depending on the cost of the underpass.  Approximately 300 deer crossed through the underpasses in the year the study took place {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\n\nA number of studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of [[wildlife corridor]]s at providing habitat connectivity (by providing viable migration corridors) and reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions.  The effectiveness of these structures appears to be highly site-specific (due to differences in location, structure, species, habitat, etc.) but crossings have been beneficial to a number of species in a variety of locations.  Some of the wildlife crossing success stories are detailed below.\n\n=== Banff National Park ===\n\nBanff National Park offers one of the best opportunities to study the effectiveness of wildlife crossings because the park contains a wide variety of species and is bisected by a large commercial road called the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] (TCH).  To reduce the effects of the four-lane TCH, 24 wildlife crossings (22 underpasses and two overpasses) were built to ensure habitat connectivity and protect motorists {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}.  In 1996, [[Parks Canada]] developed a contract with university researchers to assess the effectiveness of the crossings.  The past decade has produced a number of publications that analyze the crossings' effect on various species and overall wildlife mortality (see {{harvnb|Clevenger|Waltho|2000}}, {{harvnb|Clevenger et al.|2001}}, and {{harvnb|Clevenger|2007}}).\n\n[[File:Wildlife overpass Trans-Canada Hwy between Banff and LakeLouise Alberta.jpg|thumb|Wildlife overpass in [[Banff National Park]], Canada]]\nUsing a variety of techniques to monitor the crossings over the last 25 years, scientists report that 10 species of large mammals (including deer, elk, black bear, [[grizzly bear]], mountain lion, wolf, moose, and [[coyote]]) have used the 24 crossings in Banff a total of 84,000 times as of January 2007 {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}. The research also identified a \"[[learning curve]]\" such that animals need time to acclimate to the structures before they feel comfortable using them. For example, grizzly bear crossings increased from seven in 1996 to more than 100 in 2006, although the actual number of individual bears using the structures remained constant over this time at between 2 and 4 bears (Parks Canada, unpublished results). A similar set of observations was made for wolves, with crossings increasing from two to approximately 140 over the same 10-year period. However, in this case the actual number of wolves in the packs using the crossings increased dramatically, from a low of two up to a high of over 20 individuals. In continuation with these positive results, {{harvtxt|Clevenger et al.|2001}} reported that the use of wildlife crossings and fencing reduced traffic-induced mortality of large ungulates on the TCH by more than 80 percent. Recent analysis for carnivores showed results were not as positive however, with bear mortality increasing by an average of 116 percent in direct parallel to an equal doubling of traffic volumes on the highway, clearly showing no effect of fencing to reduce bear mortality (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep). Research on the crossings in Banff has thus shown mixed value of wildlife crossings depending on the species in question.\n\nParks Canada is currently planning to build 17 additional crossing structures across the TCH to increase driver safety near the hamlet of [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]]. Lack of effectiveness of standard fencing in reducing bear mortality demonstrates that additional measures such as wire 'T-caps' on the fence may be needed for fencing to mitigate effectively for bears (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).\n\n=== Collier and Lee counties in Florida ===\nTwenty-four wildlife crossings (highway underpasses) and 12 bridges modified for wildlife have been constructed along a 40-mile stretch of [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] in [[Collier County, Florida|Collier]] and [[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] counties in [[Florida]] {{harv|Scott|2007}}.  These crossings are specifically designed to target and protect the endangered Florida panther, a subspecies of mountain lion found in the [[southeastern United States]]. Scientists estimate that there are only 80-100 Florida panthers alive in the wild, making them one of the most endangered large mammals in North America (Foster and Humphrey, 1995). The Florida panther is particularly vulnerable to wildlife-vehicle collisions, which claimed 11 panthers in 2006 and 14 panthers in 2007 {{harv|Scott|2007}}.\n\nThe [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]] (FWC) has used a number of mitigation tools in an effort to protect Florida panthers and the combination of wildlife crossings and fences have proven the most effective {{harv|Scott|2007}}.  As of 2007, no panthers have been killed in areas equipped with continuous fencing and wildlife crossings and the FWC is planning to construct many more crossing structures in the future.  The underpasses on I-75 also appeared to benefit bobcats, deer, and raccoons and significantly reduced wildlife-vehicle collisions along the interstate (Foster and Humphrey, 1995).\n\n=== Underpasses in southern California ===\nWildlife crossings have also been important for protecting [[biodiversity]] in several areas of [[southern California]].  In [[San Bernardino County]], biologists have erected fences along [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]] to complement underpasses (culverts) that are being used by the threatened [[desert tortoise]].  Tortoise deaths on the highway declined by 93% during the first four years after the introduction of the fences, proving that even makeshift wildlife crossings (storm-drainage culverts in this case) have the ability to increase highway permeability and protect sensitive species {{harv|Chilson|2003}}.  Additionally, studies by {{harvtxt|Haas|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Lyren|2001}} report that underpasses in Orange, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties have drawn significant use from a variety of species including [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[gray fox]], [[mule deer]], and [[long-tailed weasel]]s.  These results could be extremely important for wildlife conservation efforts in the region's [[Puente Hills]] and [[Chino Hills]] links, which have been increasingly fragmented by road construction {{harv|Haas|2000}}. [http://www.habitatauthority.org/harbor-boulevard-wildlife-underpass/ Los Angeles County's first wildlife-purpose built underpass is at Harbor Boulevard].  It was built in partnership between Los Angeles County, California State Parks and the Puente Hills Habitat Preservation Authority.\n\n=== Ecoducts, Netherlands ===\n[[Image:Cerviduct.jpg|thumb|One of the two wildlife crossings spanning the A50 highway on the Veluwe in the Netherlands]]\nThe Netherlands has over 66 wildlife crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) that have been used to protect the endangered [[European badger]],<ref>[http://www.mjpo.nl/nieuws-publicaties/publicaties/ MJPO annual report 2014]</ref> as well as populations of [[wild boar]], [[red deer]], and [[roe deer]].  As of 2012, the [[Veluwe]], 1000 square kilometers of woods, heathland and drifting sands, the largest lowland nature area in North Western Europe, contains nine ecoducts, 50 meters wide on average,  that are used to shuttle wildlife across highways that transect the Veluwe.  The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the [[A50 motorway (Netherlands)|A50]] when the highway was constructed. Five of the other ecoducts on the Veluwe were built across existing highways, one was built across a two lane provincial road. The two ecoducts across the A50 were used by nearly 5,000 deer and wild boar during a one-year period {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  The Netherlands also boasts the world's longest ecoduct-wildlife overpass called the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo (sand quarry nature bridge at Crailo) {{harv|Danby|2004}}.  The massive structure, completed in 2006, is 50 m wide and over 800 m long and spans a railway line, [[business park]], river, roadway, and sports complex {{harv|Danby|2004}}.  Monitoring is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of this innovative project combining wildlife protection with urban development. The oldest wildlife passage is Zeist West - A 28, opened in 1988.\n\n=== Slaty Creek Wildlife Underpass, Calder Freeway, Black Forest, Australia ===\nAnother case study of the effectiveness of wildlife crossings comes from an underpass built to minimize the ecological effect of the [[Calder Freeway]] as it travels through the Black Forest in Victoria, Australia.  In 1997, the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]] Roads Corporation built Slaty Creek wildlife underpass at a cost of $3 million {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.  Scientists used 14 different techniques to monitor the underpass for 12 months in order to determine the abundance and diversity of species using the underpass {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.  During the 12-month period, 79 species of fauna were detected in the underpass (compared with 116 species detected in the surrounding forest) including amphibians, [[bat]]s, birds, [[koala]]s, [[wombat]]s, [[Gliding possum|gliders]], reptiles, and [[kangaroo]]s {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.   The results indicate that the underpass could be useful to a wide array of species but the authors suggest that Slaty Creek could be improved by enhanced design and maintenance of fencing to minimise road kill along the Calder Freeway and by attempting to exclude introduced predators such as cats and foxes from the area.\n\n==The ARC International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition==\nIn 2010, ARC Solutions - an interdisciplinary partnership - initiated the International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition for a wildlife crossing over [[Interstate 70]] near Denver, Colorado.,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/wildlife_and_highways_new_ideas_sought_for_colorados_berlin_wall/C41/L41/ | title=Wildlife and Highways: New Ideas Sought for Colorado's 'Berlin Wall' | author=Allen Best | date=November 1, 2010 | publisher=New West|  accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref> and designers had to account for many challenges unique to the area, including snow and severe weather, high elevation and steep grades, a six-lane roadway, a bike path, and high traffic volumes, as well as multiple species of wildlife, including lynx.\n\nAfter receiving 36 submissions from nine countries, a jury of internationally acclaimed experts in landscape architecture, engineering, architecture, ecology and transportation selected five finalists in November 2010 to further develop their conceptual designs for a wildlife crossing structure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://competition.arc-solutions.org/finalists.php | title=Finalists | publisher=Arc | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}</ref>  In January 2011, the team led by HNTB with Michael Van Valkenburgh & Associates (New York)  were selected as the winners.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://competition.arc-solutions.org/video.php | title=ARC International Wildlife Crossing Design Competition | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}</ref>  The design features a single 100&nbsp;m (328&nbsp;ft) concrete span across the highway that is planted with a variety of vegetation types, including a pine-tree forest and meadow grasses, to attract different species to cross.

Thanks to the efforts of NGOs and the forest department, several canopy bridges were installed, connecting trees on either side of the road.

They also assist in avoiding [[Roadkill|collisions between vehicles and animals]], which in addition to killing or injuring wildlife may cause injury to humans and [[property damage]].\n\nSimilar structures can be used for domesticated animals, such as [[cattle creep]]s.\n\n== Roads and habitat fragmentation==\n[[File:Camels crossing.JPG|thumb|Camel Crossing in [[Kuwait]]]]\n[[Habitat fragmentation]] occurs when human-made barriers such as [[road ecology|road]]s, [[railroad ecology|railroad]]s, [[canal]]s, [[Electric power transmission|electric power lines]], and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] penetrate and divide wildlife habitat {{harv|Primack|2006}}. Of these, roads have the most widespread and detrimental effects {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}. Scientists estimate that the system of roads in the [[United States]] affects the ecology of at least one-fifth of the land area of the country {{harv|Forman|2000}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Forman|first=Richard T. T.|date=2000-02-01|title=Estimate of the Area Affected Ecologically by the Road System in the United States|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=31\u201335|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99299.x|issn=1523-1739}}</ref> For many years ecologists and conservationists have documented the adverse relationship between roads and wildlife. {{harvtxt|Jaeger et al.|2005}} identify four ways that roads and traffic detrimentally affect wildlife populations: (1) they decrease habitat amount and quality, (2) they increase mortality due to [[wildlife-vehicle collisions]] (road kill), (3) they prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and (4) they subdivide wildlife populations into smaller and more vulnerable sub-populations (fragmentation). Habitat fragmentation can lead to extinction or extirpation if a population's gene pool is restricted enough.\n\nThe first three effects (loss of habitat, road kill, and isolation from resources) exert pressure on various animal populations by reducing available resources and directly killing individuals in a population. For instance, {{harvtxt|Bennett|1991}} found that road kills do not pose a significant threat to healthy populations but can be devastating to small, shrinking, or threatened populations.  Road mortality has significantly affected a number of prominent species in the United States, including [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[Florida panther]]s (''Puma concolor coryi''), and [[American black bear|black bears]] (''Ursus americanus'') {{harv|Clevenger et al.|2001}}.  In addition, habitat loss can be direct, if habitat is destroyed to make room for a road, or indirect, if habitat quality close to roads is compromised due to emissions from the roads (e.g. noise, light, runoff, pollution, etc.) {{harv|Jaeger et al.|2005}}.  Finally, species that are unable to migrate across roads to reach resources such as food, shelter and mates will experience reduced reproductive and survival rates, which can compromise population viability (Noss et al., 1996).\n\nIn addition to the first three factors, numerous studies have shown that the construction and use of roads is a direct source of habitat fragmentation {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}.  As mentioned above, populations surrounded by roads are less likely to receive immigrants from other habitats and as a result, they suffer from a lack of [[genetic diversity]].  These small populations are particularly vulnerable to [[extinction]] due to demographic, genetic, and environmental [[stochasticity]] because they do not contain enough [[alleles]] to adapt to new selective pressures such as changes in temperature, habitat, and food availability {{harv|Primack|2006}}.\n\nThe relationship between roads and habitat fragmentation is well documented.  One study found that roads contribute more to fragmentation in forest habitats than clear cuts {{harv|Reed et al.|1996}}.  Another study concluded that road fragmentation of formerly contiguous forest in eastern North America is the primary cause for the decline of forest bird species and has also significantly harmed small mammals, insects, and reptiles in the United States {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}.  After years of research, biologists agree that roads and traffic lead to habitat fragmentation, isolation and road kill, all of which combine to significantly compromise the viability of wildlife populations throughout the world.\n\n== Wildlife-vehicle collisions ==\n\nIn addition to conservation concerns, wildlife-vehicle collisions have a significant cost for human populations because collisions damage property and injure and kill passengers and drivers.  {{harvtxt|Bruinderink|Hazebroek|1996}} estimated the number of collisions with [[ungulate]]s in traffic in Europe at 507,000 per year, resulting in 300 people killed, 30,000 injured,<ref name=\"conover\">{{cite journal |last1=Conover |first1=M.

Of the currently available options, structures known as wildlife crossings have been the most successful at reducing both habitat fragmentation and wildlife-vehicle collisions caused by roads ({{harvnb|Knapp|Yi|Oakasa|Thimm|2004}}, Clevenger, 2006).\n[[File:Animals bridge flathead reservation.JPG|thumb|right|\"Animals' Bridge,\" on the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]] in Montana, used by grizzly and black bears, deer, elk, mountain lions, and others<ref>\n{{Cite news \n| last = Devlin\n| first = Vince\n| title = Cameras show wildlife use Highway 93 North overpass and tunnels\n| journal = The Missoulian\n| location = Missoula, MT\n| publisher = missoulian.com\n| date = 3 October 2010\n| url = http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/article_c2e10564-cea6-11df-9944-001cc4c002e0.html\n| accessdate = 28 February 2011}}\n</ref>]]\nWildlife crossings are structural passages beneath or above roadways that are designed to facilitate safe wildlife movement across roadways {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.  In recent years, conservation biologists and wildlife managers have advocated wildlife crossings coupled with roadside fencing as a way to increase road permeability and habitat connectivity while decreasing wildlife-vehicle collisions.  Wildlife crossing is the umbrella term encompassing underpasses, overpasses, ecoducts, green bridges, amphibian/small mammal tunnels, and wildlife viaducts {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  All of these structures are designed to provide semi-natural corridors above and below roads so that animals can safely cross without endangering themselves and motorists.\n\n==History and location==\nWritten reports of rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.<ref>Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833\u20131950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 45</ref> In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in [[Rhode Island]], United States, on the [[Pawtuxet Village|Pawtuxet Falls]] Dam. As the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.<ref>Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctBsJJ0oKHEC&pg=PA9&dq=%22Fish+passage+technologies%22&hl=en&ei=WPVWTaHnGtOdcZb1oe8M&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities''] Diana Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4289-2016-1}}.</ref>\n\nThe first overland wildlife crossings were constructed in France during the 1950s {{harv|Chilson|2003}}. European countries including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and France have been using various crossing structures to reduce the conflict between wildlife and roads for several decades and use a variety of overpasses and underpasses to protect  and re-establish [[wildlife]] such as: amphibians, badgers, ungulates, invertebrates, and other small mammals {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.<ref name=\"HS\"/>\n\nThe [[Humane Society of the United States]] reports that the more than 600 tunnels installed under major and minor roads in the [[Netherlands]] have helped to substantially increase population levels of the endangered [[European badger]].<ref name=\"HS\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220358/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/issues_facing_wildlife/wildlife_crossings_wild_animals_and_roads/index.html Wildlife crossings - Wild animals and roads], [[The Humane Society of the United States]].

Torras causeway at [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], USA (2015)]]\nWildlife crossings are becoming increasingly common in [[Canada]] and the United States. Recognizable wildlife crossings are found in [[Banff National Park]] in [[Alberta]], where vegetated overpasses provide safe passage over the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] for bears, moose, deer, wolves, elk, and many other species {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}.  The 24 wildlife crossings in Banff were constructed as part of a road improvement project in 1978 {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}. In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses.  These have been used to protect [[mountain goat]]s in Montana, [[spotted salamander]]s in Massachusetts, [[bighorn sheep]] in Colorado, [[desert tortoise]]s in [[California]], and endangered [[Florida panther]]s in [[Florida]] {{harv|Chilson|2003}}.\n\nThe first wildlife crossing in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] was built in 2010, along [[Ontario Highway 69]] between [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Killarney, Ontario|Killarney]], as part of the route's ongoing freeway conversion.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/story/2012/03/20/sby-wildlife-overpass.html \"Ontario builds first bridge for animals near Sudbury\"]. [[CBC News]], March 20, 2012.</ref>\n\n== Costs and benefits ==\nThe benefits derived from constructing wildlife crossings to extend wildlife migration corridors over and under major roads appear to outweigh the costs of construction and maintenance.  One study estimates that adding wildlife crossings to a road project is a 7-8% increase in the total cost of the project {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  Theoretically, the monetary costs associated with constructing and maintaining wildlife crossings in ecologically important areas are trumped by the benefits associated with protecting wildlife populations, reducing property damage to vehicles, and saving the lives of drivers and passengers by reducing the number of collisions caused by wildlife.\n\nA study completed for the Virginia Department of Transportation estimated that underpasses for wildlife become cost effective, in terms of property damage, when they prevent between 2.6 and 9.2 deer-vehicle collisions per year, depending on the cost of the underpass.  Approximately 300 deer crossed through the underpasses in the year the study took place {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\n\nA number of studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of [[wildlife corridor]]s at providing habitat connectivity (by providing viable migration corridors) and reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions.  The effectiveness of these structures appears to be highly site-specific (due to differences in location, structure, species, habitat, etc.) but crossings have been beneficial to a number of species in a variety of locations.  Some of the wildlife crossing success stories are detailed below.\n\n=== Banff National Park ===\n\nBanff National Park offers one of the best opportunities to study the effectiveness of wildlife crossings because the park contains a wide variety of species and is bisected by a large commercial road called the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] (TCH).  To reduce the effects of the four-lane TCH, 24 wildlife crossings (22 underpasses and two overpasses) were built to ensure habitat connectivity and protect motorists {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}.  In 1996, [[Parks Canada]] developed a contract with university researchers to assess the effectiveness of the crossings.  The past decade has produced a number of publications that analyze the crossings' effect on various species and overall wildlife mortality (see {{harvnb|Clevenger|Waltho|2000}}, {{harvnb|Clevenger et al.|2001}}, and {{harvnb|Clevenger|2007}}).\n\n[[File:Wildlife overpass Trans-Canada Hwy between Banff and LakeLouise Alberta.jpg|thumb|Wildlife overpass in [[Banff National Park]], Canada]]\nUsing a variety of techniques to monitor the crossings over the last 25 years, scientists report that 10 species of large mammals (including deer, elk, black bear, [[grizzly bear]], mountain lion, wolf, moose, and [[coyote]]) have used the 24 crossings in Banff a total of 84,000 times as of January 2007 {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}. The research also identified a \"[[learning curve]]\" such that animals need time to acclimate to the structures before they feel comfortable using them. For example, grizzly bear crossings increased from seven in 1996 to more than 100 in 2006, although the actual number of individual bears using the structures remained constant over this time at between 2 and 4 bears (Parks Canada, unpublished results). A similar set of observations was made for wolves, with crossings increasing from two to approximately 140 over the same 10-year period. However, in this case the actual number of wolves in the packs using the crossings increased dramatically, from a low of two up to a high of over 20 individuals. In continuation with these positive results, {{harvtxt|Clevenger et al.|2001}} reported that the use of wildlife crossings and fencing reduced traffic-induced mortality of large ungulates on the TCH by more than 80 percent. Recent analysis for carnivores showed results were not as positive however, with bear mortality increasing by an average of 116 percent in direct parallel to an equal doubling of traffic volumes on the highway, clearly showing no effect of fencing to reduce bear mortality (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep). Research on the crossings in Banff has thus shown mixed value of wildlife crossings depending on the species in question.\n\nParks Canada is currently planning to build 17 additional crossing structures across the TCH to increase driver safety near the hamlet of [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]]. Lack of effectiveness of standard fencing in reducing bear mortality demonstrates that additional measures such as wire 'T-caps' on the fence may be needed for fencing to mitigate effectively for bears (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).\n\n=== Collier and Lee counties in Florida ===\nTwenty-four wildlife crossings (highway underpasses) and 12 bridges modified for wildlife have been constructed along a 40-mile stretch of [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] in [[Collier County, Florida|Collier]] and [[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] counties in [[Florida]] {{harv|Scott|2007}}.  These crossings are specifically designed to target and protect the endangered Florida panther, a subspecies of mountain lion found in the [[southeastern United States]]. Scientists estimate that there are only 80-100 Florida panthers alive in the wild, making them one of the most endangered large mammals in North America (Foster and Humphrey, 1995). The Florida panther is particularly vulnerable to wildlife-vehicle collisions, which claimed 11 panthers in 2006 and 14 panthers in 2007 {{harv|Scott|2007}}.\n\nThe [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]] (FWC) has used a number of mitigation tools in an effort to protect Florida panthers and the combination of wildlife crossings and fences have proven the most effective {{harv|Scott|2007}}.  As of 2007, no panthers have been killed in areas equipped with continuous fencing and wildlife crossings and the FWC is planning to construct many more crossing structures in the future.  The underpasses on I-75 also appeared to benefit bobcats, deer, and raccoons and significantly reduced wildlife-vehicle collisions along the interstate (Foster and Humphrey, 1995).\n\n=== Underpasses in southern California ===\nWildlife crossings have also been important for protecting [[biodiversity]] in several areas of [[southern California]].  In [[San Bernardino County]], biologists have erected fences along [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]] to complement underpasses (culverts) that are being used by the threatened [[desert tortoise]].  Tortoise deaths on the highway declined by 93% during the first four years after the introduction of the fences, proving that even makeshift wildlife crossings (storm-drainage culverts in this case) have the ability to increase highway permeability and protect sensitive species {{harv|Chilson|2003}}.  Additionally, studies by {{harvtxt|Haas|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Lyren|2001}} report that underpasses in Orange, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties have drawn significant use from a variety of species including [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[gray fox]], [[mule deer]], and [[long-tailed weasel]]s.  These results could be extremely important for wildlife conservation efforts in the region's [[Puente Hills]] and [[Chino Hills]] links, which have been increasingly fragmented by road construction {{harv|Haas|2000}}. [http://www.habitatauthority.org/harbor-boulevard-wildlife-underpass/ Los Angeles County's first wildlife-purpose built underpass is at Harbor Boulevard].  It was built in partnership between Los Angeles County, California State Parks and the Puente Hills Habitat Preservation Authority.\n\n=== Ecoducts, Netherlands ===\n[[Image:Cerviduct.jpg|thumb|One of the two wildlife crossings spanning the A50 highway on the Veluwe in the Netherlands]]\nThe Netherlands has over 66 wildlife crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) that have been used to protect the endangered [[European badger]],<ref>[http://www.mjpo.nl/nieuws-publicaties/publicaties/ MJPO annual report 2014]</ref> as well as populations of [[wild boar]], [[red deer]], and [[roe deer]].  As of 2012, the [[Veluwe]], 1000 square kilometers of woods, heathland and drifting sands, the largest lowland nature area in North Western Europe, contains nine ecoducts, 50 meters wide on average,  that are used to shuttle wildlife across highways that transect the Veluwe.  The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the [[A50 motorway (Netherlands)|A50]] when the highway was constructed. Five of the other ecoducts on the Veluwe were built across existing highways, one was built across a two lane provincial road. The two ecoducts across the A50 were used by nearly 5,000 deer and wild boar during a one-year period {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  The Netherlands also boasts the world's longest ecoduct-wildlife overpass called the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo (sand quarry nature bridge at Crailo) {{harv|Danby|2004}}.  The massive structure, completed in 2006, is 50 m wide and over 800 m long and spans a railway line, [[business park]], river, roadway, and sports complex {{harv|Danby|2004}}.  Monitoring is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of this innovative project combining wildlife protection with urban development. The oldest wildlife passage is Zeist West - A 28, opened in 1988.\n\n=== Slaty Creek Wildlife Underpass, Calder Freeway, Black Forest, Australia ===\nAnother case study of the effectiveness of wildlife crossings comes from an underpass built to minimize the ecological effect of the [[Calder Freeway]] as it travels through the Black Forest in Victoria, Australia.  In 1997, the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]] Roads Corporation built Slaty Creek wildlife underpass at a cost of $3 million {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.  Scientists used 14 different techniques to monitor the underpass for 12 months in order to determine the abundance and diversity of species using the underpass {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.  During the 12-month period, 79 species of fauna were detected in the underpass (compared with 116 species detected in the surrounding forest) including amphibians, [[bat]]s, birds, [[koala]]s, [[wombat]]s, [[Gliding possum|gliders]], reptiles, and [[kangaroo]]s {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.   The results indicate that the underpass could be useful to a wide array of species but the authors suggest that Slaty Creek could be improved by enhanced design and maintenance of fencing to minimise road kill along the Calder Freeway and by attempting to exclude introduced predators such as cats and foxes from the area.\n\n==The ARC International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition==\nIn 2010, ARC Solutions - an interdisciplinary partnership - initiated the International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition for a wildlife crossing over [[Interstate 70]] near Denver, Colorado.,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/wildlife_and_highways_new_ideas_sought_for_colorados_berlin_wall/C41/L41/ | title=Wildlife and Highways: New Ideas Sought for Colorado's 'Berlin Wall' | author=Allen Best | date=November 1, 2010 | publisher=New West|  accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref> and designers had to account for many challenges unique to the area, including snow and severe weather, high elevation and steep grades, a six-lane roadway, a bike path, and high traffic volumes, as well as multiple species of wildlife, including lynx.\n\nAfter receiving 36 submissions from nine countries, a jury of internationally acclaimed experts in landscape architecture, engineering, architecture, ecology and transportation selected five finalists in November 2010 to further develop their conceptual designs for a wildlife crossing structure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://competition.arc-solutions.org/finalists.php | title=Finalists | publisher=Arc | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}</ref>  In January 2011, the team led by HNTB with Michael Van Valkenburgh & Associates (New York)  were selected as the winners.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://competition.arc-solutions.org/video.php | title=ARC International Wildlife Crossing Design Competition | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}</ref>  The design features a single 100&nbsp;m (328&nbsp;ft) concrete span across the highway that is planted with a variety of vegetation types, including a pine-tree forest and meadow grasses, to attract different species to cross. A modular precast concrete design means that much of the bridge can be constructed offsite and moved into place.<ref>{{cite web | title=Designing the Next Generation of Wildlife Crossings | date=March 2011 | publisher=United States Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration }}</ref>\n\n=== Canopy Bridge in Anamalai Tiger Reserve ===\nMany endangered [[lion-tailed macaques]] used to get killed while crossing the highway at Puduthotam in [[Valparai]], South India. Thanks to the efforts of NGOs and the forest department, several canopy bridges were installed, connecting trees on either side of the road. This helped to lower the numbers of lion-tailed macaques killed in the region. The [[Environment Conservation Group]] had initiated a national mission to increase awareness on the importance of adopting roadkill mitigation methods through their mission PATH<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/stop-the-animals-are-crossing/article8029760.ece | title=Stop!

She did not get the part, but he recommended her to the producers of ''[[East of Sudan]]'' (1964).\n\n==Career==\n\n===Television and film===\n[[File:Logan's Run in Dallas.jpg|thumb|200px| Agutter with [[Michael York]] on the set of ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''.]]\nAgutter came to television audiences as Kirsty in the twice-weekly BBC series ''[[The Newcomers (TV series)|The Newcomers]]''. The character Kirsty was the daughter of the new managing director of Eden Brothers, the fictional firm that was at the centre of the series. Agutter could appear only during school holidays. At this stage of her career, she was listed in credits as Jennifer. In 1968, she was featured in the lavish big-budget [[20th Century Fox]] film musical ''Star!'' with [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Gertrude Lawrence]]. In that motion picture, Agutter played Lawrence's neglected daughter Pamela. Later, she played Roberta in a BBC adaptation of ''[[The Railway Children#BBC television series|The Railway Children]]'' (1968) and played the same part in [[Lionel Jeffries]]'s [[The Railway Children (1970 film)|1970 film]] of the book. She followed this with a more serious role in the thriller ''[[I Start Counting (film)|I Start Counting]]'' (1969). She also won an Emmy as supporting actress for her television role as Fritha, in a British [[The Snow Goose (film)|television adaptation]] of ''The Snow Goose'' (1971).\n\nAgutter moved into adult roles, beginning with ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971), playing a teenaged schoolgirl lost with her younger brother in the Australian [[outback]]. She auditioned for the role in 1967, but funding problems delayed filming until 1969. The delay meant Agutter was 16 at the time of filming, which allowed the director to include [[nudity|nude scenes]].<ref name=\"Nowra (2003)\">[[Louis Nowra|Nowra, L.]] (2003). ''Walkabout''.

She did not get the part, but he recommended her to the producers of ''[[East of Sudan]]'' (1964).\n\n==Career==\n\n===Television and film===\n[[File:Logan's Run in Dallas.jpg|thumb|200px| Agutter with [[Michael York]] on the set of ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''.]]\nAgutter came to television audiences as Kirsty in the twice-weekly BBC series ''[[The Newcomers (TV series)|The Newcomers]]''. The character Kirsty was the daughter of the new managing director of Eden Brothers, the fictional firm that was at the centre of the series. Agutter could appear only during school holidays. At this stage of her career, she was listed in credits as Jennifer. In 1968, she was featured in the lavish big-budget [[20th Century Fox]] film musical ''Star!'' with [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Gertrude Lawrence]]. In that motion picture, Agutter played Lawrence's neglected daughter Pamela. Later, she played Roberta in a BBC adaptation of ''[[The Railway Children#BBC television series|The Railway Children]]'' (1968) and played the same part in [[Lionel Jeffries]]'s [[The Railway Children (1970 film)|1970 film]] of the book. She followed this with a more serious role in the thriller ''[[I Start Counting (film)|I Start Counting]]'' (1969). She also won an Emmy as supporting actress for her television role as Fritha, in a British [[The Snow Goose (film)|television adaptation]] of ''The Snow Goose'' (1971).\n\nAgutter moved into adult roles, beginning with ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971), playing a teenaged schoolgirl lost with her younger brother in the Australian [[outback]]. She auditioned for the role in 1967, but funding problems delayed filming until 1969. The delay meant Agutter was 16 at the time of filming, which allowed the director to include [[nudity|nude scenes]].<ref name=\"Nowra (2003)\">[[Louis Nowra|Nowra, L.]] (2003). ''Walkabout''.

Agutter has commented that the innocence of the characters she played in her early films, combined with the costumes and nudity in later adult roles such as ''Logan's Run'', ''Equus'', and ''An American Werewolf in London'', are \"perfect fantasy fodder\".<ref name=\"McLean (2002)\">McLean, G., 2002.

She is best known for her 2012 autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'', which tells the story of her escape from an ultra-religious community in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nFeldman grew up as a member of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar group]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].{{R|Bonos}} She was raised by her grandparents, Bubbi and Zeidy, both Holocaust survivors, since her mother had been banished by the community, and her mentally impaired father wasn't able to raise her on his own. Like all girls in the community, Feldman was raised to be pious, spoke in Yiddish, and was banned from going to the public library. She was denied a typical American education, but hid books under her bed for fear her elders would suspect her growing curiosity about the world. She entered an arranged marriage at the age of 17, and became a mother at 19.{{R|DONALDSON}}{{R|Goodreads}}\n\n==Separation from Hasidic community==\nFeldman says that the birth of her son was a turning point regarding staying in the Hasidic community: \"I saw my future all mapped out... I freaked out at the knowledge that I have the responsibility and guilt of putting everything I saw as my oppression into an innocent person.\" Feldman lied to her husband saying she wanted to take business classes so she could supplement his income, and in 2006, she and her husband moved out of Williamsburg and she began to study literature at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nOnce in school she \"made a beeline\" for a college degree to connect her with the outside world. She began to speak out and \"open my mind.\" She also began to wear jeans and high heels, breaking the strict Hasidic dress code. In 2010, she took her son, left her husband, and cut all ties with the Hasidic community.{{R|Wiener}} She lived for two months with friends, and consulted with lawyers to make sure she didn't lose custody of her son. As of 2012, Feldman had not seen or spoken to any of her family since 2006.{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nDespite her differences with the Hasidic community, Feldman has said \"I am proud of being Jewish, because I think that\u2019s where my indomitable spirit comes from.\"{{R|NYT2012}}\n\n==Career==\nFeldman started blogging and in 2012 published her autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'',{{R|hardcover}} which became a best-seller.{{R|amazon}} In 2014, Feldman moved to Berlin, where she settled in the [[Neuk\u00f6lln (locality)|Neuk\u00f6lln]] district, and continued to work as a writer.{{R|ARFA}} In 2014 she published ''Exodus: A Memoir.'' {{R|Exodus}} Her books have been translated into German, and well received by German critics, which led to her appearing on various talk shows on German TV.{{R|Wiener}}{{R|Guardian2010}}\n\nFeldman is featured in the 2018 Swiss-German documentary ''[[Female Pleasure|#Female Pleasure]]''{{R|Pleasure}} and the 2020 [[Netflix]] original miniseries ''[[Unorthodox (miniseries)|Unorthodox]]'' is loosely based on her autobiography.{{R|MAZRIA}}\n\n==Criticism==\nMembers of the Orthodox community have lashed back at Feldman, including in a blog titled \"Deborah Feldman Exposed,\" which was dedicated to \"exposing the lies and fabrications\" in her story.{{R|LEUNG}} In April 2012, [[Huffington Post]] contributor Jesse Kornbluth\nexamined this criticism in an article titled ''Unorthodox: The Hasidic Campaign Against Deborah Feldman \u2014 and Me'' which concluded \"There are claims in this book that Hasids have disputed. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s true. But I\u2019m sure of one thing: Men who can\u2019t live equally with women aren\u2019t worth living with.\"{{R|Kornbluth}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic

She is best known for her 2012 autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'', which tells the story of her escape from an ultra-religious community in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nFeldman grew up as a member of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar group]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].{{R|Bonos}} She was raised by her grandparents, Bubbi and Zeidy, both Holocaust survivors, since her mother had been banished by the community, and her mentally impaired father wasn't able to raise her on his own. Like all girls in the community, Feldman was raised to be pious, spoke in Yiddish, and was banned from going to the public library. She was denied a typical American education, but hid books under her bed for fear her elders would suspect her growing curiosity about the world. She entered an arranged marriage at the age of 17, and became a mother at 19.{{R|DONALDSON}}{{R|Goodreads}}\n\n==Separation from Hasidic community==\nFeldman says that the birth of her son was a turning point regarding staying in the Hasidic community: \"I saw my future all mapped out... I freaked out at the knowledge that I have the responsibility and guilt of putting everything I saw as my oppression into an innocent person.\" Feldman lied to her husband saying she wanted to take business classes so she could supplement his income, and in 2006, she and her husband moved out of Williamsburg and she began to study literature at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nOnce in school she \"made a beeline\" for a college degree to connect her with the outside world. She began to speak out and \"open my mind.\" She also began to wear jeans and high heels, breaking the strict Hasidic dress code. In 2010, she took her son, left her husband, and cut all ties with the Hasidic community.{{R|Wiener}} She lived for two months with friends, and consulted with lawyers to make sure she didn't lose custody of her son. As of 2012, Feldman had not seen or spoken to any of her family since 2006.{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nDespite her differences with the Hasidic community, Feldman has said \"I am proud of being Jewish, because I think that\u2019s where my indomitable spirit comes from.\"{{R|NYT2012}}\n\n==Career==\nFeldman started blogging and in 2012 published her autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'',{{R|hardcover}} which became a best-seller.{{R|amazon}} In 2014, Feldman moved to Berlin, where she settled in the [[Neuk\u00f6lln (locality)|Neuk\u00f6lln]] district, and continued to work as a writer.{{R|ARFA}} In 2014 she published ''Exodus: A Memoir.'' {{R|Exodus}} Her books have been translated into German, and well received by German critics, which led to her appearing on various talk shows on German TV.{{R|Wiener}}{{R|Guardian2010}}\n\nFeldman is featured in the 2018 Swiss-German documentary ''[[Female Pleasure|#Female Pleasure]]''{{R|Pleasure}} and the 2020 [[Netflix]] original miniseries ''[[Unorthodox (miniseries)|Unorthodox]]'' is loosely based on her autobiography.{{R|MAZRIA}}\n\n==Criticism==\nMembers of the Orthodox community have lashed back at Feldman, including in a blog titled \"Deborah Feldman Exposed,\" which was dedicated to \"exposing the lies and fabrications\" in her story.{{R|LEUNG}} In April 2012, [[Huffington Post]] contributor Jesse Kornbluth\nexamined this criticism in an article titled ''Unorthodox : The Hasidic Campaign Against Deborah Feldman \u2014 and Me'' which concluded \"There are claims in this book that Hasids have disputed. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s true. But I\u2019m sure of one thing: Men who can\u2019t live equally with women aren\u2019t worth living with.\"{{R|Kornbluth}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic
