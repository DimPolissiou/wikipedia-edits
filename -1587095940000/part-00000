The small rectangular chips with numbers are resistors, while the unmarked small rectangular chips are capacitors. The capacitors and resistors pictured are 0603 (1608 metric) package sizes, along with a very slightly larger 0805 (2012 metric) [[ferrite bead]].]]\n[[File:SMD capacitor.jpg|thumb|Surface-mount [[capacitor]]]]\n[[File:SMDcompared.jpeg|thumb|A [[MOSFET]] [[transistor]], placed upon a British postage stamp for size comparison.]]\n\n'''Surface-mount technology''' ('''SMT''') is a method in which the electrical components are mounted directly onto the surface of a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB). An electrical component mounted in this manner is referred to as a '''surface-mount device''' ('''SMD'''). In industry, this approach has largely replaced the [[through-hole technology]] construction method of fitting components, in large part because SMT allows for increased manufacturing automation. Both technologies can be used on the same board, with the through-hole technology often used for components not suitable for surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.\n\nAn SMT component is usually smaller than its through-hole counterpart because it has either smaller leads or no leads at all. It may have short [[lead (electronics)|pin]]s or leads of various styles, flat contacts, a matrix of [[solder ball]]s ([[ball grid array|BGA]]s), or terminations on the body of the component.\n\n== History ==\n\nSurface mounting was originally called \"planar mounting\".<ref name=\"SMC1999\">{{cite conference |title=Status of the Technology Industry Activities and Action Plan |url=http://www.ipc.org/4.0_Knowledge/4.1_Standards/smcstatus.pdf |conference=Surface Mount Technology |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=Paul |publisher=Surface Mount Council |year=1999 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228182745/http://www.ipc.org/4.0_Knowledge/4.1_Standards/smcstatus.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-28 }}</ref>\n\nSurface-mount technology was developed in the 1960s and became widely used in the mid 1980s.  By the late 1990s, the great majority of high-tech electronic printed circuit assemblies were dominated by surface mount devices.  Much of the pioneering work in this technology was done by [[IBM]]. The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a small-scale computer was later applied in the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer|Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]] used in the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] that guided all [[Saturn IB]] and [[Saturn V]] vehicles.<ref name=\"SpaceaholicA20120010\">{{cite web |url=http://spaceaholic.com/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/23 |title=Artifact: Digital Computer Memory and Circuit Boards, LVDC, Saturn IB/V Guidance, Navigation and Control |last=Schneeweis |first=Scott |work=Artifacts |publisher=Spaceaholic |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228184107/http://spaceaholic.com/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/23 |archive-date=2015-12-28 |access-date=2015-12-28 }}</ref> Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered to the surface of the PCB.  Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities and smaller circuit boards and, in turn, machines or subassemblies containing the boards.\n\nOften only the solder joints hold the parts to the board; in rare cases parts on the bottom or \"second\" side of the board may be secured with a dot of adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside [[reflow oven]]s if the part has a large size or weight.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a [[wave soldering]] process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously.  Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered on the same side of a board without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a [[Selective soldering|selective solder]] mask is used to prevent the solder holding those parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering.  Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates.\n\nConversely, SMT does not lend itself well to manual or low-automation fabrication, which is more economical and faster for one-off prototyping and small-scale production, and this is one reason why many through-hole components are still manufactured.  Some SMDs can be soldered with a temperature-controlled manual soldering iron, but unfortunately, those that are very small or have too fine a lead pitch are impossible to manually solder without expensive hot-air solder reflow equipment{{dubious|date=January 2018}}.  SMDs can be one-quarter to one-tenth the size and weight, and one-half to one-quarter the cost of equivalent through-hole parts, but on the other hand, the costs of a certain SMT part and of an equivalent through-hole part may be quite similar, though rarely is the SMT part more expensive.\n\n== Common abbreviations  ==\nDifferent terms describe the components, technique, and machines used in manufacturing. These terms are listed in the following table:\n   \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! SMp term !!

[[Solder paste]], a sticky mixture of [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] and tiny solder particles, is first applied to all the solder pads with a stainless steel or nickel stencil using a [[screen printing]] process.  It can also be applied by a jet-printing mechanism, similar to an [[inkjet printer]].  After pasting, the boards then proceed to the [[SMT placement equipment|pick-and-place machines]], where they are placed on a conveyor belt.  The components to be placed on the boards are usually delivered to the production line in either paper/plastic tapes wound on reels or plastic tubes.  Some large integrated circuits are delivered in static-free trays.  [[Numerical control]] pick-and-place machines remove the parts from the tapes, tubes or trays and place them on the PCB.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jena|first1=Hanings|title=PCB Assembly - Description|url=https://www.ourpcb.com/pcb-assembly|website=www.ourpcb.com|accessdate=7 February 2018|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe boards are then conveyed into the [[reflow soldering]] oven. They first enter a pre-heat zone, where the temperature of the board and all the components is gradually, uniformly raised. The boards then enter a zone where the temperature is high enough to melt the solder particles in the solder paste, bonding the component leads to the pads on the circuit board. The surface tension of the molten solder helps keep the components in place, and if the solder pad geometries are correctly designed, [[surface tension]] automatically aligns the components on their pads.\n\nThere are a number of ''techniques'' for reflowing solder. One is to use [[infrared]] lamps; this is called infrared reflow. Another is to use a hot gas [[convection]]. Another technology which is becoming popular again is special [[fluorocarbon]] liquids with high boiling points which use a method called vapor phase reflow. Due to environmental concerns, this method was falling out of favor until lead-free legislation was introduced which requires tighter controls on soldering. At the end of 2008, convection soldering was the most popular reflow technology using either standard air or nitrogen gas. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. With infrared reflow, the board designer must lay the board out so that short components don't fall into the shadows of tall components. Component location is less restricted if the designer knows that vapor phase reflow or convection soldering will be used in production. Following reflow soldering, certain irregular or heat-sensitive components may be installed and soldered by hand, or in large-scale automation, by focused infrared beam (FIB) or localized convection equipment.\n\nIf the circuit board is double-sided then this printing, placement, reflow process may be repeated using either solder paste or glue to hold the components in place. If a [[wave soldering]] process is used, then the parts must be [[glue]]d to the board prior to processing to prevent them from floating off when the solder paste holding them in place is melted.\n\nAfter soldering, the boards may be washed to remove flux residues and any stray solder balls that could short out closely spaced component leads. [[Rosin]] flux is removed with fluorocarbon solvents, high [[flash point]] [[hydrocarbon]] solvents, or low flash solvents e.g. [[limonene]] (derived from orange peels) which require extra rinsing or drying cycles. Water-soluble fluxes are removed with [[deionized water]] and detergent, followed by an air blast to quickly remove residual water.  However, most electronic assemblies are made using a \"No-Clean\" process where the flux residues are designed to be left on the circuit board, since they are considered harmless. This saves the cost of cleaning, speeds up the manufacturing process, and reduces waste. However, it is generally suggested to wash the assembly, even when a \"No-Clean\" process is used, when the application uses very high frequency clock signals (in excess of 1&nbsp;GHz). Another reason to remove no-clean residues is to improve adhesion of [[conformal coating]]s and underfill materials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/84286-why-clean-no-clean|title=Why Clean No-Clean?|last=|first=|date=|work=Assembly Magazine|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en}}</ref> Regardless of cleaning or not those PCBs, current industry trend suggests to carefully review a PCB assembly process where \"No-Clean\" is applied, since flux residues trapped under components and RF shields may affect surface insulation resistance (SIR), especially on high component density boards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipc.org/feature-article.aspx?aid=To-clean-or-not-to-clean|title=No-clean is a process, not a product|website=www.ipc.org|access-date=2017-10-03}}</ref>\n\nCertain manufacturing standards, such as those written by the [[IPC (electronics)|IPC - Association Connecting Electronics Industries]] require cleaning regardless of the solder flux type used to ensure a thoroughly clean board. Proper cleaning removes all traces of solder flux, as well as dirt and other contaminants that may be invisible to the naked eye. No-Clean or other soldering processes may leave \"white residues\" that, according to IPC, are acceptable \"provided that these residues have been qualified and documented as benign\".<ref>IPC-A-610E, paragraph 10.6.3.</ref> However, while shops conforming to IPC standard are expected to adhere to the Association's rules on board condition, not all manufacturing facilities apply IPC standard, nor are they required to do so. Additionally, in some applications, such as low-end electronics, such stringent manufacturing methods are excessive both in expense and time required.\n\nFinally, the boards are visually inspected for missing or misaligned components and solder bridging.

In most cases a rework system is the better choice because SMD work with a soldering iron requires considerable skill and is not always feasible.\n\nReworking usually corrects some type of error, either human- or machine-generated, and includes the following steps:\n\n* Melt solder and remove component(s)\n* Remove residual solder\n* Print solder paste on PCB, directly or by dispensing\n* Place new component and reflow.\n\nSometimes hundreds or thousands of the same part need to be repaired. Such errors, if due to assembly, are often caught during the process. However, a whole new level of rework arises when component failure is discovered too late, and perhaps unnoticed until the end user of the device being manufactured experiences it. Rework can also be used if products of sufficient value to justify it require revision or re-engineering, perhaps to change a single firmware-based component. Reworking in large volume requires an operation designed for that purpose.\n\nThere are essentially two non-contact soldering/desoldering methods: infrared soldering and soldering with hot gas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smt.iconnect007.com/index.php/article/107339/two-prevalent-rework-heating-methods-which-one-is-best/107342/|title=Two Prevalent Rework Heating Methods--Which One is Best?|last=|first=|date=|website=smt.iconnect007.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>\n\n===Infrared===\nWith infrared soldering, the energy for heating up the solder joint is transmitted by long- or short-wave infrared electromagnetic radiation.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Easy setup\n* No compressed air required\n* No requirement for different nozzles for many component shapes and sizes, reducing cost and the need to change nozzles\n* Fast reaction of infrared source (depends on system used)\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Central areas will be heated more than peripheral areas\n* Temperature control is less precise, and there may be peaks\n* Nearby components must be shielded from heat to prevent damage, which requires additional time for every board\n* Surface temperature depends on the component's [[albedo]]: dark surfaces will be heated more than lighter surfaces\n* The temperature additionally depends on the surface shape.

The electronics industry has standardized package shapes and sizes (the leading standardisation body is [[JEDEC]]).\n\n== Identification ==\n\n; Resistors: For 5% precision SMD resistors usually are marked with their resistance values using three digits: two significant digits and a multiplier digit. These are quite often white lettering on a black background, but other colored backgrounds and lettering can be used. The black or colored coating is usually only on one face of the device, the sides and other face simply being the uncoated, usually white ceramic substrate. The coated surface, with the resistive element beneath is normally positioned face up when the device is soldered to the board, although they can be seen in rare cases mounted with the uncoated underside face up, whereby the resistance value code is not visible. For 1% precision SMD resistors, the code is used, as three digits would otherwise not convey enough information. This code consists of two digits and a letter: the digits denote the value's position in the E96 sequence, while the letter indicates the multiplier.<ref name=\"ResistorGuideSMD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-smd-code/ |title=Resistor SMD code |publisher=Resistor Guide |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228233523/http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-smd-code/ |archive-date=2015-12-28 |access-date=2015-12-28 }}</ref>\n; Capacitors: Non-electrolytic capacitors are usually unmarked and the only reliable method of determining their value is removal from the circuit and subsequent measurement with a capacitance meter or impedance bridge. The materials used to fabricate the capacitors, such as nickel tantalate, possess different colours and these can give an approximate idea of the capacitance of the component. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Generally physical size is proportional to capacitance and (squared) voltage for the same dielectric. For example, a 100&nbsp;nF, 50&nbsp;V capacitor may come in the same package as a 10&nbsp;nF, 150&nbsp;V device. SMD (non-electrolytic) capacitors, which are usually monolithic ceramic capacitors, exhibit the same body color on all four faces not covered by the end caps. SMD electrolytic capacitors, usually tantalum capacitors, and [[film capacitor]]s are marked like resistors, with two significant figures and a multiplier in units of picofarads or pF, (10<sup>\u221212</sup> farad.)\n; Inductors: Smaller inductance with moderately high current ratings are usually of the ferrite bead type. They are simply a metal conductor looped through a ferrite bead and almost the same as their through-hole versions but possess SMD end caps rather than leads. They appear dark grey and are magnetic, unlike capacitors with a similar dark grey appearance. These ferrite bead type are limited to small values in the [[nanohenry]] (nH) range and are often used as power supply rail decouplers or in high frequency parts of a circuit. Larger inductors and transformers may of course be through-hole mounted on the same board. SMT inductors with larger inductance values often have turns of wire or flat strap around the body or embedded in clear epoxy, allowing the wire or strap to be seen. Sometimes a [[ferrite core]] is present also. These higher inductance types are often limited to small current ratings, although some of the flat strap types can handle a few amps. As with capacitors, component values and identifiers for smaller inductors are not usually marked on the component itself; if not documented or printed on the PCB, measurement, usually removed from the circuit, is the only way of determining them. Larger inductors, especially wire-wound types in larger footprints, usually have the value printed on the top. For example, \"330\", which equates to a value of 33{{nbsp}}[[microhenry|\u03bcH]].\n; Discrete semiconductors: Discrete semiconductors, such as diodes and transistors are often marked with a two- or three-symbol code. The same code marked on different packages or on devices from different manufacturers can translate to different devices. Many of these codes, used because the devices are too small to be marked with more traditional numbers used on larger packages, correlate to more familiar traditional part numbers when a correlation list is consulted. GM4PMK in the United Kingdom has prepared a [http://www.marsport.org.uk/smd/mainframe.htm correlation list], and a [http://elektronik.googlecode.com/files/SMD_Catalog222.pdf similar .pdf list] is also available, although these lists are not complete.\n; Integrated circuits: Generally, integrated circuit packages are large enough to be imprinted with the complete part number which includes the manufacturer's specific prefix, or a significant segment of the part number and the manufacturer's name or [[logo]]. Examples of manufacturers' specific prefixes include the Philips HEF4066 or Motorola MC14066 (a 4066 Quad Analog Switch) and the Fujitsu Electric FA5502 (a 5502M Boost Architecture [[power factor correction]] controller).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Board-to-board connector]]s\n* [[Chip carrier]]\n* [[Electronics]]\n* [[Electronics manufacturing services]]\n* [[List of electronics package dimensions]]\n* [[List of integrated circuit packaging types]]\n* [[Plastic leaded chip carrier]]\n* [[Point-to-point construction]]\n* [[Printed circuit board]]\n* [[RoHS]]\n* [[SMT placement equipment]]\n* [[Through-hole technology]]\n* [[Wire wrap]]\n* [[RKM code]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Surface mount technology}}\n\n{{Semiconductor packages}}\n{{Electronic components}}\n\n[[Category:Chip carriers]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n\n[[de:Surface-mounted device]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2017}}[[File:Smt closeup.jpg|thumb|Surface-mount components on a [[USB flash drive]]'s circuit board.

An electrical components mounted in this manner is referred to as a '''surface-mount device''' ('''SMD'''). In industry, this approach has largely replaced the [[through-hole technology]] construction method of fitting components, in large part because SMT allows for increased manufacturing automation. Both technologies can be used on the same board, with the through-hole technology often used for components not suitable for surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.\n\nAn SMT component is usually smaller than its through-hole counterpart because it has either smaller leads or no leads at all. It may have short [[lead (electronics)|pin]]s or leads of various styles, flat contacts, a matrix of [[solder ball]]s ([[ball grid array|BGA]]s), or terminations on the body of the component.\n\n== History ==\n\nSurface mounting was originally called \"planar mounting\".<ref name=\"SMC1999\">{{cite conference |title=Status of the Technology Industry Activities and Action Plan |url=http://www.ipc.org/4.0_Knowledge/4.1_Standards/smcstatus.pdf |conference=Surface Mount Technology |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=Paul |publisher=Surface Mount Council |year=1999 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228182745/http://www.ipc.org/4.0_Knowledge/4.1_Standards/smcstatus.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-28 }}</ref>\n\nSurface-mount technology was developed in the 1960s and became widely used in the mid 1980s.  By the late 1990s, the great majority of high-tech electronic printed circuit assemblies were dominated by surface mount devices.  Much of the pioneering work in this technology was done by [[IBM]]. The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a small-scale computer was later applied in the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer|Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]] used in the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] that guided all [[Saturn IB]] and [[Saturn V]] vehicles.<ref name=\"SpaceaholicA20120010\">{{cite web |url=http://spaceaholic.com/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/23 |title=Artifact: Digital Computer Memory and Circuit Boards, LVDC, Saturn IB/V Guidance, Navigation and Control |last=Schneeweis |first=Scott |work=Artifacts |publisher=Spaceaholic |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228184107/http://spaceaholic.com/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/23 |archive-date=2015-12-28 |access-date=2015-12-28 }}</ref> Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered to the surface of the PCB.  Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities and smaller circuit boards and, in turn, machines or subassemblies containing the boards.\n\nOften only the solder joints hold the parts to the board; in rare cases parts on the bottom or \"second\" side of the board may be secured with a dot of adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside [[reflow oven]]s if the part has a large size or weight.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a [[wave soldering]] process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously.  Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered on the same side of a board without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a [[Selective soldering|selective solder]] mask is used to prevent the solder holding those parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering.  Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates.\n\nConversely, SMT does not lend itself well to manual or low-automation fabrication, which is more economical and faster for one-off prototyping and small-scale production, and this is one reason why many through-hole components are still manufactured.  Some SMDs can be soldered with a temperature-controlled manual soldering iron, but unfortunately, those that are very small or have too fine a lead pitch are impossible to manually solder without expensive hot-air solder reflow equipment{{dubious|date=January 2018}}.  SMDs can be one-quarter to one-tenth the size and weight, and one-half to one-quarter the cost of equivalent through-hole parts, but on the other hand, the costs of a certain SMT part and of an equivalent through-hole part may be quite similar, though rarely is the SMT part more expensive.\n\n== Common abbreviations  ==\nDifferent terms describe the components, technique, and machines used in manufacturing.

[[Solder paste]], a sticky mixture of [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] and tiny solder particles, is first applied to all the solder pads with a stainless steel or nickel stencil using a [[screen printing]] process.  It can also be applied by a jet-printing mechanism, similar to an [[inkjet printer]].  After pasting, the boards then proceed to the [[SMT placement equipment|pick-and-place machines]], where they are placed on a conveyor belt.  The components to be placed on the boards are usually delivered to the production line in either paper/plastic tapes wound on reels or plastic tubes.  Some large integrated circuits are delivered in static-free trays.  [[Numerical control]] pick-and-place machines remove the parts from the tapes, tubes or trays and place them on the PCB.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jena|first1=Hanings|title=PCB Assembly - Description|url=https://www.ourpcb.com/pcb-assembly|website=www.ourpcb.com|accessdate=7 February 2018|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe boards are then conveyed into the [[reflow soldering]] oven. They first enter a pre-heat zone, where the temperature of the board and all the components is gradually, uniformly raised. The boards then enter a zone where the temperature is high enough to melt the solder particles in the solder paste, bonding the component leads to the pads on the circuit board. The surface tension of the molten solder helps keep the components in place, and if the solder pad geometries are correctly designed, [[surface tension]] automatically aligns the components on their pads.\n\nThere are a number of ''techniques'' for reflowing solder. One is to use [[infrared]] lamps; this is called infrared reflow. Another is to use a hot gas [[convection]]. Another technology which is becoming popular again is special [[fluorocarbon]] liquids with high boiling points which use a method called vapor phase reflow. Due to environmental concerns, this method was falling out of favor until lead-free legislation was introduced which requires tighter controls on soldering. At the end of 2008, convection soldering was the most popular reflow technology using either standard air or nitrogen gas. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. With infrared reflow, the board designer must lay the board out so that short components don't fall into the shadows of tall components. Component location is less restricted if the designer knows that vapor phase reflow or convection soldering will be used in production. Following reflow soldering, certain irregular or heat-sensitive components may be installed and soldered by hand, or in large-scale automation, by focused infrared beam (FIB) or localized convection equipment.\n\nIf the circuit board is double-sided then this printing, placement, reflow process may be repeated using either solder paste or glue to hold the components in place. If a [[wave soldering]] process is used, then the parts must be [[glue]]d to the board prior to processing to prevent them from floating off when the solder paste holding them in place is melted.\n\nAfter soldering, the boards may be washed to remove flux residues and any stray solder balls that could short out closely spaced component leads. [[Rosin]] flux is removed with fluorocarbon solvents, high [[flash point]] [[hydrocarbon]] solvents, or low flash solvents e.g. [[limonene]] (derived from orange peels) which require extra rinsing or drying cycles. Water-soluble fluxes are removed with [[deionized water]] and detergent, followed by an air blast to quickly remove residual water.  However, most electronic assemblies are made using a \"No-Clean\" process where the flux residues are designed to be left on the circuit board, since they are considered harmless. This saves the cost of cleaning, speeds up the manufacturing process, and reduces waste. However, it is generally suggested to wash the assembly, even when a \"No-Clean\" process is used, when the application uses very high frequency clock signals (in excess of 1&nbsp;GHz). Another reason to remove no-clean residues is to improve adhesion of [[conformal coating]]s and underfill materials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/84286-why-clean-no-clean|title=Why Clean No-Clean?|last=|first=|date=|work=Assembly Magazine|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en}}</ref> Regardless of cleaning or not those PCBs, current industry trend suggests to carefully review a PCB assembly process where \"No-Clean\" is applied, since flux residues trapped under components and RF shields may affect surface insulation resistance (SIR), especially on high component density boards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipc.org/feature-article.aspx?aid=To-clean-or-not-to-clean|title=No-clean is a process, not a product|website=www.ipc.org|access-date=2017-10-03}}</ref>\n\nCertain manufacturing standards, such as those written by the [[IPC (electronics)|IPC - Association Connecting Electronics Industries]] require cleaning regardless of the solder flux type used to ensure a thoroughly clean board. Proper cleaning removes all traces of solder flux, as well as dirt and other contaminants that may be invisible to the naked eye. No-Clean or other soldering processes may leave \"white residues\" that, according to IPC, are acceptable \"provided that these residues have been qualified and documented as benign\".<ref>IPC-A-610E, paragraph 10.6.3.</ref> However, while shops conforming to IPC standard are expected to adhere to the Association's rules on board condition, not all manufacturing facilities apply IPC standard, nor are they required to do so. Additionally, in some applications, such as low-end electronics, such stringent manufacturing methods are excessive both in expense and time required.\n\nFinally, the boards are visually inspected for missing or misaligned components and solder bridging.  If needed, they are sent to a [[#Rework|rework]] station where a human operator repairs any errors.  They are then usually sent to the testing stations ([[in-circuit test]]ing and/or functional testing) to verify that they operate correctly.\n\n[[Automated optical inspection]] (AOI) systems are commonly used in PCB manufacturing.

This is a disadvantage for prototyping, repair, rework, reverse engineering, and possibly for production set-up.\n\n== Rework ==\n[[File:Soldering a 0805.jpg|thumb|Removal of surface-mount device using [[Soldering iron#Soldering tweezers|soldering tweezers]]]]\n{{main | Rework (electronics) }}\n\nDefective surface-mount components can be repaired by using [[soldering iron]]s (for some connections), or using a non-contact rework system. In most cases a rework system is the better choice because SMD work with a soldering iron requires considerable skill and is not always feasible.\n\nReworking usually corrects some type of error, either human- or machine-generated, and includes the following steps:\n\n* Melt solder and remove component(s)\n* Remove residual solder\n* Print solder paste on PCB, directly or by dispensing\n* Place new component and reflow.\n\nSometimes hundreds or thousands of the same part need to be repaired. Such errors, if due to assembly, are often caught during the process. However, a whole new level of rework arises when component failure is discovered too late, and perhaps unnoticed until the end user of the device being manufactured experiences it. Rework can also be used if products of sufficient value to justify it require revision or re-engineering, perhaps to change a single firmware-based component. Reworking in large volume requires an operation designed for that purpose.\n\nThere are essentially two non-contact soldering/desoldering methods: infrared soldering and soldering with hot gas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smt.iconnect007.com/index.php/article/107339/two-prevalent-rework-heating-methods-which-one-is-best/107342/|title=Two Prevalent Rework Heating Methods--Which One is Best?|last=|first=|date=|website=smt.iconnect007.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>\n\n===Infrared===\nWith infrared soldering, the energy for heating up the solder joint is transmitted by long- or short-wave infrared electromagnetic radiation.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Easy setup\n* No compressed air required\n* No requirement for different nozzles for many component shapes and sizes, reducing cost and the need to change nozzles\n* Fast reaction of infrared source (depends on system used)\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Central areas will be heated more than peripheral areas\n* Temperature control is less precise, and there may be peaks\n* Nearby components must be shielded from heat to prevent damage, which requires additional time for every board\n* Surface temperature depends on the component's [[albedo]]: dark surfaces will be heated more than lighter surfaces\n* The temperature additionally depends on the surface shape. Convective loss of energy will reduce the temperature of the component\n* No reflow atmosphere possible\n\n===Hot gas===\nDuring hot gas soldering, the energy for heating up the solder joint is transmitted by a hot gas. This can be air or inert gas ([[nitrogen]]).\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Simulating reflow oven atmosphere\n* Some systems allow switching between hot air and nitrogen\n* Standard and component-specific nozzles allow high reliability and faster processing\n* Allow reproducible soldering profiles\n* Efficient heating, large amounts of heat can be transferred\n* Even heating of the affected board area\n* Temperature of the component will never exceed the adjusted gas temperature\n* Rapid cooling after reflow, resulting in small-grained solder joints (depends on system used)\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Thermal capacity of the heat generator results in slow reaction whereby thermal profiles can be distorted (depends on system used)\n\n== Packages ==\n[[File:SMT sizes, based on original by Zureks.svg|thumb|Example of component sizes, metric and imperial codes and comparison included]]\n{{main|Chip carrier}}\n\nSurface-mount components are usually smaller than their counterparts with leads, and are designed to be handled by machines rather than by humans.  The electronics industry has standardized package shapes and sizes (the leading standardisation body is [[JEDEC]]).\n\n== Identification ==\n\n; Resistors: For 5% precision SMD resistors usually are marked with their resistance values using three digits: two significant digits and a multiplier digit. These are quite often white lettering on a black background, but other colored backgrounds and lettering can be used. The black or colored coating is usually only on one face of the device, the sides and other face simply being the uncoated, usually white ceramic substrate. The coated surface, with the resistive element beneath is normally positioned face up when the device is soldered to the board, although they can be seen in rare cases mounted with the uncoated underside face up, whereby the resistance value code is not visible. For 1% precision SMD resistors, the code is used, as three digits would otherwise not convey enough information. This code consists of two digits and a letter: the digits denote the value's position in the E96 sequence, while the letter indicates the multiplier.<ref name=\"ResistorGuideSMD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-smd-code/ |title=Resistor SMD code |publisher=Resistor Guide |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228233523/http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-smd-code/ |archive-date=2015-12-28 |access-date=2015-12-28 }}</ref>\n; Capacitors: Non-electrolytic capacitors are usually unmarked and the only reliable method of determining their value is removal from the circuit and subsequent measurement with a capacitance meter or impedance bridge. The materials used to fabricate the capacitors, such as nickel tantalate, possess different colours and these can give an approximate idea of the capacitance of the component. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Generally physical size is proportional to capacitance and (squared) voltage for the same dielectric. For example, a 100&nbsp;nF, 50&nbsp;V capacitor may come in the same package as a 10&nbsp;nF, 150&nbsp;V device. SMD (non-electrolytic) capacitors, which are usually monolithic ceramic capacitors, exhibit the same body color on all four faces not covered by the end caps. SMD electrolytic capacitors, usually tantalum capacitors, and [[film capacitor]]s are marked like resistors, with two significant figures and a multiplier in units of picofarads or pF, (10<sup>\u221212</sup> farad.)\n; Inductors: Smaller inductance with moderately high current ratings are usually of the ferrite bead type. They are simply a metal conductor looped through a ferrite bead and almost the same as their through-hole versions but possess SMD end caps rather than leads. They appear dark grey and are magnetic, unlike capacitors with a similar dark grey appearance. These ferrite bead type are limited to small values in the [[nanohenry]] (nH) range and are often used as power supply rail decouplers or in high frequency parts of a circuit. Larger inductors and transformers may of course be through-hole mounted on the same board. SMT inductors with larger inductance values often have turns of wire or flat strap around the body or embedded in clear epoxy, allowing the wire or strap to be seen. Sometimes a [[ferrite core]] is present also. These higher inductance types are often limited to small current ratings, although some of the flat strap types can handle a few amps. As with capacitors, component values and identifiers for smaller inductors are not usually marked on the component itself; if not documented or printed on the PCB, measurement, usually removed from the circuit, is the only way of determining them. Larger inductors, especially wire-wound types in larger footprints, usually have the value printed on the top. For example, \"330\", which equates to a value of 33{{nbsp}}[[microhenry|\u03bcH]].\n; Discrete semiconductors: Discrete semiconductors, such as diodes and transistors are often marked with a two- or three-symbol code. The same code marked on different packages or on devices from different manufacturers can translate to different devices. Many of these codes, used because the devices are too small to be marked with more traditional numbers used on larger packages, correlate to more familiar traditional part numbers when a correlation list is consulted. GM4PMK in the United Kingdom has prepared a [http://www.marsport.org.uk/smd/mainframe.htm correlation list], and a [http://elektronik.googlecode.com/files/SMD_Catalog222.pdf similar .pdf list] is also available, although these lists are not complete.\n; Integrated circuits: Generally, integrated circuit packages are large enough to be imprinted with the complete part number which includes the manufacturer's specific prefix, or a significant segment of the part number and the manufacturer's name or [[logo]]. Examples of manufacturers' specific prefixes include the Philips HEF4066 or Motorola MC14066 (a 4066 Quad Analog Switch) and the Fujitsu Electric FA5502 (a 5502M Boost Architecture [[power factor correction]] controller).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Board-to-board connector]]s\n* [[Chip carrier]]\n* [[Electronics]]\n* [[Electronics manufacturing services]]\n* [[List of electronics package dimensions]]\n* [[List of integrated circuit packaging types]]\n* [[Plastic leaded chip carrier]]\n* [[Point-to-point construction]]\n* [[Printed circuit board]]\n* [[RoHS]]\n* [[SMT placement equipment]]\n* [[Through-hole technology]]\n* [[Wire wrap]]\n* [[RKM code]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Surface mount technology}}\n\n{{Semiconductor packages}}\n{{Electronic components}}\n\n[[Category:Chip carriers]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n\n[[de:Surface-mounted device]]\n", "name_user": "IMagUdspEllr", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology"}

possible in view of God's omnipotence and appropriate in view of Mary's role as [[Mother of God]]: ''Potuit, decuit, fecit'', \"it was possible, it was fitting, therefore it was done;\"{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36-37}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274), among others, objected that if Mary were free of original sin at her conception then she would have no need of redemption, making Christ superfluous; they were answered answered by [[Duns Scotus]] (1264-1308), who reasoned that her preservation from original sin was a redemption more perfect than that granted through Christ.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=37-38}} \n\nNevertheless, it was not theological theory that initiated discussion of Mary's freedom from mankind's curse, but the celebration of her [[liturgy]], for the popular feast of her conception brought forth the objection that as sexual intercourse is sinful, to celebrate Mary's conception was to celebrate a sinful event.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} Some held that no sin had occurred, for Anne had conceived Mary not through sex but by kissing her husband Joachim, and that Anne's father and mother had likewise been conceived; but [[St Bridget of Sweden]] (c.1303-1373) told how Mary herself had revealed to her in a vision that although Anne and Joachim conceived their daughter through sexual union, the act was sinless because free of sexual desire.{{sfn|Solberg|2018|p=108-109}} \n\nIn 1431 the [[Council of Basel]] declared Mary's Immaculate Conception a \"pious opinion\" consistent with faith and Scripture; the [[Council of Trent]], held in several sessions in the early 1500s, made no explicit declaration on the subject but exempted her from the universality of original sin; and by 1571 the Pope's [[Breviary]] (prayerbook) set out an elaborate celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=4-5,117}}\n\n===''Ineffabilis Deus''===\nIt was popular support

''Ineffabilis Deus'' was promulgated.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}} (A dogma is a divinely revealed truth proclaimed by the Church and binding on the faithful as necessary to

1878.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} Up until this point it had been understood that dogma had to be based in Scripture and acepted by tradition,{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} but Mary's immaculate conception is not stated in the New Testament and cannot be deduced from it,{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} and it had caused a virtual civil war between [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s during the middle ages.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=335}} ''Ineffabilis Deus'' therefore was a novelty, being based instead on the declaration of a special commission to the effect that neither Scripture nor tradition were necessary to define dogma, but only the authority of the Church expressed in the Pope.{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} The Pope and his [[Curia]] (the special body which forms the central government of the Church) accordingly waived the absence of scriptural proof or a \"broad and ancient\" stream of tradition and promulgated Mary's Immaculate Conception solely on [[papal infallibility]],{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204-205}} itself promulgated as dogma in 1870.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}} (Catholics unable to accept papal infallibility left the Roman Church and formed the

the basis for the Immaculate Conception: \"The most glorious Virgin ... was foretold by God when he said to the serpent: 'I will put enmity between you and the woman,'\"{{sfn|Manelli|1994|p=6-7}} a prophecy which reached fulfillment in the figure of the Woman in the [[Revelation of John]], crowned with stars and trampling the Dragon underfoot.{{sfn|Twomey|2008|p=73-74}} Luke 1:28, and

Its celebration seems to have begun in the Eastern church in the 7th century and may have spread to Ireland by the 8th, although the earliest well-attested record in the Western church is from England early in the 11th.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It was suppressed there after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), and the first thorough exposition of the doctrine was a response to this suppression.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It continued to spread despite strong theological objections{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=128}} (in 1125 [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote to Lyons Cathedral to express his surprise and concern that it had recently begun to be observed there),{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} but in 1477 [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, placed it on the Roman calendar (i.e, list of Church festivals and observances).{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643}} [[Pius V]] suppressed it,{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=38}} but following the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' it was restored with the typically Franciscan phrase \"immaculate conception\" and given a formulary for the Mass, drawn largely from one composed for Sixtus IV, beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin...\". {{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643-644}}\n\nBy pontifical decree a number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception. These include [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea|Korea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]] (including the old kingdoms and the present state), the [[United States]] and [[Uruguay]]. By royal decree under the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], she is the principal Patroness of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Prayers and hymns==\nThe [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Rite]] [[Liturgy of the Hours]] naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \"[[Tota pulchra es|Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te]]\" (\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\" It continues: \"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun. You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you. You are the glory of Jerusalem, you are the joy of Israel, you give honour to our people. You are all beautiful, Mary.\")<ref>The text (in [[Latin]]) is given at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQh0jLR2Iks Tota Pulchra Es \u2013 GMEA Honor Chorus.]</ref> On the basis of the original [[Gregorian chant]] music,<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uJEr669ts|title=Tota pulchra es Maria, Canto gregoriano nella devozione mariana, studio di Giovanni Vianini, Milano|date=November 6, 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> polyphonic settings have been composed by [[Anton Bruckner]],<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k23PLEuG-h8|title=Anton Bruckner \u2013  Tota pulchra es|date=October 3, 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> [[Pablo Casals]], [[Maurice Durufl\u00e9]],<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhmVu7xgpBc|title=Maurice Durufl\u00e9: Tota pulchra es Maria|date=May 23, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]],<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaqFtF2HDTk|title=Tota pulchra es \u2013 Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki|date=June 17, 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> [[:no:Ola Gjeilo]],<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKooq6HWDI|title=TOTA PULCHRA ES GREX VOCALIS|date=May 21, 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> [[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]],<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVH0fkNY-xA|title=Tota pulchra es, Maria Canto gregoriano nella devozione mariana|date=September 21, 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> and [[:de:Nikolaus Schapfl|Nikolaus Schapfl]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0KizZtM9-c|title=Tota Pulchra   \u2013   Composed by Nikolaus Schapfl (*1963)|date=January 4, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOther prayers honouring Mary's immaculate conception are in use outside the formal liturgy.

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the depiction of \"Our Lady\" seems to have been finally established by the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] in his  \"El arte de la pintura\" of 1649: a beautiful young girl of 12 or 13, wearing a white tunic and blue mantle, rays of light emanating from her head ringed by twelve stars and crowned by an imperial crown, the sun behind her and the moon beneath her feet.{{sfn|Moffitt|2001|p=676}} Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.{{sfn|Katz|Orsi|2001|p=98}} The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.{{sfn|Jenner|2009|p=3-9}}\n\n<br>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

from the moment of her [[Conception (biology)|conception]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=330}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Definition\">\"The Virgin Mary was preserved entirely free from original sin from the instant of her conception through a special prevenient grace, received in view of the merits of her Son in anticipation of the Redemption.\" See Reynolds (20102), p.330.</ref> It proved highly controversial in the Middle Ages, but revived in the 19th century and was adopted as Church dogma when Pope [[Pius IX]] promulgated ''Ineffabilis Deus'' in 1854.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}}{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} The move had the overwhelming support of the Church hierarchy, although a few, including the Archbishop of Paris and others, warned that it is not stated in the New Testament and could not be deduced from it.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} Protestants overwhelmingly rejected ''Ineffabilis Deus'' as an exercise in papal power and the doctrine itself as without foundation in Scripture,{{sfn|Herringer|2019|p=507}} and [[Orthodox Christianity]], although it revers Mary in its liturgy, called on the Roman church to return to the faith of the early centuries.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1981|p=90}} The feast day is 8 December.\n\n(The Immaculate Conception of Mary in the womb of her mother is not to be confused with her purity in the [[virgin birth of Jesus]]).{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=272}}\n\n==Doctrine==\n\nThe Immaculate Conception of Mary is one of the four [[Mariology|Marian]] dogmas of the Catholic Church, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is [[heresy]].{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=133}} Defined by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, it states that Mary, through God's grace, was conceived free from the stain of [[original sin]] in view of her role as the [[Mother of God]]:{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}}\n\n<blockquote>\nWe declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.{{sfn|Sheed|1958|p=134-138}}\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile the doctrine asserts only Mary's freedom from original sin, the [[Council of Trent]], held between 1545 and 1563, affirmed in addition her freedom from personal sin.{{sfn|Fastiggi|2019|p=455}}\n\n==History==\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n===Anna, mother of Mary===\nThe mother of Mary is not a biblical character.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11}} She first appears in the late 2nd century [[Protevangelium of James]], which names her [[Saint Anne|Anne]], probably from [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]], the mother of the prophet [[Samuel]]; she and her husband [[Saint Joachim]] are infertile, but God hears their prayers for a child, and so Mary is conceived and born, and, like Samuel, is taken to spend her childhood in the temple.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} In the earliest texts, probably representing the original version, the conception occurs without [[sexual intercourse]] between Anne and Joachim, but the story does not advance the idea of an immaculate conception.{{sfn|Shoemaker|2016|p=unpaginated}} The Protevangelium does not advance the idea that Mary was conceived without [[original sin]].{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} \n\n===Original sin===\nOriginal sin was defined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD).{{sfn|Wiley|2002|p=37}} Engaged in a controversy with the monk [[Pelagius]] over the question of whether infants could sin (Pelagius said they could not and therefore would not go to hell if unbaptised), he inserted original sin and the fall from grace into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and Paul's [[Letter to the Romans]],{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} it is not part of the story of [[Adam and Eve]]{{sfn|Toews|2013|pp=88}} and the [[Apostle Paul]] regarded sin and death not as a punishment for Adam's sin but as the natural lot of mankind.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Augustine also identified male semen as the means by which original sin was made heritable, leaving only Jesus Christ, conceived without semen, free of the sin passed down from Adam through the sexual act,{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} a sentiment echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=43}}\n\n===Medieval formulation===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876. Saint Antony's Church, [[Urtij\u00ebi]], Italy.]]\nMary's [[sinlessness of Mary|freedom from personal sin]] was affirmed in the 4th century, but Augustine's argument that original sin was transmitted through sex raised the question of whether she could also be free of the sin of Adam.{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}} The English ecclesiastic and scholar [[Eadmer]] (c.1060-c.1126) reasoned that it was possible in view of God's omnipotence and appropriate in view of Mary's role as [[Mother of God]]: ''Potuit, decuit, fecit'', \"it was possible, it was fitting, therefore it was done;\"{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36-37}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274), among others, objected that if Mary were free of original sin at her conception then she would have no need of redemption, making Christ superfluous; they were answered answered by [[Duns Scotus]] (1264-1308), who reasoned that her preservation from original sin was a redemption more perfect than that granted through Christ.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=37-38}} \n\nNevertheless, it was not theological theory that initiated discussion of Mary's freedom from mankind's curse, but the celebration of her [[liturgy]], for the popular feast of her conception brought forth the objection that as sexual intercourse is sinful, to celebrate Mary's conception was to celebrate a sinful event.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} Some held that no sin had occurred, for Anne had conceived Mary not through sex but by kissing her husband Joachim, and that Anne's father and mother had likewise been conceived; but [[St Bridget of Sweden]] (c.1303-1373) told how Mary herself had revealed to her in a vision that although Anne and Joachim conceived their daughter through sexual union, the act was sinless because free of sexual desire.{{sfn|Solberg|2018|p=108-109}} \n\nIn 1431 the [[Council of Basel]] declared Mary's Immaculate Conception a \"pious opinion\" consistent with faith and Scripture; the [[Council of Trent]], held in several sessions in the early 1500s, made no explicit declaration on the subject but exempted her from the universality of original sin; and by 1571 the Pope's [[Breviary]] (prayerbook) set out an elaborate celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=4-5,117}}\n\n===''Ineffabilis Deus''===\nIt was popular support which led to the demand that the Papacy elevate the doctrine to the status of dogma.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=6}} In 1830 [[Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (May 2, 1806-December 31, 1876) was granted a vision of the Immaculate Conception standing on a globe while a voice commanded Catherine to have a medal made in imitation of what she saw,{{sfn|Mack|2003}} and the apparition marked the beginning of a great 19th century Marian revival.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=29}} At the time the Church was engaged in a struggle against  modernity and the promotion of its authority,{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=249}} and in 1849 Pope [[Pius IX]] asked the Bishops of the Church for their views on whether the doctrine should be defined as dogma: ninety percent of those who responded were supportive, and in 1854 the Bull ''Ineffabilis Deus'' was promulgated.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}} (A dogma is a divinely revealed truth proclaimed by the Church and binding on the faithful as necessary to salvation).{{sfn|O'Collins|1983|p=162}}\n\n''Ineffabilis Deus'' was one of the pivotal events of the papacy of Pius, pope from 16 June 1846 to his death on 7 February 1878.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} Up until this point it had been understood that dogma had to be based in Scripture and acepted by tradition,{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} but Mary's immaculate conception is not stated in the New Testament and cannot be deduced from it,{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} and it had caused a virtual civil war between [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s during the middle ages.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=335}} ''Ineffabilis Deus'' therefore was a novelty, being based instead on the declaration of a special commission to the effect that neither Scripture nor tradition were necessary to define dogma, but only the authority of the Church expressed in the Pope.{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} The Pope and his [[Curia]] (the special body which forms the central government of the Church) accordingly waived the absence of scriptural proof or a \"broad and ancient\" stream of tradition and promulgated Mary's Immaculate Conception solely on [[papal infallibility]],{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204-205}} itself promulgated as dogma in 1870.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}} (Catholics unable to accept papal infallibility left the Roman Church and formed the [[Old Catholic Church]], which rejects also the Immaculate Conception).{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Smit|2019|p=14,53}} Four years later, Mary appeared to the young [[Bernadette Soubirous]] at [[Loudes]] in southern France, to announce that she was the Immaculate Conception.{{sfn|Hammond|2003|p=602}}\n\nThe Archbishop of Paris had warned Pius that the Immaculate Conception \"could be proved neither from the Scriptures nor from tradition,\"{{sfn|Schaff|1931|p=unpaginated}} but ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' found it in the Ark of Salvation ([[Noah's Ark]]), [[Jacob's Ladder]], the [[Burning Bush]] at Sinai, the Enclosed Garden from the [[Song of Songs]], and many more.{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=35}} From this wealth of support the pope's advisors singled out [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]] as the basis for the Immaculate Conception: \"The most glorious Virgin ... was foretold by God when he said to the serpent: 'I will put enmity between you and the woman,'\"{{sfn|Manelli|1994|p=6-7}} a prophecy which reached fulfillment in the figure of the Woman in the [[Revelation of John]], crowned with stars and trampling the Dragon underfoot.{{sfn|Twomey|2008|p=73-74}} Luke 1:28, and specifically the phrase \"full of grace\" by which [[Gabriel]] greeted Mary, was another reference to her immaculate conception: \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction.\"{{sfn|German|2001|p=596}}\n\n==Other churches==\n{{further|Sinlessness of Mary}}\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nEastern Orthodoxy never accepted Augustine's ideas on original sin, and in consequence did not become involved in the later developments that took place in the Catholic world, including the Immaculate Conception. {{sfn|McGuckin|2012|p=unpaginated}}{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36}} When in 1894 Pope [[Leo XIII]] addressed the Eastern church in his encyclical ''Praeclara gratulationis'', the Ecumenical Patriarch Anthimos replied with an encyclical of his own in which he stigmatised the Immaculate Conception and papal infallibility as \"Roman novelties\" and called on the Roman church to return to the faith of the early centuries.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1981|p=90}} The Eastern Orthodox liturgy reveres Mary as Mother of God, Immaculate, Spotless, and Altogether Without Stain, so that as one contemporary Orthodox bishop puts it, \"the Latin dogma seems to us not so much erroneous as superfluous.\"{{sfn|Ware|1995|p=77}}\n\n===Protestantism===\nProtestants overwhelmingly condemned the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' as an exercise in papal power, and the doctrine itself as without foundation in Scripture,{{sfn|Herringer|2019|p=507}} for it denied that all had sinned and rested on a translation of Luke 1:28 (the \"full of grace\" passage) that the original Greek did not support.{{sfn|Hammond|2003|p=601}} With the exception of some Lutherans and Anglicans, most Protestants therefore teach that Mary was a sinner saved through grace like all believers.{{sfn|German|2001|p=596}}\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[Martin Luther]] showed an abiding devotion to Mary, including her sinlessness and sanctity, and Lutherans hold Mary in high esteem,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Villarreal |first1=Monica M. |title=The mother of our church? |url=https://www.livinglutheran.org/2013/04/mother-church/ |publisher=[[Living

Its celebration seems to have begun in the Eastern church in the 7th century and may have spread to Ireland by the 8th, although the earliest well-attested record in the Western church is from England early in the 11th.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It was suppressed there after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), and the first thorough exposition of the doctrine was a response to this suppression.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It continued to spread despite strong theological objections{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=128}} (in 1125 [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote to Lyons Cathedral to express his surprise and concern that it had recently begun to be observed there),{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} but in 1477 [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, placed it on the Roman calendar (i.e, list of Church festivals and observances).{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643}} [[Pius V]] suppressed it,{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=38}} but following the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' it was restored with the typically Franciscan phrase \"immaculate conception\" and given a formulary for the Mass, drawn largely from one composed for Sixtus IV, beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin...\". {{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643-644}}\n\nBy pontifical decree a number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception.

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the depiction of \"Our Lady\" seems to have been finally established by the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] in his  \"El arte de la pintura\" of 1649: a beautiful young girl of 12 or 13, wearing a white tunic and blue mantle, rays of light emanating from her head ringed by twelve stars and crowned by an imperial crown, the sun behind her and the moon beneath her feet.{{sfn|Moffitt|2001|p=676}} Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.{{sfn|Katz|Orsi|2001|p=98}} The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.{{sfn|Jenner|2009|p=3-9}}\n\n<br>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

(''S\u016bratu Maryam'') from a 9th-century [[Qur'an]], Turkey]]\n\nA saying of Mohammad recorded in the 9th century by the Muslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] quotes the Prophet saying that Satan touches all the descendants of Adam \"except Mary and her child\"; medieval Christian monks later used this passage to claim that the Quran supported the Immaculate Conception, with the result that Muhammad was even depicted in altarpieces between the 16th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|G\u00f6le|2016|p=115}} Islam, however, lacks the concept of original sin: according to the Quran he was immediately forgiven for his sin in Eden, which could therefore never have been passed to his descendants.{{sfn|Kritzeck|2015|p=120 fn.25}}\n\n==See also==\n[[File:San Pedro de las

The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\n\n==Role==\nPublication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the [[Internet]], rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as [[arXiv.org]] and to [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]. The sharing of preprints goes back to at least the 1960s, when the [[National Institutes of Health]] circulated biological preprints. After six years the use of these Information Exchange Groups was stopped, partially because journals stopped accepting submissions shared via these channels.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cobb |first1=Matthew |title=The prehistory of biology preprints: A\u00a0forgotten experiment from the 1960s |journal=PLOS Biology |date=16 November 2017 |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=e2003995 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995|pmid=29145518 |pmc=5690419 }}</ref>\n\nToday, in some journals, posting preprints may disqualify the research from submission for publication due to the [[Ingelfinger rule|Ingelfinger Rule]].

The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\n\n==Role==\nPublication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the [[Internet]], rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as [[arXiv.org]] and to [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]. The sharing of preprints goes back to at least the 1960s, when the [[National Institutes of Health]] circulated biological preprints.

LISSA was launched in 2017 as an open access repository for all materials created by those in LIS and allied fields, including work that happens outside the traditional realms of academia, such as oral histories, community works, code, data, and manuscripts. It is run by members of the library and archives community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the [[Open Science Framework]] to host materials.\n\n=== Physical sciences ===\nThe e-print archive [[arXiv]] (pronounced \"archive\") is one of the best-known preprint servers.

In his column in  ''[[Physics Today]]'', April 1992, [[David Mermin]] described Ginsparg's creation as potentially \"[[string theory]]'s greatest contribution to science\".

Upon graduation, K\u014dno worked with the [[Marubeni]] company. In 1967, Kono's political career began due to the death of his father.\n\n== Political career ==\n[[File:Murayama Government 19950808.jpg|thumb|left|Kono with members of [[Murayama Cabinet|Murayama Reshuffled Cabinet]] (at the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence]] on August 8, 1995)]]\nHe was Deputy Prime Minister from 1994 to 1995. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] and Murayama's successor [[Yoshir\u014d Mori]]. He is a member of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP). He was once President of the LDP from 1993 to 1995, and to date is the only LDP leader except for [[Sadakazu Tanigaki]] to have never served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]].
