This song was never performed live and it is one of the few songs on the album that are not in the vein of their standard rap songs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Song structure and lyrics==\nThe song is the shortest on the album, lasting just over two minutes long.\n\nLyrically, the song talks about the narrator (Ad-Rock)'s desire for women. He recalls an experience from two years before with a woman who had an interest in the narrator's bandmate MCA. MCA did not share her feelings and permitted the narrator to pursue her romantically. Ad-Rock takes the woman for a walk near a body of water and asks her out but rejects his proposal. She moves to a far away location but in the present day the narrator sees her back in town showing interest in his other bandmate, Mike D.\n\nThe arrangement is supplied by a drum machine beat and a simple melody on an electronic keyboard. Mike D and MCA provide wordless backing vocals reminiscent of [[doo wop]] that occasionally break into giggles at the song's humorous lyrics and Ad-Rock's exaggerated delivery.\n\n==GoldieBlox cover==\nIn 2013 the toy company [[GoldieBlox]] used the song with alternative lyrics in a video of a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] made primarily out of traditional girls' toys. The group accused the company of copyright infringement, and stated that Adam Yauch's last will prevented the use of their music in advertising. In November 2013, GoldieBlox countersued the Beastie Boys and producer Rick Rubin, saying the use of the song was a parody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/toy-company-sues-beastie-boys-rick-rubin-girls-parody-commercial/|date=2013-11-22|first1=Kyle|last1=McGovern|accessdate=2013-11-22|title=Toy Company Sues Beastie Boys, Rick Rubin Over 'Girls' Parody Commercial|website=[[Spin (magazine)|spin.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Eriq|last1=Gardner|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|\ntitle=Beastie Boys, 'Girls' Viral Video in Copyright Infringement Fight|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/beastie-boys-girls-viral-video-659308|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> In March 2014, the Beastie Boys settled out of court, with GoldieBlox issuing a public apology and making a donation to a charity of the band's choice.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beastie-boys-settle-lawsuit-over-girls-toy-commercial-20140318#ixzz2wTpcviSV</ref>\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1987)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[RIANZ Singles Chart|New Zealand Singles Chart]]\n|align=\"center\"|27\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=The Official Charts Company - Beastie Boys |work=[[Official Charts Company]] |publisher= |accessdate=2011-05-10 |df= }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|34\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MetroLyrics song|beastie-boys|girls}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n* {{YouTube|UFpe3Up9T_g|GoldieBlox, Rube Goldberg, & Beastie Boys \"Princess Machine\" (a concert for little girls)}}\n\n{{Beastie Boys}}\n{{Beastie Boys singles}}\n\n[[Category:1986 songs]]\n[[Category:1987 singles]]\n[[Category:Beastie Boys songs]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Rick Rubin]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Rick Rubin]]\n\n\n{{1980s-single-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox song\n| name       = Girls\n| cover      = Girls Beastie Boys.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Beastie Boys]]\n| album      = [[Licensed to Ill]]\n| B-side     = She's Crafty\n| released   = May 6, 1987\n| format     = [[7\"]], [[12\"]]\n| recorded   = 1986\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 2:14\n| label      = [[Def Jam]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n| writer     = Beastie Boys, [[Rick Rubin]]\n| producer   = Rick Rubin\n| prev_title = [[No Sleep till Brooklyn]]\n| prev_year  = 1987\n| next_title = [[Hey Ladies]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n}}\n\n\"'''Girls'''\" is a song by American hip hop group the [[Beastie Boys]], released in 1987 as well as the music video as the seventh and final single from their debut album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]''.

From 2010 to 2016 several of the novels were adapted for television, and other original stories were produced, under the series title ''[[DCI Banks]]'' with [[Stephen Tompkinson]] in the lead role.\n\n==Background==\nMost of the first dozen novels focused on crimes investigated by Banks. In the 1999 novel, ''In A Dry Season'', Banks and his wife, Sandra, are separated and eventually divorce. The character of Detective Sergeant (subsequently Detective Inspector) Annie Cabbot makes her first appearance as a member of Banks' team.  Subsequent novels have a sub-plot about the on-off romance between Banks and Cabbot.\n\nA colleague of Banks from his time in London, Detective Superintendent (later Chief Superintendent) Richard \"Dirty Dick\" Burgess, is another perennial character who appears in many of the novels.

From 2010 to 2016 several of the novels were adapted for television, and other original stories were produced, under the series title ''[[DCI Banks]]'' with [[Stephen Tompkinson]] in the lead role.\n\n==Background==\nMost of the first dozen novels focused on crimes investigated by Banks. In the 1999 novel, ''In A Dry Season'', Banks and his wife, Sandra, are separated and eventually divorce. The character of Detective Sergeant (subsequently Detective Inspector) Annie Cabbot makes her first appearance as a member of Banks' team.  Subsequent novels have a sub-plot about the on-off romance between Banks and Cabbot.\n\nA colleague of Banks from his time in London, Detective Superintendent (later Chief Superintendent) Richard \"Dirty Dick\" Burgess, is another perennial character who appears in many of the novels. Initially hostile to Banks when they first met, they become good friends over time and have established a natural (if still slightly edgy) rapport by the early 21st century.\n\nA detective inspector during his London period and a detective chief inspector in most of the books, Banks receives a promotion to detective superintendent at the time of \"When the Music's Over.\"<ref name=\"music_over\">{{cite web|title=When the Music\u2019s Over \u2013 2016|url=http://www.inspectorbanks.com/books/when-the-musics-over-2016/|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe Banks novels have won and been shortlisted for prestigious awards in crime fiction, including the [[Arthur Ellis Award]], the [[Anthony Award]], and the [[Edgar Award]].\n\n==Adaptation==\nIn July 2010, [[ITV Network|ITV]] commissioned a television adaptation of the novel ''[[Aftermath (Peter Robinson novel)|Aftermath]]'', with [[Stephen Tompkinson]] playing the role of Banks.

In 1537, they established the city of [[Asunci\u00f3n]],<ref>\"Paraguay: c\u00f3mo Asunci\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en \"madre\" de m\u00e1s de 70 ciudades de Sudam\u00e9rica hace 480 a\u00f1os\".

Paraguay was the center of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaran\u00ed people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.<ref>Caraman, Philip (1976): \"The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America\", New York: Seabury Press.</ref> However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict \u2013 the [[Chaco War]] \u2013 against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the \"democratic era\" of Paraguay.\n\nWith around seven million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]]. The Guarani culture is very influential and more than 90% of the people speak different forms of the Guarani language in addition to Spanish. Paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country has topped the \"world's happiest place\" charts because of the \"positive experiences\" lived and expressed by the population.<ref>{{cite news|title=World's Happiest Country?

One of the most common explanations is that it means \"water of the [[Payagua]] (a native tribe)\". Another meaning links the [[Guarani language|Guarani]] words ''para'' (\"river\") and ''guai'' (\"crown\"), meaning \"crowned river\". A third meaning may be ''para'' (\"river\"), ''gua'' (\"from\"), ''y'' (\"water\") meaning \"water that comes from the river\", referring to the bog in the north of the country, which is actually in Brazil.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Paraguay}}\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\nThe [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed]] had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.\n\n=== Colonization ===\nThe first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref> The Spanish explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial province of Paraguay]].\n\nAn attempt to create an autonomous Christian Indian nation<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\">{{cite web |url={{wdl|2581}} |title=Paraguariae Provinciae Soc.

They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]], in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\"/>\n\nIn western Paraguay, Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n=== Independence and rule of Francia===\n{{main|Independence of Paraguay}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], Paraguay's first dictator.]]\nParaguay overthrew the local Spanish administration on 14 May 1811. Paraguay's first dictator was [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]] who ruled Paraguay from 1814 until his death in 1840, with very little outside contact or influence. He intended to create a [[utopian]] society based on the French theorist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|''Social Contract'']].<ref>[http://warofthepacific.com/warofthetriplealliance.htm War of The Triple Alliance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807073919/http://warofthepacific.com/warofthetriplealliance.htm |date=7 August 2014 }}, War of the Pacific.

Because of Francia's restrictions of freedom, [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and several other Independence-era leaders in 1820 planned a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' against Francia, who discovered the plot and had its leaders either executed or imprisoned for life.\n\n===Rule of the L\u00f3pez family===\nAfter Francia's death in 1840, Paraguay was ruled by various military officers under a new ''[[military junta|junta]]'', until [[Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez]] (allegedly Rodr\u00edguez de Francia's nephew) came to power in 1841. L\u00f3pez modernized Paraguay and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a [[non-aggression pact]] with Argentina and officially declared independence of Paraguay in 1842. After L\u00f3pez's death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son, [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]].\n\nThe regime of the L\u00f3pez family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the L\u00f3pez family ruled the country as it would a large estate.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+py0019) \"Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez\"], Library of Congress Country Studies, December 1988.

The government's effort to isolate La\u00edno by exiling him in 1982 had backfired. On his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986, La\u00edno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred La\u00edno's return.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted La\u00edno to return to Asunci\u00f3n. La\u00edno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''m\u00edtines rel\u00e1mpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police.\n\nIn response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating \"sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law\". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. [[Hermes Rafael Saguier]], another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. La\u00edno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours. The government declared Stroessner's re-election with 89% of the vote.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/15/world/paraguayan-wins-his-eighth-term.html?scp=3&sq=Paraguay%20february%201988&st=cse \"Paraguayan Wins His Eighth Term\"], ''The New York Times'', 15 February 1988.</ref>\n\nThe opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual Colorado monopoly on the mass media. They noted that 53% of those polled indicated that there was an \"uneasiness\" in Paraguayan society. 74% believed that the political situation needed changes, including 45% who wanted a substantial or total change. Finally, 31% stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the February elections. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Stroessner's overthrow, post-1989===\nOn 3 February 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by General [[Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez (President)|Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez]]. As president, Rodr\u00edguez instituted political, legal, and economic reforms and initiated a ''rapprochement'' with the international community.

In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.\n\nWith support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.\n\nOviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Ra\u00fal Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis Mar\u00eda Arga\u00f1a]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters. This increased opposition to Cubas, who resigned on 28 March.

Their candidate was Minister of Education [[Blanca Ovelar]], the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in Paraguayan history. After sixty years of Colorado rule, voters chose [[Fernando Lugo]], a former Roman Catholic Bishop and not a professional politician in civil government, and a member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Paraguay's largest opposition party. Lugo was an adherent of [[liberation theology]]. Lugo achieved a historic victory in Paraguay's presidential election, defeating the ruling party candidate, and ending 61 years of conservative rule.

The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19\u00b0]] and [[28th parallel south|28\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54\u00b0]] and [[63rd meridian west|63\u00b0W]].\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}\nThe overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the north, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.\n\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).\n\nRainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year.

Both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Guarani language|Guaran\u00ed]] are official languages. The Guaran\u00ed language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous Guaran\u00ed culture that has endured in Paraguay. Guaran\u00ed claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaran\u00ed is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaran\u00ed. While Guaran\u00ed is still widely spoken, Spanish is generally given a preferential treatment in government, business, media and education as one of South America's [[lingua franca]]s.<ref name=\"ethnologue-list\">[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/gug Paraguayan Guaran\u00ed], Ethnologue</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paraguay |url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/PY-language.htm |title=The Languages spoken in Paraguay |publisher=Studycountry.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitparaguay.net/paraguay-guide/languages-paraguay.html |title=Languages of Paraguay |publisher=VisitParaguay.net |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Romero|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |title=In Paraguay, Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power |work=The New York Times |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages of Paraguay\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Languages\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] |Orange|90}}\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|Blue| 87}} \n}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Largest cities===\n{{Largest cities of Paraguay}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Music of Paraguay|Cinema of Paraguay}}\nParaguay's cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] women. Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran\u00ed. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival]]\nThis cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'\u00ed'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''\u00f1andut\u00ed''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the time of the birth of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Maz\u00f3]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.\n\nInside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, [[godparent]]s have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay \u2013 Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}\nSport in Paraguay is an important part of the country's national culture.

In 1537, they established the city of [[Asunci\u00f3n]],<ref>\"Paraguay: c\u00f3mo Asunci\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en \"madre\" de m\u00e1s de 70 ciudades de Sudam\u00e9rica hace 480 a\u00f1os\".

Paraguay was the center of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaran\u00ed people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.<ref>Caraman, Philip (1976): \"The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America\", New York: Seabury Press.</ref> However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict \u2013 the [[Chaco War]] \u2013 against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the \"democratic era\" of Paraguay.\n\nWith around seven million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]]. The Guarani culture is very influential and more than 90% of the people speak different forms of the Guarani language in addition to Spanish. Paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country has topped the \"world's happiest place\" charts because of the \"positive experiences\" lived and expressed by the population.<ref>{{cite news|title=World's Happiest Country?

One of the most common explanations is that it means \"water of the [[Payagua]] (a native tribe)\". Another meaning links the [[Guarani language|Guarani]] words ''para'' (\"river\") and ''guai'' (\"crown\"), meaning \"crowned river\". A third meaning may be ''para'' (\"river\"), ''gua'' (\"from\"), ''y'' (\"water\") meaning \"water that comes from the river\", referring to the bog in the north of the country, which is actually in Brazil.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Paraguay}}\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\nThe [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed]] had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.\n\n=== Colonization ===\nThe first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref> The Spanish explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial province of Paraguay]].\n\nAn attempt to create an autonomous Christian Indian nation<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\">{{cite web |url={{wdl|2581}} |title=Paraguariae Provinciae Soc. Jesu cum Adiacentibg. Novissima Descriptio |language=Latin |trans-title=A Current Description of the Province of the Society of Jesus in Paraguay with Neighboring Areas |work=World Digital Library |date=1732 }}</ref> was undertaken by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missions and settlements in this part of South America in the eighteenth century, which included portions of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]], in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\"/>\n\nIn western Paraguay, Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n=== Independence and rule of Francia===\n{{main|Independence of Paraguay}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], Paraguay's first dictator.]]\nParaguay overthrew the local Spanish administration on 14 May 1811.

On his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986, La\u00edno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred La\u00edno's return.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted La\u00edno to return to Asunci\u00f3n. La\u00edno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''m\u00edtines rel\u00e1mpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police.\n\nIn response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating \"sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law\". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. [[Hermes Rafael Saguier]], another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. La\u00edno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours.

In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.\n\nWith support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.\n\nOviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Ra\u00fal Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis Mar\u00eda Arga\u00f1a]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters.

The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19\u00b0]] and [[28th parallel south|28\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54\u00b0]] and [[63rd meridian west|63\u00b0W]].\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}\nThe overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the north, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.\n\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).\n\nRainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year. The rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly, contributing to the aridity of the area.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Paraguay |Human rights in Paraguay|Foreign relations of Paraguay}}\nParaguay is a [[representative democratic]] republic, with a multi-party system and [[separation of powers]] in three branches.

Both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Guarani language|Guaran\u00ed]] are official languages. The Guaran\u00ed language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous Guaran\u00ed culture that has endured in Paraguay. Guaran\u00ed claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaran\u00ed is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaran\u00ed. While Guaran\u00ed is still widely spoken, Spanish is generally given a preferential treatment in government, business, media and education as one of South America's [[lingua franca]]s.<ref name=\"ethnologue-list\">[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/gug Paraguayan Guaran\u00ed], Ethnologue</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paraguay |url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/PY-language.htm |title=The Languages spoken in Paraguay |publisher=Studycountry.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitparaguay.net/paraguay-guide/languages-paraguay.html |title=Languages of Paraguay |publisher=VisitParaguay.net |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Romero|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |title=In Paraguay, Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power |work=The New York Times |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages of Paraguay\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Languages\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] |Orange|90}}\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|Blue| 87}} \n}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Largest cities===\n{{Largest cities of Paraguay}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Music of Paraguay|Cinema of Paraguay}}\nParaguay's cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] women. Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran\u00ed. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival]]\nThis cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'\u00ed'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''\u00f1andut\u00ed''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the time of the birth of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Maz\u00f3]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.\n\nInside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, [[godparent]]s have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay \u2013 Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}\nSport in Paraguay is an important part of the country's national culture.

South Korea has an embassy in [[Manila]] while the Philippines has an embassy in [[Seoul]].\n\n==History==\nBilateral relations between South Korea and the Philippines were established on March 3, 1949 upon the recognition of Republic of Korea as a sovereign state by the Philippines. The Philippines was the fifth state to recognize the Republic of Korea and the first [[ASEAN]] country to establish relations with South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philembassy-seoul.com/rp_rk_relations.asp |title=Philippines-South Korea Relations |publisher=Philembassy-seoul.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref><ref>http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=113844</ref>\n\n==Economic relations==\n[[File:KOCIS Korea President Park Philippines President Aquino 06 (10437103074).jpg|thumb|250px|[[President of South Korea|President]] [[Park Geun-hye]] and [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]] in [[Cheong Wa Dae]]]]\nSouth Korea is the sixth biggest trading partner of the Philippines, while the Philippines is the third most attractive Southeast Asian country for South Korean investors in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/business/top-business-news/31916-ph-seeks-deeper-trade-ties-with-south-korea |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008033822/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/business/top-business-news/31916-ph-seeks-deeper-trade-ties-with-south-korea |archivedate=October 8, 2012 }}</ref> South Korea also provides the biggest tourist market for the Philippines.

These planes have since been decommissioned, but not before seeing ample use in the latter\u2018s domestic military operations against communist and Muslim separatist insurgents. In addition to this, South Korea has also donated a number of [[Cessna T-41 Mescalero|T-41]] trainer planes.\n\nIn 2014, South Korea donated the ROKS Chungju, a ''Pohang''-class corvette, to the [[Philippine Navy]]. She was handed over, refitted, and commissioned as the [[BRP Conrado Yap (PS-39)]] on 5 August 2019.\n<ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-donates-philippine-2014-6</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/238091-philippines-welcomes-most-powerful-warship-conrado-yap</ref>\n\nThe South Korean government also actively fulfills contracts for the Philippines for a variety of military hardware. These range from [[Daewoo Precision Industries K3|small arms]], [[Kia KLTV|armored tactical vehicles]], missile frigates, to multirole fighters.\n\nIn 2017, South Korea delivered the last batch of the 12 [[FA-50|FA-50 Fighting Eagle]] multirole fighters ordered by the Philippines. <ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/166409-philippines-fighter-jets-complete</ref> \n\nOn 16 October 2018, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] began construction on the future [[BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150)]], the first missile frigate of her [[Jose Rizal-class frigate|class]] and one of two that had been placed on order by the Philippine government. She was launched on 23 May 2019. Construction on the next missile frigate, [[BRP Antonio Luna (FF-151)]], began on the same day.

These planes have since been decommissioned, but not before seeing ample use in the latter\u2018s domestic military operations against communist and Muslim separatist insurgents. In addition to this, South Korea has also donated a number of [[Cessna T-41 Mescalero|T-41]] trainer planes.\n\nIn 2014, South Korea donated the ROKS Chungju, a ''Pohang''-class corvette, to the [[Philippine Navy]]. She was handed over, refitted, and commissioned as the [[BRP Conrado Yap (PS-39)]] on 5 August 2019.\n<ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-donates-philippine-2014-6</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/238091-philippines-welcomes-most-powerful-warship-conrado-yap</ref>\n\nThe South Korean government also actively fulfills contracts for the Philippines for a variety of military hardware. These range from [[Daewoo Precision Industries K3|small arms]], [[Kia KLTV|armored tactical vehicles]], missile frigates, to multirole fighters.\n\nIn 2017, South Korea delivered the last batch of the 12 [[FA-50|FA-50 Fighting Eagle]] multirole fighters ordered by the Philippines. <ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/166409-philippines-fighter-jets-complete</ref> \n\nOn 16 October 2018, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] began construction on the future [[BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150)]], the first missile frigate of her [[Jose Rizal-class frigate|class]] and one of two that had been placed on order by the Philippine government. She was launched on 23 May 2019. Construction on the next missile frigate, [[BRP Antonio Luna (FF-151)]], began on the same day.

His debut album, ''[[The Mammoth Tusk]]'', was released in 2009.  The album was considered an international advancement for local Arabic hip-hop as it featured support from a number of high-profile acts including Damon Albarn (Gorillaz/Blur), De La Soul, The Rza / Gza / Cilvaringz (Wu-Tang Clan), Focus... (Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment), Rude Jude / Lord Sear (Shade 45), and 'Arap' band-mate Shadia Mansour.\n\n==Career==\n\nJawaad's presence within the music industry is spread out across both the MENA region and Internationally.\n\nIn addition to his Solo-Career, Jawaad is a founding member of the Arab Hip-Hop Collective known as 'Arap', which consisted of - in addition to himself- Mohalim, Cilvaringz, Ledr P, and Shadia Mansour.

Salah Edin, who founded the group with Eslam and Cilvaringz, left the group in 2009, and the group itself ceased to record soon after.  Though the band never released a studio album, the momentum they gave the Arab hip-hop movement through their tours and limited releases was one of the most anticipated and important developments for the genre.\n  \nJawaad's first international tour was with Wu-Tang Killa Beez, as he was brought into that fold by his longtime associate, partner and manager Cilvaringz.  It was this that led to his collaboration with Rza and Gza on his album song 'So Real' ft. Shadia Mansour. His most recent endeavor with Wu-Tang is his Co-Executive Producer credits on the single-copy, art piece - Wu-Tang Clan album \"Once Upon A Time in Shaolin\", which made it into the Guinness Book of Records, as most valuable album. In addition to this, Jawaad also featured on Cilvaringz Album, \"I\".\n\nJawaad has also toured with a number of other notable acts including Gorillaz, The Good The Bad and The Queen, Fun-da-mental, and Africa Express. He is an avid supporter of MENA region music and uses his influence to promote various artists from the region, while also managing acts including Mais Harb and Layali Project which he successfully signed onto Universal Music.\n\nJawaad was instrumental in bringing long time friend and musical collaborator Damon Albarn to Syria to record with the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music, and recordings from these sessions made it onto the Gorillaz album 'Plastic Beach', with the Orchestra alongside Albarn and Jawaad eventually touring under the Africa Express banner in 2016 across major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde.\n\nJawaad also played an integral role in promoting Arab artists internationally\n\n==Personal life==\n\nJawaad is father of three children and currently resides in the Dubai.   After working as Executive Director for Global Gumbo Group, an LA and Dubai based company founded by Quincy Jones, he is currently Spotifys' Head of Artist & Label Marketing across the Middle East and North Africa. He continues to consult within the industry, and has lectured at Cambridge University's Judge Business School.\n\nSources: https://web.archive.org/web/20150119145046/http://www.globalgumbogroup.com/index.php/the-team/\n\n<ref>{{cite news |last=Allers |first=Jackson |url=http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6991-eslam-jawaad-old-school-arab-mc-comes-correct |title=Eslam Jawaad: an old-school Arab MC comes correct |work=Menassat |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n* ''Eslam Jawaad - [[The Mammoth Tusk]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]] - [[Mr. Whippy (song)|Mr. Whippy]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Cilvaringz]] - [[I (Civalringz album)|I]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Gorillaz]] - [[Plastic Beach]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Gorillaz]] - [[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood (Eslam Jawaad Version- Live)]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Fun-Da-Mental]] - [[All is War (The Benefits of G-Had)]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Visionary Underground]] - [[Keep The Grime On]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Souterrain Productions]] - [[50 MC's Vol. 2]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[7th Century Records]] - [[Palestine The Album]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Darwish (musician)|Darwish]] - [[7th Sky]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Darwish (musician)|Darwish]] - [[Today's Democracy]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Salah Edin]] - [[HORR (album)|HORR]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Salah Edin]] - [[The Official Mix Tape]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Peace is my religion, music is my weapon]] - [[Mixtape (mixtape)|Mixtape]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Peace is my religion, music is my weapon]] - [[Palestine Vol. 2]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Lowkey]] - [[Long Live Palestine 2]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Nickodemus]] - [[A Dubai Minute]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Le Jakal]] - [[Alchemistas]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[UK Apache]] - [[Concrete Jungle (UK Apache Album)|Concrete Jungle]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Fun-Da-Mental]] - [[A Philosophy of Nothing]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Gorillaz]] - [[White Flag - Live version taken from Africa Express Presents: The Orchestra of Syrian Musicians & Guests]]'' (2016)\n\nHis song \"Pivot Widdit\" was used in the Dubai film ''City of Life'', and \"Siasa\" in Hollywood blockbuster ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fgrg \n* https://www.arabianbusiness.com/media/413952-spotify-appoints-lebanese-syrian-rapper-to-manage-middle-east-artists \n* https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085349/http://eslam-jawaad.musikear.com/the-mammoth-tusk\n* https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/eslam-jawaad--preaching-to-the-unconverted-1655013.html\n* http://www.africaexpress.co.uk/\n* http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/creating-music-fit-for-museums\n* http://www.dubainight.com/dubai/casa-latina/thursday-march-20-boombox-presents-mohalim-arap-supported-by-shadia-mansour-eslam-jawaad,1,767820.html\n* https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128846005\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jawaad, Eslam}}\n[[Category:Lebanese rappers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=January 2012}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n|name = Eslam Jawaad \n|Birth name: Wissam Khodur\n|origin = [[Lebanon]]/[[Syria]] \n|genre = [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[political hip hop]], [[Arabic hip hop]], [[trip hop]]\n| background=solo_singer\n}}\n\n'''Wissam Khodur''' ({{lang-ar|'''\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0636\u0631'''}}), better known as '''Eslam Jawaad''' ({{lang-ar|'''\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f'''}}), is a rapper of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]]-[[Syria]]n origin.

His most recent endeavor with Wu-Tang is his Co-Executive Producer credits on the single-copy, art piece - Wu-Tang Clan album \"Once Upon A Time in Shaolin\", which made it into the Guinness Book of Records, as most valuable album. In addition to this, Jawaad also featured on Cilvaringz Album, \"I\".\n\nJawaad has also toured with a number of other notable acts including Gorillaz, The Good The Bad and The Queen, Fun-da-mental, and Africa Express. He is an avid supporter of MENA region music and uses his influence to promote various artists from the region, while also managing acts including Mais Harb and Layali Project which he successfully signed onto Universal Music.\n\nJawaad was instrumental in bringing long time friend and musical collaborator Damon Albarn to Syria to record with the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music, and recordings from these sessions made it onto the Gorillaz album 'Plastic Beach', with the Orchestra alongside Albarn and Jawaad eventually touring under the Africa Express banner in 2016 across major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde.\n\nJawaad also played an integral role in promoting Arab artists interationally\n\n==Personal life==\n\nJawaad is father of three children and currently resides in the Dubai.   After working as Executive Director for Global Gumbo Group, an LA and Dubai based company founded by Quincy Jones, he is currently Spotifys' Head of Artist & Label Marketing across the Middle East and North Africa. He continues to consult within the industry, and has lectured at Cambridge University's Judge Business School.\n\nSources: https://web.archive.org/web/20150119145046/http://www.globalgumbogroup.com/index.php/the-team/\n\n<ref>{{cite news |last=Allers |first=Jackson |url=http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6991-eslam-jawaad-old-school-arab-mc-comes-correct |title=Eslam Jawaad: an old-school Arab MC comes correct |work=Menassat |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n* ''Eslam Jawaad - [[The Mammoth Tusk]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]] - [[Mr. Whippy (song)|Mr. Whippy]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Cilvaringz]] - [[I (Civalringz album)|I]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Gorillaz]] - [[Plastic Beach]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Gorillaz]] - [[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood (Eslam Jawaad Version- Live)]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Fun-Da-Mental]] - [[All is War (The Benefits of G-Had)]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Visionary Underground]] - [[Keep The Grime On]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Souterrain Productions]] - [[50 MC's Vol. 2]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[7th Century Records]] - [[Palestine The Album]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Darwish (musician)|Darwish]] - [[7th Sky]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Darwish (musician)|Darwish]] - [[Today's Democracy]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Salah Edin]] - [[HORR (album)|HORR]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Salah Edin]] - [[The Official Mix Tape]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Peace is my religion, music is my weapon]] - [[Mixtape (mixtape)|Mixtape]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Peace is my religion, music is my weapon]] - [[Palestine Vol. 2]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Lowkey]] - [[Long Live Palestine 2]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Nickodemus]] - [[A Dubai Minute]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Le Jakal]] - [[Alchemistas]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[UK Apache]] - [[Concrete Jungle (UK Apache Album)|Concrete Jungle]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Fun-Da-Mental]] - [[A Philosophy of Nothing]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Gorillaz]] - [[White Flag - Live version taken from Africa Express Presents: The Orchestra of Syrian Musicians & Guests]]'' (2016)\n\nHis song \"Pivot Widdit\" was used in the Dubai film ''City of Life'', and \"Siasa\" in Hollywood blockbuster ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fgrg \n* https://www.arabianbusiness.com/media/413952-spotify-appoints-lebanese-syrian-rapper-to-manage-middle-east-artists \n* https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085349/http://eslam-jawaad.musikear.com/the-mammoth-tusk\n* https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/eslam-jawaad--preaching-to-the-unconverted-1655013.html\n* http://www.africaexpress.co.uk/\n* http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/creating-music-fit-for-museums\n* http://www.dubainight.com/dubai/casa-latina/thursday-march-20-boombox-presents-mohalim-arap-supported-by-shadia-mansour-eslam-jawaad,1,767820.html\n( https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128846005\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jawaad, Eslam}}\n[[Category:Lebanese rappers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "GoingBatty", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: high profile \u2192 high-profile, interationally \u2192 internationally", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eslam_Jawaad"}

{"title_page": "Ray transfer matrix analysis", "text_new": "{{Short description|Ray tracing technique}}\n'''Ray transfer matrix analysis''' (also known as '''ABCD matrix analysis''') is a mathematical form for performing [[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] calculations in sufficiently simple problems which can be solved considering only paraxial rays.  Each optical element (surface, interface, mirror, or beam travel) is described by a 2\u00d72 ''ray transfer [[matrix (math)|matrix]]'' which operates on a [[vector space|vector]] describing an incoming [[ray (optics)|light ray]] to calculate the outgoing ray. Multiplication of the successive matrices thus yields a concise ray transfer matrix describing the entire optical system. The same mathematics is also used in [[accelerator physics]] to track particles through the magnet installations of a [[particle accelerator]], see [[beam optics|Electron optics]].\n\nThis technique, as described below, is derived using the ''[[paraxial approximation]]'', which requires that all ray directions (directions normal to the wavefronts) are at small angles \u03b8 relative to the [[optical axis]] of the system, such that the approximation <math>\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta</math> remains valid. A small \u03b8 further implies that the transverse extent of the ray bundles (''x'' and ''y'') is small compared to the length of the optical system (thus \"paraxial\"). Since a decent imaging system where this is ''not'' the case for all rays must still focus the paraxial rays correctly, this matrix method will properly describe the positions of focal planes and magnifications, however [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] still need to be evaluated using full [[Ray tracing (physics)#Optical design|ray-tracing]] techniques.<ref>Extension of matrix methods to tracing (non-paraxial) meridional rays is included [http://spie.org/Documents/ETOP/1991/389_1.pdf here].</ref>\n\n== Definition of the ray transfer matrix ==\n[[File:RayTransferMatrixDefinitions.svg|thumb|300px|In ray transfer (ABCD) matrix analysis, an optical element (here, a thick lens) gives a transformation between <math>(x_1, \\theta_1)</math> at the input plane and <math>(x_2, \\theta_2)</math> when the ray arrives at the output plane.]]\n\nThe ray tracing technique is based on two reference planes, called the ''input'' and ''output'' planes, each perpendicular to the optical axis of the system.  At any point along the optical train an optical axis is defined corresponding to a central ray; that central ray is propagated to define the optical axis further in the optical train which need not be in the same physical direction (such as when bent by a prism or mirror). The transverse directions ''x'' and ''y'' (below we only consider the ''x'' direction) are then defined to be orthogonal to the optical axes applying. A light ray enters a component crossing its input plane at a distance ''x''<sub>1</sub> from the optical axis, traveling in a direction that makes an angle \u03b8<sub>1</sub> with the optical axis. After propagation to the output plane that ray is found at a distance ''x''<sub>2</sub> from the optical axis and at an angle \u03b8<sub>2</sub> with respect to it.  ''n''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> are the [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]] of the media in the input and output plane, respectively.\n\nThe ABCD matrix representing a component or system relates the output ray to the input according to\n\n:<math> {x_2 \\choose \\theta_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix}{x_1 \\choose \\theta_1}, </math>\n\nwhere the values of the 4 matrix elements are thus given by\n\n:<math>A = {x_2 \\over x_1 } \\bigg|_{\\theta_1 = 0} \\qquad B = {x_2 \\over \\theta_1 } \\bigg|_{x_1 = 0},</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>C = {\\theta_2 \\over x_1 } \\bigg|_{\\theta_1 = 0} \\qquad D = {\\theta_2 \\over \\theta_1 } \\bigg|_{x_1 = 0}.</math>\n\nThis relates the ''ray vectors'' at the input and output planes by the ''ray transfer matrix'' (RTM) '''M''', which represents the optical component or system present between the two reference planes.  A [[thermodynamics]] argument based on the [[blackbody]] radiation can be used to show that the [[determinant]] of a RTM is the ratio of the indices of refraction:\n\n:<math>\\det(\\mathbf{M}) = AD - BC = {   n_1  \\over  n_2 }.  </math>\n\nAs a result, if the input and output planes are located within the same medium, or within two different media which happen to have identical indices of refraction, then the determinant of '''M''' is simply equal to 1.\n\nA different convention<ref>{{cite book\n |title= Introduction to matrix methods in optics\n |last1= Gerrard |first1= Anthony\n |last2= Burch |first2 = James M.\n |year=1994\n |publisher=Courier Dover\n |location=\n |isbn= 9780486680446\n |pages=\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naUSNojPwOgC\n}}</ref> for the ray vectors can be employed. Instead of using  \u03b8\u2248sin \u03b8, the second element of the ray vector is ''n'' sin \u03b8, which is proportional not to the ray angle ''per se'' but to the transverse component of the [[wave vector]].\nThis alters the ABCD matrices given in the table below where refraction at an interface is involved.\n\nThe use of transfer matrices in this manner parallels the 2\u00d72 matrices describing electronic [[two-port network#ABCD-parameters|two-port networks]], particularly various so-called ABCD matrices which can similarly be multiplied to solve for cascaded systems.\n\n== Some examples ==\n* For example, if there is free space between the two planes, the ray transfer matrix is given by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>,\n\nwhere ''d'' is the separation distance (measured along the optical axis) between the two reference planes. The ray transfer equation thus becomes:\n\n:<math> {x_2 \\choose \\theta_2} = \\mathbf{S}{x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} </math>,\n\nand this relates the parameters of the two rays as:\n\n:<math> \\begin{matrix} x_2 & = & x_1 + d\\theta_1 \\\\\n\\theta_2 & = & \\theta_1 \\end{matrix} </math>\n\n* Another simple example is that of a [[thin lens]]. Its RTM is given by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>,\n\nwhere ''f'' is the [[focal length]] of the lens. To describe combinations of optical components, ray transfer matrices may be multiplied together to obtain an overall RTM for the compound optical system. For the example of free space of length ''d'' followed by a lens of focal length ''f'':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1-\\frac{d}{f} \\end{pmatrix} </math>.\n\nNote that, since the multiplication of matrices is non-[[commutative]], this is not the same RTM as that for a lens followed by free space:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{SL} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\frac{d}{f} & d \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>.\n\nThus the matrices must be ordered appropriately, with the last matrix premultiplying the second last, and so on until the first matrix is premultiplied by the second. Other matrices can be constructed to represent interfaces with media of different [[refractive index|refractive indices]], reflection from [[mirror]]s, etc.\n\n== Table of ray transfer matrices ==\n'''for simple optical components'''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n|- style=\"background-color: #AAFFCC\"\n!

At its simplest, an optical resonator consists of two identical facing mirrors of 100% [[reflectivity]] and radius of [[curvature]] ''R'', separated by some distance ''d''. For the purposes of ray tracing, this is equivalent to a series of identical thin lenses of focal length ''f''=''R''/2, each separated from the next by length ''d''. This construction is known as a ''lens equivalent duct'' or ''lens equivalent [[waveguide]]''. The RTM of each section of the waveguide is, as above,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{M} =\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1-\\frac{d}{f} \\end{pmatrix} </math>.\n\nRTM analysis can now be used to determine the ''stability'' of the waveguide (and equivalently, the resonator). That is, it can be determined under what conditions light travelling down the waveguide will be periodically refocussed and stay within the waveguide. To do so, we can find all the \"eigenrays\" of the system: the input ray vector at each of the mentioned sections of the waveguide times a real or complex factor \u03bb is equal to the output one. This gives:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{M}{x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} = {x_2 \\choose \\theta_2} = \\lambda {x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} </math>.\n\nwhich is an [[eigenvalue]] equation:\n\n:<math> \\left[ \\mathbf{M} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I} \\right] {x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} = 0 </math>,\n\nwhere '''I''' is the 2x2 [[identity matrix]].\n\nWe proceed to calculate the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{det}  \\left[  \\mathbf{M} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I} \\right] = 0  </math>,\n\nleading to the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]]\n\n:<math> \\lambda^2 - \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{M}) \\lambda + \\operatorname{det}( \\mathbf{M}) = 0 </math>,\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>  \\operatorname{tr} ( \\mathbf{M} )   =    A + D   =   2 - { d \\over f }  </math>\n\nis the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the RTM, and\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{det}(\\mathbf{M}) = AD - BC  = 1 </math>\n\nis the [[determinant]] of the RTM.  After one common substitution we have:\n\n:<math> \\lambda^2 - 2g \\lambda + 1 = 0  </math>,\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> g \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   { \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{M}) \\over 2 } = 1 - { d \\over 2 f } </math>\n\nis the ''stability parameter''. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation. From the [[Quadratic equation#Quadratic formula and its derivation|quadratic formula]] we find\n\n:<math> \\lambda_{\\pm}  =  g \\pm \\sqrt{g^2 - 1} \\, </math>\n\nNow, consider a ray after ''N'' passes through the system:\n\n:<math> {x_N \\choose \\theta_N} = \\lambda^N {x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} </math>.\n\nIf the waveguide is stable, no ray should stray arbitrarily far from the main axis, that is, \u03bb<sup>N</sup> must not grow without limit. Suppose <math> g^2 > 1</math>. Then both eigenvalues are real. Since <math> \\lambda_+ \\lambda_- = 1</math>, one of them has to be bigger than 1 (in absolute value), which implies that the ray which corresponds to this eigenvector would not converge. Therefore, in a stable waveguide, <math> g^2 </math> \u2264 1,  and the eigenvalues can be represented by complex numbers:\n\n:<math> \\lambda_{\\pm} = g \\pm i \\sqrt{1 - g^2} = \\cos(\\phi) \\pm i \\sin(\\phi) =  e^{\\pm i \\phi} </math>,\n\nwith the substitution g = cos(\u03d5).\n\nFor <math> g^2 < 1 </math> let <math> r_+ </math> and <math> r_- </math> be the eigenvectors with respect to the eigenvalues <math> \\lambda_+ </math> and <math> \\lambda_- </math> respectively, which span all the vector space because they are orthogonal, the latter due to <math>\\lambda_+</math> \u2260 <math>\\lambda_- </math>. The input vector can therefore be written as\n\n:<math> c_+ r_+ + c_- r_-  </math>,\n\nfor some constants <math> c_+ </math> and <math> c_- </math>.\n\nAfter ''N'' waveguide sectors, the output reads\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{M}^N (c_+ r_+ + c_- r_-) = \\lambda_+^N c_+ r_+ + \\lambda_-^N c_- r_- = e^{i N \\phi} c_+ r_+ + e^{- i N \\phi} c_- r_- </math>,\n\nwhich represents a periodic function.\n\n== Ray transfer matrices for Gaussian beams ==\nThe same matrices can also be used to calculate the evolution of [[Gaussian beam]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian vaziri|first1=M R|title=New ducting model for analyzing the Gaussian beam propagation in nonlinear Kerr media and its application to spatial self-phase modulations|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=035202|doi=10.1088/2040-8978/15/3/035202|bibcode=2013JOpt...15c5202R|year=2013}}</ref> propagating through optical components described by the same transmission matrices.

Each optical element (surface, interface, mirror, or beam travel) is described by a 2\u00d72 ''ray transfer [[matrix (math)|matrix]]'' which operates on a [[vector space|vector]] describing an incoming [[ray (optics)|light ray]] to calculate the outgoing ray. Multiplication of the successive matrices thus yields a concise ray transfer matrix describing the entire optical system. The same mathematics is also used in [[accelerator physics]] to track particles through the magnet installations of a [[particle accelerator]], see [[beam optics]].\n\nThis technique, as described below, is derived using the ''[[paraxial approximation]]'', which requires that all ray directions (directions normal to the wavefronts) are at small angles \u03b8 relative to the [[optical axis]] of the system, such that the approximation <math>\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta</math> remains valid. A small \u03b8 further implies that the transverse extent of the ray bundles (''x'' and ''y'') is small compared to the length of the optical system (thus \"paraxial\"). Since a decent imaging system where this is ''not'' the case for all rays must still focus the paraxial rays correctly, this matrix method will properly describe the positions of focal planes and magnifications, however [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] still need to be evaluated using full [[Ray tracing (physics)#Optical design|ray-tracing]] techniques.<ref>Extension of matrix methods to tracing (non-paraxial) meridional rays is included [http://spie.org/Documents/ETOP/1991/389_1.pdf here].</ref>\n\n== Definition of the ray transfer matrix ==\n[[File:RayTransferMatrixDefinitions.svg|thumb|300px|In ray transfer (ABCD) matrix analysis, an optical element (here, a thick lens) gives a transformation between <math>(x_1, \\theta_1)</math> at the input plane and <math>(x_2, \\theta_2)</math> when the ray arrives at the output plane.]]\n\nThe ray tracing technique is based on two reference planes, called the ''input'' and ''output'' planes, each perpendicular to the optical axis of the system.  At any point along the optical train an optical axis is defined corresponding to a central ray; that central ray is propagated to define the optical axis further in the optical train which need not be in the same physical direction (such as when bent by a prism or mirror). The transverse directions ''x'' and ''y'' (below we only consider the ''x'' direction) are then defined to be orthogonal to the optical axes applying. A light ray enters a component crossing its input plane at a distance ''x''<sub>1</sub> from the optical axis, traveling in a direction that makes an angle \u03b8<sub>1</sub> with the optical axis. After propagation to the output plane that ray is found at a distance ''x''<sub>2</sub> from the optical axis and at an angle \u03b8<sub>2</sub> with respect to it.  ''n''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> are the [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]] of the media in the input and output plane, respectively.\n\nThe ABCD matrix representing a component or system relates the output ray to the input according to\n\n:<math> {x_2 \\choose \\theta_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix}{x_1 \\choose \\theta_1}, </math>\n\nwhere the values of the 4 matrix elements are thus given by\n\n:<math>A = {x_2 \\over x_1 } \\bigg|_{\\theta_1 = 0} \\qquad B = {x_2 \\over \\theta_1 } \\bigg|_{x_1 = 0},</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>C = {\\theta_2 \\over x_1 } \\bigg|_{\\theta_1 = 0} \\qquad D = {\\theta_2 \\over \\theta_1 } \\bigg|_{x_1 = 0}.</math>\n\nThis relates the ''ray vectors'' at the input and output planes by the ''ray transfer matrix'' (RTM) '''M''', which represents the optical component or system present between the two reference planes.  A [[thermodynamics]] argument based on the [[blackbody]] radiation can be used to show that the [[determinant]] of a RTM is the ratio of the indices of refraction:\n\n:<math>\\det(\\mathbf{M}) = AD - BC = {   n_1  \\over  n_2 }.  </math>\n\nAs a result, if the input and output planes are located within the same medium, or within two different media which happen to have identical indices of refraction, then the determinant of '''M''' is simply equal to 1.\n\nA different convention<ref>{{cite book\n |title= Introduction to matrix methods in optics\n |last1= Gerrard |first1= Anthony\n |last2= Burch |first2 = James M.\n |year=1994\n |publisher=Courier Dover\n |location=\n |isbn= 9780486680446\n |pages=\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naUSNojPwOgC\n}}</ref> for the ray vectors can be employed. Instead of using  \u03b8\u2248sin \u03b8, the second element of the ray vector is ''n'' sin \u03b8, which is proportional not to the ray angle ''per se'' but to the transverse component of the [[wave vector]].\nThis alters the ABCD matrices given in the table below where refraction at an interface is involved.\n\nThe use of transfer matrices in this manner parallels the 2\u00d72 matrices describing electronic [[two-port network#ABCD-parameters|two-port networks]], particularly various so-called ABCD matrices which can similarly be multiplied to solve for cascaded systems.\n\n== Some examples ==\n* For example, if there is free space between the two planes, the ray transfer matrix is given by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>,\n\nwhere ''d'' is the separation distance (measured along the optical axis) between the two reference planes. The ray transfer equation thus becomes:\n\n:<math> {x_2 \\choose \\theta_2} = \\mathbf{S}{x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} </math>,\n\nand this relates the parameters of the two rays as:\n\n:<math> \\begin{matrix} x_2 & = & x_1 + d\\theta_1 \\\\\n\\theta_2 & = & \\theta_1 \\end{matrix} </math>\n\n* Another simple example is that of a [[thin lens]]. Its RTM is given by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>,\n\nwhere ''f'' is the [[focal length]] of the lens. To describe combinations of optical components, ray transfer matrices may be multiplied together to obtain an overall RTM for the compound optical system. For the example of free space of length ''d'' followed by a lens of focal length ''f'':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1-\\frac{d}{f} \\end{pmatrix} </math>.\n\nNote that, since the multiplication of matrices is non-[[commutative]], this is not the same RTM as that for a lens followed by free space:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{SL} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\frac{d}{f} & d \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>.\n\nThus the matrices must be ordered appropriately, with the last matrix premultiplying the second last, and so on until the first matrix is premultiplied by the second. Other matrices can be constructed to represent interfaces with media of different [[refractive index|refractive indices]], reflection from [[mirror]]s, etc.\n\n== Table of ray transfer matrices ==\n'''for simple optical components'''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n|- style=\"background-color: #AAFFCC\"\n!

At its simplest, an optical resonator consists of two identical facing mirrors of 100% [[reflectivity]] and radius of [[curvature]] ''R'', separated by some distance ''d''. For the purposes of ray tracing, this is equivalent to a series of identical thin lenses of focal length ''f''=''R''/2, each separated from the next by length ''d''. This construction is known as a ''lens equivalent duct'' or ''lens equivalent [[waveguide]]''. The RTM of each section of the waveguide is, as above,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{M} =\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ \\frac{-1}{f} & 1-\\frac{d}{f} \\end{pmatrix} </math>.\n\nRTM analysis can now be used to determine the ''stability'' of the waveguide (and equivalently, the resonator). That is, it can be determined under what conditions light travelling down the waveguide will be periodically refocussed and stay within the waveguide. To do so, we can find all the \"eigenrays\" of the system: the input ray vector at each of the mentioned sections of the waveguide times a real or complex factor \u03bb is equal to the output one. This gives:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{M}{x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} = {x_2 \\choose \\theta_2} = \\lambda {x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} </math>.\n\nwhich is an [[eigenvalue]] equation:\n\n:<math> \\left[ \\mathbf{M} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I} \\right] {x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} = 0 </math>,\n\nwhere '''I''' is the 2x2 [[identity matrix]].\n\nWe proceed to calculate the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{det}  \\left[  \\mathbf{M} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I} \\right] = 0  </math>,\n\nleading to the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]]\n\n:<math> \\lambda^2 - \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{M}) \\lambda + \\operatorname{det}( \\mathbf{M}) = 0 </math>,\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>  \\operatorname{tr} ( \\mathbf{M} )   =    A + D   =   2 - { d \\over f }  </math>\n\nis the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the RTM, and\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{det}(\\mathbf{M}) = AD - BC  = 1 </math>\n\nis the [[determinant]] of the RTM.  After one common substitution we have:\n\n:<math> \\lambda^2 - 2g \\lambda + 1 = 0  </math>,\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> g \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   { \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{M}) \\over 2 } = 1 - { d \\over 2 f } </math>\n\nis the ''stability parameter''. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation. From the [[Quadratic equation#Quadratic formula and its derivation|quadratic formula]] we find\n\n:<math> \\lambda_{\\pm}  =  g \\pm \\sqrt{g^2 - 1} \\, </math>\n\nNow, consider a ray after ''N'' passes through the system:\n\n:<math> {x_N \\choose \\theta_N} = \\lambda^N {x_1 \\choose \\theta_1} </math>.\n\nIf the waveguide is stable, no ray should stray arbitrarily far from the main axis, that is, \u03bb<sup>N</sup> must not grow without limit. Suppose <math> g^2 > 1</math>. Then both eigenvalues are real. Since <math> \\lambda_+ \\lambda_- = 1</math>, one of them has to be bigger than 1 (in absolute value), which implies that the ray which corresponds to this eigenvector would not converge. Therefore, in a stable waveguide, <math> g^2 </math> \u2264 1,  and the eigenvalues can be represented by complex numbers:\n\n:<math> \\lambda_{\\pm} = g \\pm i \\sqrt{1 - g^2} = \\cos(\\phi) \\pm i \\sin(\\phi) =  e^{\\pm i \\phi} </math>,\n\nwith the substitution g = cos(\u03d5).\n\nFor <math> g^2 < 1 </math> let <math> r_+ </math> and <math> r_- </math> be the eigenvectors with respect to the eigenvalues <math> \\lambda_+ </math> and <math> \\lambda_- </math> respectively, which span all the vector space because they are orthogonal, the latter due to <math>\\lambda_+</math> \u2260 <math>\\lambda_- </math>. The input vector can therefore be written as\n\n:<math> c_+ r_+ + c_- r_-  </math>,\n\nfor some constants <math> c_+ </math> and <math> c_- </math>.\n\nAfter ''N'' waveguide sectors, the output reads\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{M}^N (c_+ r_+ + c_- r_-) = \\lambda_+^N c_+ r_+ + \\lambda_-^N c_- r_- = e^{i N \\phi} c_+ r_+ + e^{- i N \\phi} c_- r_- </math>,\n\nwhich represents a periodic function.\n\n== Ray transfer matrices for Gaussian beams ==\nThe same matrices can also be used to calculate the evolution of [[Gaussian beam]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian vaziri|first1=M R|title=New ducting model for analyzing the Gaussian beam propagation in nonlinear Kerr media and its application to spatial self-phase modulations|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=035202|doi=10.1088/2040-8978/15/3/035202|bibcode=2013JOpt...15c5202R|year=2013}}</ref> propagating through optical components described by the same transmission matrices.
