Brown]], and follows a grieving woman who sets out for revenge after discovering the plane crash that killed her family was a terrorist attack.\n\n''The Rhythm Section'' was released in the United States on January 31, 2020, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], having the worst wide opening weekend of all-time, the biggest drop in theaters, and is projected to lose the studio as much as $40 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nThree years after her family's death in a plane crash, Stephanie Patrick works as a prostitute in London and is addicted to drugs. One day, she is approached at her brothel by a journalist, Keith Proctor, who tells her that the plane crash was not an accident, but was a terrorist attack covered up by the government. \n\nThough she initially does not believe him, Stephanie visits his apartment, where she sees all of his research on the crash. He tells her that the plane crash was caused by a bomb made by a man named Reza, who attends university in London. Stephanie buys a gun and tracks Reza to the university cafeteria. She plans to kill him, but at the last second, she is unable to pull the trigger and Reza escapes. Hours later, Stephanie returns to Proctor's apartment, where she had been staying, and finds Proctor dead.\n\nThrough Proctor's notes, she discovers that his source for his research, B (an ex-MI6 agent), lives in a remote location in Scotland. She travels to Scotland to find B, who is disgusted with her quest to find and kill Reza. After she explains that she has nothing to lose, he reluctantly trains her to complete her quest. B, Iain Boyd, explains to her that Reza was hired by a radical terrorist, U-17, who downed the plane to kill liberal Muslim reformer Abdul Kaif. The rest of the plane crash was collateral damage. Stephanie is trained to assume the identity of an assassin, Petra Reuter, whom Boyd killed, but whose body was never found. \n\nAfter months of extensive training, Boyd instructs her to go to [[Madrid]] to find Marc Serra, an information broker and ex-CIA agent. Stephanie visits Kaif's father Suleman and asks him to fund her mission, as he had been funding Proctor's research. Suleman refuses, accusing Proctor of taking his money and vanishing, and tells Stephanie to leave. Kaif's mother Alia overhears and offers to fund Stephanie. Stephanie accepts and leaves her father's wedding ring with Alia, promising to return for it.\n\nStephanie arrives in Madrid and makes contact with Serra, posing as Petra Reuter. Serra is skeptical but tells her that he needs someone killed, a notorious gangster named Lehmans who lives in [[Tangier]] and who arranged for the bomb to be on the flight. Boyd tells her to take the job, to prove herself as Petra Reuter. She travels to Tangier and finds Lehmans, who requires an oxygen mask to breathe. After a prolonged fight, Lehmans dies when separated for his breathing mask for too long. Stephanie is discovered by Lehmans' men, but escapes after a car chase.\n\nSerra next tells Stephanie to kill businessman Leon Giler in New York. Boyd once again tells her to take the job, as Giler financed the bombing and U-17. Boyd goes with her to New York and provides her with a knockout gas inhaler, and a knife to slit his throat. Stephanie poses as a prostitute and seduces Giler, but is unable to kill him and leaves. As Giler leaves the hotel and gets into his car, Boyd detonates a remote bomb, killing Giler, along with his chauffeur and two young children.\n\nBack at their New York hotel, Stephanie is horrified by the death of Giler's children. Though Boyd had only planned to kill Giler, he is unapologetic. He also reveals that he was released from MI6 after killing Petra, who killed his wife. The CIA disapproved of killing Petra, as she had intel on U-17; thus Boyd also feels responsible for the plane bomb. With this new information, Stephanie leaves Boyd, and returns to Madrid to be with Serra, with whom she begins a relationship. \n\nBoyd warns her that U-17 hired Serra to find someone to eliminate Giler and is eliminating all ties to him, which leads Serra to suggest that Reza is U-17. Serra provides Stephanie information that Reza is in [[Marseilles]]. She discovers him with a female associate wearing a suicide vest, preparing for another bombing. Stephanie attempts to kill them, but they escape after a firefight. Following them onto a bus, she attacks Reza. Reza's associate attempts to trigger the bomb, but it does not detonate. The bus passengers evacuate while Stephanie fights and subdues Reza. Reza's associate realises the bomb is on a timer, and that Reza had not intended to sacrifice himself. She accuses him of being a coward and tells Stephanie to leave the bus before the bomb is detonated, killing Reza and the bomber.\n\nStephanie returns to Serra's house and reveals that she is not Petra Reuter. She kills him with a deadly venom, revealing that she has discovered that Serra is U-17, as Reza was too inconsequential to be the mastermind behind the bombing. Her revenge complete, she leaves his house and visits Kaif's mother Alia, telling her that the people behind her son's death have been killed. Alia thanks her and returns Stephanie's father's ring.\n\nSome time later, Boyd attacks Stephanie in the street, pinning her against a wall. She asks if he is working for MI6 again, and he tells her that he will be allowed back if he kills \"Petra\". He releases her and tells her to disappear. As Stephanie walks away, a smile crosses her face.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Blake Lively]] as Stephanie Patrick\n* [[Jude Law]] as Iain Boyd\n* [[Sterling K.

Brown]], and follows a grieving woman who sets out for revenge after discovering the plane crash that killed her family was a terrorist attack.\n\n''The Rhythm Section'' was released in the United States on January 31, 2020, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], having the worst wide opening weekend of all-time, the biggest drop in theaters, and is projected to lose the studio as much as $40 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nThree years after her family's death in a plane crash, Stephanie Patrick works as a prostitute in London and is addicted to drugs. One day, she is approached at her brothel by a journalist, Keith Proctor, who tells her that the plane crash was not an accident, but was a terrorist attack covered up by the government. \n\nThough she initially does not believe him, Stephanie visits his apartment, where she sees all of his research on the crash. He tells her that the plane crash was caused by a bomb made by a man named Reza, who attends university in London. Stephanie buys a gun and tracks Reza to the university cafeteria. She plans to kill him, but at the last second, she is unable to pull the trigger and Reza escapes. Hours later, Stephanie returns to Proctor's apartment, where she had been staying, and finds Proctor dead.\n\nThrough Proctor's notes, she discovers that his source for his research, B (an ex-MI6 agent), lives in a remote location in Scotland. She travels to Scotland to find B, who is disgusted with her quest to find and kill Reza. After she explains that she has nothing to lose, he reluctantly trains her to complete her quest. B, Iain Boyd, explains to her that Reza was hired by a radical terrorist, U-17, who downed the plane to kill liberal Muslim reformer Abdul Kaif. The rest of the plane crash was collateral damage. Stephanie is trained to assume the identity of an assassin, Petra Reuter, whom Boyd killed, but whose body was never found. \n\nAfter months of extensive training, Boyd instructs her to go to [[Madrid]] to find Marc Serra, an information broker and ex-CIA agent. Stephanie visits Kaif's father Suleman and asks him to fund her mission, as he had been funding Proctor's research. Suleman refuses, accusing Proctor of taking his money and vanishing, and tells Stephanie to leave. Kaif's mother Alia overhears and offers to fund Stephanie. Stephanie accepts and leaves her father's wedding ring with Alia, promising to return for it.\n\nStephanie arrives in Madrid and makes contact with Serra, posing as Petra Reuter. Serra is skeptical but tells her that he needs Lehmans killed, a notorious gangster in [[Tangier]], who arranged for the bomb to be on the flight. Boyd tells her to take the job, to prove herself as Petra Reuter. She travels to Tangier and finds Lehmans, who requires an oxygen mask to breathe. After a prolonged fight, Lehmans dies when separated for his breathing mask for too long. Stephanie is discovered by Lehmans' men, but escapes after a car chase.\n\nSerra next tells Stephanie to kill businessman Leon Giler in New York. Boyd once again tells her to take the job, as Giler financed the bombing and U-17. Boyd goes with her to New York and provides her with a knockout gas inhaler, and a knife to slit his throat. Stephanie poses as a prostitute and seduces Giler, but is unable to kill him and leaves. As Giler leaves the hotel and gets into his car, Boyd detonates a remote bomb, killing Giler, along with his chauffeur and two young children.\n\nBack at their New York hotel, Stephanie is horrified by the death of Giler's children. Though Boyd had only planned to kill Giler, he is unapologetic. He also reveals that he was released from MI6 after killing Petra, who killed his wife. The CIA disapproved of killing Petra, as she had intel on U-17; thus Boyd also feels responsible for the plane bomb. With this new information, Stephanie leaves Boyd, and returns to Madrid to be with Serra, with whom she begins a relationship. \n\nBoyd warns her that U-17 hired Serra to find someone to eliminate Giler and is eliminating all ties to him, which leads Serra to suggest that Reza is U-17. Serra provides Stephanie information that Reza is in [[Marseilles]]. She discovers him with a female associate wearing a suicide vest, preparing for another bombing. Stephanie attempts to kill them, but they escape after a firefight. Following them onto a bus, she attacks Reza. Reza's associate attempts to trigger the bomb, but it does not detonate. The bus passengers evacuate while Stephanie fights and subdues Reza. Reza's associate realises the bomb is on a timer, and that Reza had not intended to sacrifice himself. She accuses him of being a coward and tells Stephanie to leave the bus before the bomb is detonated, killing Reza and the bomber.\n\nStephanie returns to Serra's house and reveals that she is not Petra Reuter. She kills him with a deadly venom, revealing that she has discovered that Serra is U-17, as Reza was too inconsequential to be the mastermind behind the bombing. Her revenge complete, she leaves his house and visits Kaif's mother Alia, telling her that the people behind her son's death have been killed. Alia thanks her and returns Stephanie's father's ring.\n\nSome time later, Boyd attacks Stephanie in the street, pinning her against a wall. She asks if he is working for MI6 again, and he tells her that he will be allowed back if he kills \"Petra\". He releases her and tells her to disappear. As Stephanie walks away, a smile crosses her face.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Blake Lively]] as Stephanie Patrick\n* [[Jude Law]] as Iain Boyd\n* [[Sterling K.

It originally ran as the miniseries \"Killer\" from 6 until 20 September 1983, before a full series was commissioned that ran from 2 July 1985 until 7 November 2010. The series revolved around a group of detectives initially in the [[Maryhill]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] of [[Strathclyde Police]], though various storylines were set in other parts of [[Greater Glasgow]] and in other areas of [[Scotland]]. The team operated out of the fictional John Street police station. [[Mark McManus]], who played the title character [[Jim Taggart]], died in 1994; however the series continued under the same name.\n\n''Taggart'' was one of the UKs longest-running television dramas and the longest-running police drama after the cancellation of ''[[The Bill]]''.\n\nThe series theme music is \"[[No Mean City]]\" sung by [[Maggie Bell]].\n\n==History==\nThe Scottish BAFTA-winning [[pilot episode]] \"Killer\", directed by [[Laurence Moody]] and broadcast in 1983, introduced the character [[Detective Chief Inspector]] [[Jim Taggart]] (played by [[Mark McManus]] until his death in 1994), a tough and experienced detective who had worked his way up through the ranks. His original sidekick was [[Detective Sergeant]] Peter Livingstone ([[Neil Duncan]]). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray ([[Tom Watson (actor)|Tom Watson]]). This humour was continued in the subsequent series when Taggart's boss after the second episode, \"Dead Ringer\", being Superintendent Jack McVitie ([[Iain Anders]]). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house.This sub-plot ran through 1990\u201391 until the Hettie character was finally killed off in the 1991 season finale, \"Violent Delights\".\n\nIn 1987 the character of Michael Jardine ([[James MacPherson (actor)|James MacPherson]]) was introduced. [[Neil Duncan]] left the series in 1987 and in 1990 a new female sidekick [[Jackie Reid]] ([[Blythe Duff]]) was introduced.\n\nMcManus died in 1994 during the filming of an episode. Taggart's absence in the broadcast story was explained by his being in meetings with the [[Chief Constable]] throughout. In 1995 the episode \"Black Orchid\" opened with Taggart's funeral. Despite the death of the title character the series went unchanged. Jardine was promoted to Detective Inspector and DC Stuart Fraser ([[Colin McCredie]]) was introduced, becoming the long-suffering sidekick to Jardine, former long-suffering sidekick to Taggart. Fraser was later revealed to be gay. McCredie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' when he played a suspect part of a youth gang. DI Robbie Ross ([[John Michie]]) joined the team in 1998. Michie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' in 1990 when he played a suspect called Robby Meiklejohn in an episode called \"Love Knot\".\n\nWhen MacPherson left the series in 2002 his character was killed off and replaced with DCI Matt Burke, formerly of [[Special Branch]], played by [[Alex Norton]], who had previously appeared in the series playing murder suspect George Bryce in 1986 in the episode \"Knife Edge\".\n\nMuch was made of the platonic love between Jardine and Reid. The two were shown to share a brother/sister-like bond. Both pursued a number of relationships with other characters over the years. Reid even got married but later separated from her husband, who then died. The personal relationships of the police officers in this series were shown as nothing to be envious of: Reid once described herself, Burke, Ross and Fraser as three divorcees and a celibate homosexual in the episode \"Penthouse and Pavement\".\n\nAfter filming was completed on series 26 in December 2009, [[Colin McCredie]] was informed that he and his character would not be returning for filming of the next series.\n\n===ITV/STV dispute===\n[[ITV plc]] the company that operates the [[ITV]] network franchises in England Wales and southern Scotland failed to announce whether it planned to show any new episodes of Taggart prompting [[STV]] to suspend production of the programme in September 2009. [[STV]] announced in November 2009 that it would produce new episodes of Taggart for broadcast in 2010 regardless of whether [[ITV plc]] decided to screen it.\n\nIn February 2010 it was announced that [[ITV]] and [[STV]] had put their wider commercial differences to one side to make a new series, which Scottish viewers got to see first. The two broadcasters co-commissioned a six-part series of the show [[UKTV]] also invested in return for repeat rights. New episodes of Taggart debuted on [[STV]] in autumn 2010 before being broadcast on [[ITV]] across the rest of the UK in 2011. The [[UKTV]] Channel [[Alibi]] showed the episodes in 2013. Online catch-up of the new series was not available to users of [[STV Player]] until the show had been broadcast on [[ITV]] and [[UTV]].\n\n==Format and broadcast information==\nThe format of the show changed over the years. Originally the show ran with three one-hour episodes to each story. This was later changed starting with the last transmitted story in 1998 to a regular pattern of two-hour stand-alone stories and beginning in July 2002 these were shortened to 60 minutes. After a two-hour special episode in January 2003 episodes were again lengthened starting in October this time to 90 minutes continuing through the 2008 New Year special \"Genesis\". After this the show became a series of one-hour stand-alone stories for the first time since 2003.\n\nFans of the show were often frustrated by the erratic scheduling of the show. Although blocks or series of the show were filmed together they were often not shown together as with other series. Instead they were fitted into the schedule whenever there was a gap, meaning that they were often not shown in consecutive weeks or on one set night of the week. Often months passed between episodes of the same series being shown. This was very much the case in Australia with [[ABC TV]] showing episodes featuring the three lead actors in haphazard order with current or recent shows.This made it very difficult to understand the history of the show.\n\n===DVD releases===\nThe DVD rights in the UK for many ''Taggart'' episodes the earlier series in particular are held by Clearvision. However some episodes in particular those from 2002 onwards have been released on DVD in the UK by [[Acorn Media UK]]. There are also Region 1 and Region 4 releases for [[Northern America]] and [[Australasia]] markets. Some of the DVD releases are now quite rare and deleted and there has been no [[Blu-ray]] release at present.\n\n==Cast of final series==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Blythe Duff]] as WPC/DC/DS/DI [[Jackie Reid]] (1984\u20132010)<ref group=\"n\" name=\"Duff\">Duff played an Uncredited Police Woman from 1984 until 1990 when she was named as Jackie Reid</ref>\n* [[John Michie]] as DI Robert \"Robbie\" Ross (1998\u20132010)\n* [[Alex Norton]] as DCI Matt Burke (2002\u20132010)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Siobhan Redmond]] as Chief Supt.

In later years a shot of the city centre taken from The Lighthouse on Mitchell Lane was used.\n\nIn later series the buildings of [[Strathclyde University]] were extensively used for exterior shots. The entrance level of the Colville Building was used as the police station, for example, and John Street, the name given to the police station in the series, is a real location within the campus.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Taggart episodes}}\nSince 1983 there have been a total of 110 episodes of ''Taggart''. Early episodes were split into multiple parts and aired over three weeks while later episodes were self-contained.\n\n==International distribution==\nIn [[Australia]] the series airs on [[ABC1]].In 2011 [[ABC1]] aired episodes on Friday at 8:30pm. [[ABC1]] actually broadcast episodes 101 IOU 102 Local Hero and 103 The Rapture\" before [[STV]] did because of scheduling conflicts. [[7TWO]] airs repeat episodes right back to the first episode.\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] the series airs on [[Vibe]].\n\nIn [[Ireland]] the series airs on [[RTE]].\n \n===Denmark===\n[[Taggart]] was a popular show on Danish broadcaster [[DR]].[[Taggart]] was first on [[DR2]] from 2002 to 2006 as six more episodes were then aired. After the digitizing of Danish television [[Taggart]] appeared on [[DR1]] from episodes featuring [[James MacPherson]] as DCI Jardine. Ever since [[Taggart]] has aired from the very first miniseries Killer until the episode length was cut to 45 minutes. Three-episode stories have aired one after another but has also combined into one long episode.

It originally ran as the miniseries \"Killer\" from 6 until 20 September 1983, before a full series was commissioned that ran from 2 July 1985 until 7 November 2010. The series revolved around a group of detectives initially in the [[Maryhill]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] of [[Strathclyde Police]], though various storylines were set in other parts of [[Greater Glasgow]] and in other areas of [[Scotland]]. The team operated out of the fictional John Street police station. [[Mark McManus]], who played the title character [[Jim Taggart]], died in 1994; however the series continued under the same name.\n\n''Taggart'' was one of the UKs longest-running television dramas and the longest-running police drama after the cancellation of ''[[The Bill]]''.\n\nThe series theme music is \"[[No Mean City]]\" sung by [[Maggie Bell]].\n\n==History==\nThe Scottish BAFTA-winning [[pilot episode]] \"Killer\", directed by [[Laurence Moody]] and broadcast in 1983, introduced the character [[Detective Chief Inspector]] [[Jim Taggart]] (played by [[Mark McManus]] until his death in 1994), a tough and experienced detective who had worked his way up through the ranks. His original sidekick was [[Detective Sergeant]] Peter Livingstone ([[Neil Duncan]]). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray ([[Tom Watson (actor)|Tom Watson]]). This humour was continued in the subsequent series when Taggart's boss after the second episode, \"Dead Ringer\", being Superintendent Jack McVitie ([[Iain Anders]]). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house.This sub-plot ran through 1990-91 until the Hettie character was finally killed off in the 1991 season finale, \"Violent Delights\".\n\nIn 1987 the character of Michael Jardine ([[James MacPherson (actor)|James MacPherson]]) was introduced. [[Neil Duncan]] left the series in 1987 and in 1990 a new female sidekick [[Jackie Reid]] ([[Blythe Duff]]) was introduced.\n\nMcManus died in 1994 during the filming of an episode. Taggart's absence in the broadcast story was explained by his being in meetings with the [[Chief Constable]] throughout. In 1995 the episode \"Black Orchid\" opened with Taggart's funeral. Despite the death of the title character the series went unchanged. Jardine was promoted to Detective Inspector and DC Stuart Fraser ([[Colin McCredie]]) was introduced, becoming the long-suffering sidekick to Jardine, former long-suffering sidekick to Taggart. Fraser was later revealed to be gay. McCredie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' when he played a suspect part of a youth gang. DI Robbie Ross ([[John Michie]]) joined the team in 1998. Michie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' in 1990 when he played a suspect called Robby Meiklejohn in an episode called \"Love Knot\".\n\nWhen MacPherson left the series in 2002 his character was killed off and replaced with DCI Matt Burke, formerly of [[Special Branch]], played by [[Alex Norton]], who had previously appeared in the series playing murder suspect George Bryce in 1986 in the episode \"Knife Edge\".\n\nMuch was made of the platonic love between Jardine and Reid. The two were shown to share a brother/sister-like bond. Both pursued a number of relationships with other characters over the years. Reid even got married but later separated from her husband, who then died. The personal relationships of the police officers in this series were shown as nothing to be envious of: Reid once described herself, Burke, Ross and Fraser as three divorcees and a celibate homosexual in the episode \"Penthouse and Pavement\".\n\nAfter filming was completed on series 26 in December 2009, [[Colin McCredie]] was informed that he and his character would not be returning for filming of the next series.\n\n===ITV/STV dispute===\n[[ITV plc]] the company that operates the [[ITV]] network franchises in England Wales and southern Scotland failed to announce whether it planned to show any new episodes of Taggart prompting [[STV]] to suspend production of the programme in September 2009. [[STV]] announced in November 2009 that it would produce new episodes of Taggart for broadcast in 2010 regardless of whether [[ITV plc]] decided to screen it.\n\nIn February 2010 it was announced that [[ITV]] and [[STV]] had put their wider commercial differences to one side to make a new series, which Scottish viewers got to see first. The two broadcasters co-commissioned a six-part series of the show [[UKTV]] also invested in return for repeat rights. New episodes of Taggart debuted on [[STV]] in autumn 2010 before being broadcast on [[ITV]] across the rest of the UK in 2011. The [[UKTV]] Channel [[Alibi]] showed the episodes in 2013. Online catch-up of the new series was not available to users of [[STV Player]] until the show had been broadcast on [[ITV]] and [[UTV]].\n\n==Format and broadcast information==\nThe format of the show changed over the years. Originally the show ran with three one-hour episodes to each story. This was later changed starting with the last transmitted story in 1998 to a regular pattern of two-hour stand-alone stories and beginning in July 2002 these were shortened to 60 minutes. After a two-hour special episode in January 2003 episodes were again lengthened starting in October this time to 90 minutes continuing through the 2008 New Year special \"Genesis\". After this the show became a series of one-hour stand-alone stories for the first time since 2003.\n\nFans of the show were often frustrated by the erratic scheduling of the show. Although blocks or series of the show were filmed together they were often not shown together as with other series. Instead they were fitted into the schedule whenever there was a gap, meaning that they were often not shown in consecutive weeks or on one set night of the week. Often months passed between episodes of the same series being shown. This was very much the case in Australia with [[ABC TV]] showing episodes featuring the three lead actors in haphazard order with current or recent shows.This made it very difficult to understand the history of the show.\n\n===DVD releases===\nThe DVD rights in the UK for many ''Taggart'' episodes the earlier series in particular are held by Clearvision. However some episodes in particular those from 2002 onwards have been released on DVD in the UK by [[Acorn Media UK]]. There are also Region 1 and Region 4 releases for [[Northern America]] and [[Australasia]] markets. Some of the DVD releases are now quite rare and deleted and there has been no [[Blu-ray]] release at present.\n\n==Cast of final series==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Blythe Duff]] as WPC/DC/DS/DI [[Jackie Reid]] (1984\u20132010)<ref group=\"n\" name=\"Duff\">Duff played an Uncredited Police Woman from 1984 until 1990 when she was named as Jackie Reid</ref>\n* [[John Michie]] as DI Robert \"Robbie\" Ross (1998\u20132010)\n* [[Alex Norton]] as DCI Matt Burke (2002\u20132010)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Siobhan Redmond]] as Chief Supt.

In later years a shot of the city centre taken from The Lighthouse on Mitchell Lane was used.\n\nIn later series the buildings of [[Strathclyde University]] were extensively used for exterior shots. The entrance level of the Colville Building was used as the police station, for example, and John Street, the name given to the police station in the series, is a real location within the campus.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Taggart episodes}}\nSince 1983 there have been a total of 110 episodes of ''Taggart''. Early episodes were split into multiple parts and aired over three weeks while later episodes were self-contained.\n\n==International distribution==\nIn [[Australia]] the series airs on [[ABC1]].In 2011 [[ABC1]] aired episodes on Friday at 8:30pm. [[ABC1]] actually broadcast episodes 101 IOU 102 Local Hero and 103 The Rapture\" before [[STV]] did because of scheduling conflicts. [[7TWO]] airs repeat episodes right back to the first episode.\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] the series airs on [[Vibe]].\n\nIn [[Ireland]] the series airs on [[RTE]].\n \n===Denmark===\n[[Taggart]] was a popular show on Danish broadcaster [[DR]].[[Taggart]] was first on [[DR2]] from 2002 to 2006 as six more episodes were then aired. After the digitizing of Danish television [[Taggart]] appeared on [[DR1]] from episodes featuring [[James MacPherson]] as DCI Jardine. Ever since [[Taggart]] has aired from the very first miniseries Killer until the episode length was cut to 45 minutes. Three-episode stories have aired one after another but has also combined into one long episode. No other British detective programme has aired as much as [[Taggart]] explained by the large number of available episodes.From a Danish television perspective [[Taggart]] is unique as it  became popular after it aired in the UK. After the death of [[Mark McManus]] and the departure of [[James MacPherson]]. [[DR]] states [[Taggart]] is the most resilient British criminal series ever.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{stv.tv|id=taggart|title=''Taggart''}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0088621|title=Taggart}}\n* {{tv.com show|taggart|Taggart}}\n\n{{Taggart}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n[[Category:1985 Scottish television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010 Scottish television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British crime drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British mystery television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British workplace drama television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British crime drama television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British mystery television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British workplace drama television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British crime drama television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British mystery television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British workplace drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British crime drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British mystery television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British workplace drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s Scottish television series]]\n[[Category:1990s Scottish television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Scottish television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Scottish television series]]\n[[Category:British detective television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ITV crime programmes]]\n[[Category:ITV mystery programmes]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Maryhill]]\n[[Category:Murder in television]]\n[[Category:STV Productions]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Scottish Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Glasgow]]\n", "name_user": "Jerome Kohl", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taggart"}

The community of [[Callander, Ontario|Callander]], on the South-East Bay of [[Lake Nipissing]], had been named Callander in 1880, to honour the birthplace in [[Scotland]] of [[Duncan McIntyre (businessman)|Duncan McIntyre]], then president of the Canada Central Railway (CCR).

The community of [[Callander, Ontario|Callander]], on the South-East Bay of [[Lake Nipissing]], had been named Callander in 1880, to honour the birthplace in [[Scotland]] of [[Duncan McIntyre (businessman)|Duncan McIntyre]], then president of the Canada Central Railway (CCR). It was at this place on the shore of Lake Nipissing, that the CCR intended to connect with the proposed eastern terminus of the CPR. In 1881 the Canada Central Railway was merged into the Canadian Pacific, as McIntyre became its vice president.

In [[Maharashtra]], they are found mainly in the district of [[Thane]].Their language is the [[Dhodia language]]. It is a language which is a mixture of unique words, as well as some words influenced by Gujarati as well as Marathi. [[Dhodia language|Their language]] does not have a written tradition.<ref>http://dhodia.info/language.aspx</ref><ref>People of India Maharshtra Volume XXX  Part One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 529-535</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere are many beliefs about the origin of the term \"dhodia\" [http://dhodia.info/history.aspx]. One is that they came from a place called Dhulia. The other belief is that the Rajputs from around the [[Dholka Taluka]], married local women in the tribal villages and later their descendants established themselves as Dhodia. However, these are all just folklore that have yet to be supported by scientific or historic data. The [[Naikda]], another tribal community, claims common descent with the Dhodia.\n\n[[File:Kuldev Pooja.jpg|thumb]]\n\n==Religion and customs==\nMost of the dhodia believe in traditional religious practices [http://dhodia.info/Religions.aspx]. Dhodia primarily have adapted Hinduism. Some however follow [[Christianity]]. Some are following their Adiwashi traditions, worshiping nature.  \n\n[[File:Bhavni Mata.jpg|thumb|Bhavni Mata]]\n\nDhodia Females traditionally wear 'Kachhedo' or it called 'Dhadku' type of saree which mostly gives resembles of Marathi saree. \n[[File:Dhodia Girl.jpg|thumb|Dhadku/ Kachhedo]]\n[[File:Dhodia girl.jpg|thumb|Dhodia Female wearing Kachhedo / Dhadku and holding Baaj [ disposable dish made of palash tree leaves]]]\n\n==Festivals==\nThey celebrate all the festivals that other Hindus do. Diwali, Holi are some examples. The majority of Dhodia believe in and are devoted to \"Kanasari\" or \"Kanseri\" (Goddess of food). They celebrate the \"Kanseri\" festival annually at harvest.

The location of the [[History of Australia|first European settlement and colony]] on the Australian mainland, Port Jackson has continued to play a key role in the history and development of Sydney.\n\nPort Jackson, in the early days of the colony, was also used as a shorthand for Sydney and its environs.

The Cammeraygal lived on the northern side of the harbour. The area along the southern banks of the [[Parramatta River]] to [[Rose Hill, New South Wales|Rose Hill]] belonged to the Wangal.

It is 19&nbsp;km long with an area of 55&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The estuary's volume at high tide is 562&nbsp;million cubic metres. The perimeter of the estuary is 317 kilometres.\n\nAccording to the [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]], Port Jackson is \"a harbour which comprises all the waters within an imaginary line joining North Head and South Head. Within this harbour lies North Harbour, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour.\"<ref>{{NSW GNR|id = ujjtvqWAMa|title = Port Jackson|accessdate = 3 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nPort Jackson extends westward from the single entrance known as [[Sydney Heads]] (North and South Heads) and encompasses all tidal waters within North Harbour, [[Middle Harbour]], Sydney Harbour, [[Darling Harbour]], [[Parramatta River]] and [[Lane Cove River]].<ref>RAN Hydrographic Services Map of Port Jackson published in August 1972.</ref>\n\nThe harbour is heavily embayed.

Today it is little more than a storm water drain but originally it was the fresh water supply for the fledgling colony of New South Wales in the late 18th century. It originated from a swamp to the west of present-day [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and at high tide entered Sydney Cove at the intersection of [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge]] and [[Pitt Street]]s.\n* [[Middle Harbour]] is the northern arm of Port Jackson. It begins as a small creek (Middle Harbour Creek) at St Ives.<ref>UBD Citylink Street Directory Page 155 Map reference F4</ref> It joins the main waterway of Port Jackson between the two headlands, Middle Head and Grotto Point Reserve, adjacent to the Sydney Heads.\n* [[Parramatta River]] is the western arm of Port Jackson.

Its catchment area is approximately 95.4 square kilometres (36.8 sq mi).\n* [[Tarban Creek]], a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, enters Port Jackson at Hunters Hill.\n* [[Johnstons Creek (New South Wales)|Johnstons Creek]] is located in the inner-western suburbs of Glebe, Annandale, Forest Lodge and Stanmore. It rises in Stanmore and flows in a generally northward direction towards Rozelle Bay. The creek passes beneath the stands of the now demolished [[Harold Park Paceway]] prior to emptying into Rozelle Bay at Bicentennial Park Glebe. [[Orphan School Creek]] is a tributary of Johnstons Creek.\n* [[Duck River (New South Wales)|Duck River]] is a perennial stream and southern tributary of the Parramatta River.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Sydney Harbour pano at night.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Sydney Harbour at night, with the [[Sydney Opera House|Opera House]] and [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]]]]\n\n===Bridges===\n[[File:Sydney 02 11 2008.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Anzac Bridge]] is on the righthand side with [[Glebe Island]] and [[White Bay, New South Wales|White Bay]] on the lefthand side.
