Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies.

The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a range of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]].

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

The results of the field experiment did not support the \"[[ecological trap]]\" and \"predator influx\" theories and contribute to a belief that [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] may not be as problematic as previously thought.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Do yellow-faced honeyeater (''Lichenostomus chrysops'') nests experience higher predation at forest edges? |last1=Boulton | first1=R.L. | last2=Clarke | first2=M.F. | journal =Wildlife Research | year= 2003 |volume=30| issue=2| pages=119\u2013125 | doi=10.1071/WR02055}}</ref><!-- cites prev 3 sentences --> In some areas the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens where it damages fruit.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last=Beruldsen |first=Gordon |authorlink=Gordon Beruldsen |year=1980 |title=A Field Guide to Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds |location=Adelaide, S.A. |publisher=Rigby |isbn=978-0-7270-1202-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Higgins |first=Peter |first2=J.

Frankland has continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life \u2014 the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]].

Frankland has continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life \u2014 the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]].

Tropical cyclones that attain such winds and [[landfall|move over land]] while maintaining those winds are capable of causing severe damage to human lives and infrastructure. From 1949 to 2019, a total of 83 recorded [[Pacific hurricane]]s have peaked at Category&nbsp;3 strength within the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Eastern Pacific|Northeast Pacific tropical cyclone basin]], which is denoted as the part of the [[Pacific Ocean]] north of the [[equator]] and east of the [[International Date Line]]. This does not include storms that also attained Category&nbsp;4 or 5 status on the scale.\n\nThe development of Category&nbsp;3 hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin is influenced by many factors. During the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring months of December to April, [[sea surface temperature]]s in the tropics are usually too low to support [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. Furthermore, from January to April, the [[North Pacific High]] and [[Aleutian Low]] induce strong [[vertical wind shear]] and unfavorable conditions that serve to prevent the development of hurricanes. These effects are reduced or even disappear during hurricane season from May to November, when sea surface temperatures are also high enough to support tropical cyclogenesis; the bulk of recorded Category&nbsp;3 hurricanes developed during June to October. Global weather patterns may also influence hurricane development in the Northeast Pacific. [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o events]] result in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear and higher [[sea surface temperature]]s within the basin, while [[La Ni\u00f1a]] events reduce the number of such hurricanes through the opposite.\n\n==Background==\n{{Saffir-Simpson small}}\n[[File:Map of Pacific Category 3 hurricanes.png|thumb|left|320px|Tracks of all known Category&nbsp;3 Pacific hurricanes from 1949\u20132015 in the Northeast Pacific basin|alt=Tracks of all known Category 3 Pacific hurricanes from 1970\u20132015 in the Northeast Pacific basin.]]\nOn the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, a hurricane reaches Category&nbsp;3 status when it attains [[maximum sustained wind]]s of between {{convert|96|kn|mph km/h m/s|lk=on}} and {{convert|112|kn|mph km/h m/s}}.<ref name=\"SSHWS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|title=The Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale|first1=Timothy|last1=Schott|first2=Christopher W|last2=Landsea|first3=Gene|last3=Hafale|first4=Jeffrey|last4=Lorens|first5=Arthur|last5=Taylor|first6=Harvey|last6=Thurm|first7=Bill|last7=Ward|first8=Mark|last8=Willis|first9=Walt|last9=Zaleski|date=February 1, 2012|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|location=[[Miami, Florida]]|access-date=May 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213223055/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) takes sustained winds to be the average wind speed measured over the period of one minute at the height of {{convert|10|m|ft}} above the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html|title=TCFAQ D4) What does \"maximum sustained wind\" mean?

When these conditions are met, a pre-existing tropical disturbance&nbsp;\u2013 usually a [[tropical wave]]&nbsp;\u2013 can develop into a tropical cyclone, provided the disturbance is far enough from the [[Equator]] to experience a sufficiently strong [[Coriolis force]] which is responsible for the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"cyclogenesis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=TCFAQ A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|first=Christopher W|last=Landsea|year=2014|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=August 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|archive-date=2009-08-27|url-status=live}}</ref> During the winter and spring months of December to April, sea surface temperatures in the tropics are usually too low to support development. Also, the presence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|semi-permanent high-pressure area]] known as the [[North Pacific High]] in the eastern Pacific greatly suppresses formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the North Pacific High results in vertical wind shear that causes environmental conditions to be unconducive to tropical cyclone formation. Another factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the presence of a semi-permanent [[low-pressure area]] called the [[Aleutian Low]] between January and April. Its effects in the central Pacific near the [[160th meridian west]] cause tropical waves that form in the area to drift northward into the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and dissipate or become [[extratropical]]. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves,<ref name=\"longshore\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones|last=Longshore|first=David|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File, Inc]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8160-3398-0|edition=1st|pages=333, 334|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334#v=onepage|access-date=2018-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818214458/https://books.google.com/books?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&source=bl&ots=qFGf1P76-U&sig=RvDUOXniAjo9XgEkcKZRVx0qtEI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjNh9Ta0_bcAhXNXn0KHfmWBesQ6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2018-08-18|url-status=live}}</ref> coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May&nbsp;15.<ref name=\"SeasonDates\"/> During summer and autumn, sea surface temperatures rise further to reach near {{convert|29|C|F|abbr=on}} in July and August, well above the {{convert|26.5|C|F|abbr=on}} threshold for tropical cyclogenesis. This allows for hurricanes developing during that time to strengthen significantly.<ref name=\"longshore\"/>\n\nThe [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] also influences the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin. During years with the existence of an El Ni\u00f1o event, [[sea surface temperature]]s increase in the Northeast Pacific and average vertical wind shear decreases, resulting in an increase in activity; the opposite happens in the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Northern Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic basin]] during El Ni\u00f1o, where increased wind shear creates an unfavorable environment for tropical cyclone formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/hurricanes_3.php|title=Hurricanes: The Greatest Storms on Earth: Feature Articles|first1=Steve|last1=Graham|first2=Holli|last2=Riebeek|date=November 1, 2006|work=[[NASA Earth Observatory|Earth Observatory]]|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=July 24, 2018|location=United States|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506091751/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/hurricanes_3.php|archive-date=2017-05-06|url-status=live}}</ref> Contrary to El Ni\u00f1o, [[La Ni\u00f1a]] increases wind shear and decreases sea surface temperatures over the eastern Pacific, while reducing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures over the Atlantic.<ref name=\"longshore\"/>\n\nWithin the Northeast Pacific, tropical cyclones generally head west out into the open Pacific Ocean, steered by the westward [[trade wind]]s. Closer to the end of the season, however, some storms are steered northwards or northeastwards around the [[subtropical ridge]] nearer the end of the season, and may bring impacts to the western coasts of [[Mexico]] and occasionally even [[Central America]]. In the central Pacific basin, the North Pacific High keeps tropical cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands by forcing them southwards.<ref name=\"longshore\"/> Combined with cooler waters around the Hawaiian Islands that tend to weaken approaching tropical cyclones, this makes direct impacts on the Hawaiian Islands by tropical cyclones rare.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-08-03-hawaii-hurricane-tropical-typical-track-history|title=Hawaii Hurricanes: How Unusual Are They?|last=Belles|first=Jonathan|date=August 3, 2018|work=[[The Weather Channel]]|access-date=August 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820203427/https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-08-03-hawaii-hurricane-tropical-typical-track-history|archive-date=2018-08-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Systems==\n;Key:\n*{{Dagger|alt=discontinuous duration}} Discontinuous duration (weakened below Category 3 then restrengthened to that classification at least once)\n*{{Double dagger|alt=intensified further in another basin}} Intensified past Category&nbsp;3 intensity after exiting basin\n*{{legend|#F2CEE0|Storm made landfall, see [[#Landfalls|below]] for further information|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA|text={{hash-tag|alt=made landfall there}}}}\n*{{legend|#FAECC8|Pressure listed was not at peak intensity{{#tag:ref|Prior to 1988 for the Eastern Pacific and 2001 for the Central Pacific, pressure data was only available through direct measurements by reconnaissance aircraft that penetrated the storm or reports from ships and land-based weather stations, or estimates derived from satellite imagery.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Landsea |first1=Chris |last2=Franklin |first2=James |last3=Blake |first3=Eric |last4=Tanabe |first4=Ray |title=The revised Northeast and North Central Pacific hurricane database (HURDAT2) |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-format-nencpac.pdf |publisher=National Hurricane Center |accessdate=9 December 2019 |date=February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"pressure\">{{cite report|accessdate=July 27, 2013 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/NWS-NHC-1982-16.pdf |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service |title=A Compilation of Eastern and Central North Pacific Tropical Cyclone Data |author1=Brown, Gail M|author2=Leftwhich, Preston W Jr|author3=National Hurricane Center |type=NOAA Technical Memorandum NWS NHC 16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IQvglkRh?url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/NWS-NHC-1982-16.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |date=August 1982 |url-status=live }}</ref> Should any reading or estimate be available, the lowest is listed below.|group=\"nb\"}}|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA|text={{section-sign|alt=not at peak intensity}}}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n!

Tropical cyclones that attain such winds and [[landfall|move over land]] while maintaining those winds are capable of causing severe damage to human lives and infrastructure.

This does not include storms that also attained Category&nbsp;4 or 5 status on the scale.\n\nThe development of Category&nbsp;3 hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin is influenced by many factors. During the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring months of December to April, [[sea surface temperature]]s in the tropics are usually too low to support [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. Furthermore, from January to April, the [[North Pacific High]] and [[Aleutian Low]] induce strong [[vertical wind shear]] and unfavorable conditions that serve to prevent the development of hurricanes. These effects are reduced or even disappear during hurricane season from May to November, when sea surface temperatures are also high enough to support tropical cyclogenesis; the bulk of recorded Category&nbsp;3 hurricanes developed during June to October. Global weather patterns may also influence hurricane development in the Northeast Pacific. [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o events]] result in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear and higher [[sea surface temperature]]s within the basin, while [[La Ni\u00f1a]] events reduce the number of such hurricanes through the opposite.\n\n==Background==\n{{Saffir-Simpson small}}\n[[File:Map of Pacific Category 3 hurricanes.png|thumb|left|320px|Tracks of all known Category&nbsp;3 Pacific hurricanes from 1949\u20132015 in the Northeast Pacific basin|alt=Tracks of all known Category 3 Pacific hurricanes from 1970\u20132015 in the Northeast Pacific basin.]]\nOn the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, a hurricane reaches Category&nbsp;3 status when it attains [[maximum sustained wind]]s of between {{convert|96|kn|mph km/h m/s|lk=on}} and {{convert|112|kn|mph km/h m/s}}.<ref name=\"SSHWS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|title=The Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale|first1=Timothy|last1=Schott|first2=Christopher W|last2=Landsea|first3=Gene|last3=Hafale|first4=Jeffrey|last4=Lorens|first5=Arthur|last5=Taylor|first6=Harvey|last6=Thurm|first7=Bill|last7=Ward|first8=Mark|last8=Willis|first9=Walt|last9=Zaleski|date=February 1, 2012|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|location=[[Miami, Florida]]|access-date=May 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213223055/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) takes sustained winds to be the average wind speed measured over the period of one minute at the height of {{convert|10|m|ft}} above the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html|title=TCFAQ D4) What does \"maximum sustained wind\" mean?

When these conditions are met, a pre-existing tropical disturbance&nbsp;\u2013 usually a [[tropical wave]]&nbsp;\u2013 can develop into a tropical cyclone, provided the disturbance is far enough from the [[Equator]] to experience a sufficiently strong [[Coriolis force]] which is responsible for the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"cyclogenesis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=TCFAQ A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|first=Christopher W|last=Landsea|year=2014|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=August 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|archive-date=2009-08-27|url-status=live}}</ref> During the winter and spring months of December to April, sea surface temperatures in the tropics are usually too low to support development. Also, the presence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|semi-permanent high-pressure area]] known as the [[North Pacific High]] in the eastern Pacific greatly suppresses formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the North Pacific High results in vertical wind shear that causes environmental conditions to be unconducive to tropical cyclone formation. Another factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the presence of a semi-permanent [[low-pressure area]] called the [[Aleutian Low]] between January and April. Its effects in the central Pacific near the [[160th meridian west]] cause tropical waves that form in the area to drift northward into the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and dissipate or become [[extratropical]]. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves,<ref name=\"longshore\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones|last=Longshore|first=David|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File, Inc]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8160-3398-0|edition=1st|pages=333, 334|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334#v=onepage|access-date=2018-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818214458/https://books.google.com/books?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&source=bl&ots=qFGf1P76-U&sig=RvDUOXniAjo9XgEkcKZRVx0qtEI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjNh9Ta0_bcAhXNXn0KHfmWBesQ6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2018-08-18|url-status=live}}</ref> coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May&nbsp;15.<ref name=\"SeasonDates\"/> During summer and autumn, sea surface temperatures rise further to reach near {{convert|29|C|F|abbr=on}} in July and August, well above the {{convert|26.5|C|F|abbr=on}} threshold for tropical cyclogenesis. This allows for hurricanes developing during that time to strengthen significantly.<ref name=\"longshore\"/>\n\nThe [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] also influences the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin. During years with the existence of an El Ni\u00f1o event, [[sea surface temperature]]s increase in the Northeast Pacific and average vertical wind shear decreases, resulting in an increase in activity; the opposite happens in the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Northern Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic basin]] during El Ni\u00f1o, where increased wind shear creates an unfavorable environment for tropical cyclone formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/hurricanes_3.php|title=Hurricanes: The Greatest Storms on Earth: Feature Articles|first1=Steve|last1=Graham|first2=Holli|last2=Riebeek|date=November 1, 2006|work=[[NASA Earth Observatory|Earth Observatory]]|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=July 24, 2018|location=United States|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506091751/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/hurricanes_3.php|archive-date=2017-05-06|url-status=live}}</ref> Contrary to El Ni\u00f1o, [[La Ni\u00f1a]] increases wind shear and decreases sea surface temperatures over the eastern Pacific, while reducing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures over the Atlantic.<ref name=\"longshore\"/>\n\nWithin the Northeast Pacific, tropical cyclones generally head west out into the open Pacific Ocean, steered by the westward [[trade wind]]s. Closer to the end of the season, however, some storms are steered northwards or northeastwards around the [[subtropical ridge]] nearer the end of the season, and may bring impacts to the western coasts of [[Mexico]] and occasionally even [[Central America]].

His mother died at birth and he was raised by his grandmother and other relatives. At age 6, he was making a living as a shoe polisher while attending primary school. After graduating from high school in 1978 from the Colegio San Agustin, Julio studied at the [[Universidad Pedag\u00f3gica Experimental Libertador|Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico de Caracas]].\n\nAguilera was inclined towards the arts since he was in primary school, and he began painting at a young age after a local painter gave him a handful of used brushes and half-empty tubes of oil paint.<ref>[http://www.artareas.com/ArtAreas/home.nsf/Profiles/JULIO+AGUILERA Julio Aguilera: A Venezuelan Artist Makes His Mark in North America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410224514/http://artareas.com/ArtAreas/home.nsf/Profiles/JULIO+AGUILERA |date=2007-04-10 }} Ed McCormack. Gallery & Studio, March, 2005</ref> However strong, his artistic inclinations had to take a back seat for several years while Aguilera struggled to move out of the slums. During this time, he painted mostly for enjoyment, giving away his canvases to friends and relatives while he made his way through school. While at the ''Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico'', Julio enrolled himself in the academy of [[Chan Lee Kam Fai]], one of Venezuela's most renowned martial arts training academies.,<ref name=\"Cham Kam Fai\">{{cite web|title=Hung Sing Choy Lee Fut |work=Maestro Cham Kam Fai |url=http://taichi.cl//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=27 |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822201646/http://www.taichi.cl/ |archivedate=August 22, 2007 }}</ref> unbeknownst Julio, he would later become the future president of the Venezuelan Federation of Chinese Martial Arts and the International Hung Sing Choy Li Fat Chan Kim Fay.<ref name=\"Cham Kam Fai 2\">{{cite web | title=Choy Li Fat Venezuela | work=Historia del estilo Choy Li Fat(C) y Cai Li Fo(M) | url= http://www.angelfire.com/planet/choylifatvenezuela/ | accessdate=September 13, 2007 }}</ref> This decision temporarily separated him from his artistic career due to the success he would enjoy as a martial artist.\n\nIn July, 1978, Aguilera earned the [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in the [[Choy Lay Fut]] [[Kung-Fu]] style,<ref name=\"Certificado 3\">{{cite web|title=La Venciclopedia |work=Julio Aguilera's Black Belt Certificate |url=https://www.venciclopedia.org/index.php?title=Archivo:Certificado_Julio_Aguilera_3.jpg |accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref> and during that and the following year he participated in several international competitions and exhibitions, including the [[Muay Thai]] World Championship in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the Barehand Championship in China and the International Martial Arts Open of [[Puerto Rico]], which he won in 1979. From that year until 1981, he stayed on the Caribbean island, working as a trainer in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], until he was handpicked to co-develop in [[Venezuela]] ''Top Spa Gym'' at the time the most successful gym in [[Caracas]], located in Las Mercedes sector of the city. Two years later, he was part of the Venezuelan Martial Arts team at the [[1983 Pan American Games]] in the same city.\n\nIn 1983, Aguilera met and married Janice Tuohy, an American choreographer working in the local theater and TV industry. With Touht he opened a multidisciplinary academy with dancing and languages training directed by Touht herself and other [[Venezuela]]n professionals such as [[Anita Vivas]], [[Antonio Drija]] and [[Betty Kaplan]]. The academy didn't last a year and in 1984, Julio and his wife moved to the United States.\n\nAfter a brief stay in [[New York City]], in 1985 Julio moved to [[Diamond Bar]], California, and opened another martial arts academy under the name \"Eagle Lighting\". This time, the business was a success and in a few years he opened other branches in [[Marina del Rey]], [[San Jose, California|San Jos\u00e9]] and [[Sacramento]]. It was while he taught [[Martial Arts]] in [[California]] that he won the Bare Hand [[Kung-Fu]] World Championship in August 1987.<ref name=\"certificado 2\">{{cite web|title=La Venciclopedia |work=Certificado de Julio Aguilera |url=https://www.venciclopedia.org/index.php?title=Archivo:Certificado_Julio_Aguilera_2.jpg |accessdate=August 3, 2019 }}</ref> That same month, he was awarded the 6th [[Dan rank#Modern usage in China|Dan]] in China Kung-Fu, [[I Ching]] [[Kung-Fu]] by the [[International Kung Fu Federation]].<ref name=\"certificado\"/>  Despite all those achievements, Aguilera retired from Martial Arts in 1987, closed down the academies and moved to New York City with his wife.

His mother died at birth and he was raised by his grandmother and other relatives. At age 6, he was making a living as a shoe polisher while attending primary school. After graduating from high school in 1978 from the Colegio San Agustin, Julio studied at the [[Universidad Pedag\u00f3gica Experimental Libertador|Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico de Caracas]].\n\nAguilera was inclined towards the arts since he was in primary school, and he began painting at a young age after a local painter gave him a handful of used brushes and half-empty tubes of oil paint.<ref>[http://www.artareas.com/ArtAreas/home.nsf/Profiles/JULIO+AGUILERA Julio Aguilera: A Venezuelan Artist Makes His Mark in North America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410224514/http://artareas.com/ArtAreas/home.nsf/Profiles/JULIO+AGUILERA |date=2007-04-10 }} Ed McCormack. Gallery & Studio, March, 2005</ref> However strong, his artistic inclinations had to take a back seat for several years while Aguilera struggled to move out of the slums. During this time, he painted mostly for enjoyment, giving away his canvases to friends and relatives while he made his way through school. While at the ''Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico'', Julio enrolled himself in the academy of [[Chan Lee Kam Fai]], one of Venezuela's most renowned martial arts training academies.,<ref name=\"Cham Kam Fai\">{{cite web|title=Hung Sing Choy Lee Fut |work=Maestro Cham Kam Fai |url=http://taichi.cl//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=27 |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822201646/http://www.taichi.cl/ |archivedate=August 22, 2007 }}</ref> unbeknownst Julio, he would later become the future president of the Venezuelan Federation of Chinese Martial Arts and the International Hung Sing Choy Li Fat Chan Kim Fay.<ref name=\"Cham Kam Fai 2\">{{cite web | title=Choy Li Fat Venezuela | work=Historia del estilo Choy Li Fat(C) y Cai Li Fo(M) | url= http://www.angelfire.com/planet/choylifatvenezuela/ | accessdate=September 13, 2007 }}</ref> This decision temporarily separated him from his artistic career due to the success he would enjoy as a martial artist.\n\nIn July, 1978, Aguilera earned the [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in the [[Choy Lay Fut]] [[Kung-Fu]] style,<ref name=\"Certificado 3\">{{cite web|title=La Venciclopedia |work=Julio Aguilera's Black Belt Certificate |url=https://www.venciclopedia.org/index.php?title=Archivo:Certificado_Julio_Aguilera_3.jpg |accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref> and during that and the following year he participated in several international competitions and exhibitions, including the [[Muay Thai]] World Championship in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the Barehand Championship in China and the International Martial Arts Open of [[Puerto Rico]], which he won in 1979. From that year until 1981, he stayed on the Caribbean island, working as a trainer in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], until he was handpicked to co-develop in [[Venezuela]] ''Top Spa Gym'' at the time the most successful gym in [[Caracas]], located in Las Mercedes sector of the city. Two years later, he was part of the Venezuelan Martial Arts team at the [[1983 Pan American Games]] in the same city.\n\nIn 1983, Aguilera met and married Janice Tuohy, an American choreographer working in the local theater and TV industry. With Touht he opened a multidisciplinary academy with dancing and languages training directed by Touht herself and other [[Venezuela]]n professionals such as [[Anita Vivas]], [[Antonio Drija]] and [[Betty Kaplan]]. The academy didn't last a year and in 1984, Julio and his wife moved to the United States.\n\nAfter a brief stay in [[New York City]], in 1985 Julio moved to [[Diamond Bar]], California, and opened another martial arts academy under the name \"Eagle Lighting\". This time, the business was a success and in a few years he opened other branches in [[Marina del Rey]], [[San Jose, California|San Jos\u00e9]] and [[Sacramento]]. It was while he taught [[Martial Arts]] in [[California]] that he won the Bare Hand [[Kung-Fu]] World Championship in August 1987.<ref name=\"certificado 2\">{{cite web|title=La Venciclopedia |work=Certificado de Julio Aguilera |url=https://www.venciclopedia.org/index.php?title=Archivo:Certificado_Julio_Aguilera_2.jpg |accessdate=August 3, 2019 }}</ref> That same month, he was awarded the 6th [[Dan rank#Modern usage in China|Dan]] in China Kung-Fu, [[I Ching]] [[Kung-Fu]] by the [[International Kung Fu Federation]].<ref name=\"certificado\"/>  Despite all those achievements, Aguilera retired from Martial Arts in 1987, closed down the academies and moved to New York City with his wife.
