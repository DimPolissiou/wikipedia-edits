Its headquarters is in the main campus in [[Riyadh]], the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]].  It has two other campuses in [[Jeddah]] and [[Hofuf|Al-Ahsa]].\n\n==History==\nThe university was formally established in 2005. The advanced medical facilities at the King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa proved to be critical foundations for the successful inception of the university.\n\nKSAU-HS's main campus is in Riyadh with two additional campuses in Jeddah and Al-Ahsa. The main campus in Riyadh hosts seven colleges: College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Pharmacy, College of Public Health and Health Informatics, College of Applied Medial Sciences, College of Nursing and the College of Science & Health Professions. Jeddah Campus hosts College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences and College of Sciences and Health Professions. Finally, Al-Ahsa Campus hosts College of Applied Medical Sciences, College of Nursing, and College of Sciences and Health Professions.\n\nThe umbrella of NGHA has given the KSAU-HS students access to King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa, which are considered to be the most advanced medical complexes in the region. Furthermore, it has enabled KSAU-HS to enhance its curricula and academic programs with clinical applications and training under health professionals.\n\n==Campuses==\n\n===Riyadh===\nThe campus is in the east of [[Riyadh]] and officially opened in April 2013.<ref name=trolleymotion2013>{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Riad/Riyadh [SA] - Opening of the New Campus of the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University|url=https://old.trolleymotion.eu/index.php?id=38&L=3&n_ID=1783|date=6 May 2013|publisher=TrolleyMotion|accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> Its design is a mix of contemporary and Islamic architecture. The campus has a capacity of ten thousand students, but it can accommodate future increase in student enrolment.\n\nThere is a large landscaping area connecting the buildings with footpaths.  In addition, there is a [[trolleybus]] line that connects the main areas of the campus with the housing compound.<ref name=trolleymotion2013/><ref name=trolleybusmagazine310>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 310 (July\u2013August 2013), p. 110.

It will serve as the hub of a network of medical educators, trainers, and faculty committed to support, develop, and facilitate [[CanMEDS]] in all domain of medical education at both undergraduate, and postgraduate levels, as well as in the professional practice.\t \t\n\nThe center will host and present a series of conferences & workshops on residency training, and develop network of medical educators, and deliver education and training to the trainees in postgraduate medical education programs in [[Saudi Arabia]]. In Nov 2010, KSAU-HS hosted The Saudi Arabian Conference on Residency Education (SACRE). This conference was a landmark event that highlighted the collaboration KSAU-HS has with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

Its headquarters is in the main campus in [[Riyadh]], the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]].  It has two other campuses in [[Jeddah]] and [[Hofuf|Al-Ahsa]].\n\n==History==\nThe university was formally established in 2005. The advanced medical facilities at the King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa proved to be critical foundations for the successful inception of the university.\n\nKSAU-HS's main campus is in Riyadh with two additional campuses in Jeddah and Al-Ahsa. The main campus in Riyadh hosts seven colleges: College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Pharmacy, College of Public Health and Health Informatics, College of Applied Medial Sciences, College of Nursing and the College of Science & Health Professions. Jeddah Campus hosts College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences and College of Sciences and Health Professions. Finally, Al-Ahsa Campus hosts College of Applied Medical Sciences, College of Nursing, and College of Sciences and Health Professions.\n\nThe umbrella of NGHA has given the KSAU-HS students access to King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa, which are considered to be the most advanced medical complexes in the region. Furthermore, it has enabled KSAU-HS to enhance its curricula and academic programs with clinical applications and training under health professionals.\n\n==Campuses==\n\n===Riyadh===\nThe campus is in the east of [[Riyadh]] and officially opened in April 2013.<ref name=trolleymotion2013>{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Riad/Riyadh [SA] - Opening of the New Campus of the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University|url=https://old.trolleymotion.eu/index.php?id=38&L=3&n_ID=1783|date=6 May 2013|publisher=TrolleyMotion|accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> Its design is a mix of contemporary and Islamic architecture. The campus has a capacity of ten thousand students, but it can accommodate future increase in student enrolment.\n\nThere is a large landscaping area connecting the buildings with footpaths.  In addition, there is a [[trolleybus]] line that connects the main areas of the campus with the housing compound.<ref name=trolleymotion2013/><ref name=trolleybusmagazine310>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 310 (July\u2013August 2013), p. 110.

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon. Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as [[Lugh]]. The woman is the [[Loathly lady|sovereignty]] of Ireland, and she serves Conn a meal consisting of an ox's rib {{convert|24|ft|m|-1|disp=x| long (| approximately)}}, and a boar's rib.{{efn|Here, the Irish foot is ''[[wikt:traig|traig]]''.}} When she serves drinks, she asks \"To whom shall this cup be given?\", and Lugh recites a poem which tells Conn how many years he will reign, and the names of the kings who will follow him.

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]].

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon. Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as [[Lugh]].

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]].

At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek encountered [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), now a Polish army officer, who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]], where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99\u2013107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108\u2013118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M.

When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] in August 1944.

Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to  F Section in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.

As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945.

Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 1930, Krystyna married a young businessman, Gustaw Gettlich at the Spiritual Seminary Church in Warsaw. They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour. A subsequent love affair came to naught when the young man's mother refused to consider the penniless divorc\u00e9e as a potential daughter-in-law.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nOne day, on a Zakopane ski slope, Krystyna lost control and was saved by a giant of a man who stepped into her path and stopped her descent.  Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector. He eventually became an author and travelled the world in search of material for his books and articles. He knew Africa well and hoped one day to return there.<ref name=\"Christine p. 24\">M.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek encountered [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), now a Polish army officer, who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]], where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99\u2013107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108\u2013118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M.

Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] in August 1944.

Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to  F Section in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers.

Soon, in [[England]], custom-built racing \"[[yacht]]s\" began to emerge. In 1851, the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] in [[Cowes]] challenged the American yacht ''America''. The race took place in the [[Solent]]. The ''America'' won the race and took the trophy, the [[America's Cup]], back to the US where, held by the [[New York Yacht Club]], it remained until 1983. The cup was then lost to the [[Royal Perth Yacht Club]] of [[Australia]], which entered the ''[[Australia II]]'' into the contest. Meanwhile, yacht racing continued to evolve, with the development of recognised classes of racing yachts, from small [[dinghy sailing|dinghies]] up to huge [[maxi yachts]].\n\nAlthough there are many different types of racing vessels, they can generally be separated into the larger yachts, which are larger and contain facilities for extended voyages, and smaller harbour racing craft such as dinghies and skiffs. Smaller boats are not generally referred to as yachts, although all recreational boats (as opposed to commercial or military vessels) are yachts. These days, [[yacht racing]] and [[dinghy racing]] are common participant sports around the developed world, particularly where favorable wind conditions and access to reasonably sized bodies of water are available. Most yachting is conducted in salt water, but smaller craft can be raced on lakes and even large rivers.\n\n[[Dinghy racing|Dinghy races]] are conducted on sheltered water on smaller craft with crews of between one and three people. The common arrangement for racing boats is the [[sloop]], a boat with one mast. Some dinghies have only one triangular sail, but most have two configured as a [[sloop]]; some dinghies and almost all larger racing boats carry a [[spinnaker]], a large, bulging sail designed for sailing \"with the wind.\"  Most races are conducted between vessels of identical design (\"one design\" racing). In these races, with identical equipment the sailors best able to make use of the ambient conditions win.  \n[[Image:Yacht Antares in Ipswich Marina Suffolk.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A docked [[yacht]]]]\nDinghy designs vary from small, stable, and slow craft for novice sailors to lightweight, high-speed designs that are very difficult for even experienced crews to sail safely and effectively. Australia's [[18ft Skiff|18-foot skiff]] class are the fastest monohull dinghies, reaching speeds of up to 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour) even in relatively light winds. Sailing has a reputation for being a boring spectator sport,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but skiff racing can be very exciting, particularly in unpredictable conditions where crews struggle to keep their boats upright. Various multi-hull racing classes are even faster. Various one-design dinghy classes are raced at the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nLarger yachts are also raced on harbours, but the most prestigious yacht races are point-to-point long distance races on the open ocean. Bad weather makes even finishing such races a considerable test of equipment and willpower, and from time to time boats and sailors are lost at sea. The longest such events are \"round-the-world\" races which can take months to complete, but better-known are events such as the [[Fastnet race]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] along the east coast of Australia.

Many models have a separate \"bidet\" function aimed towards the front for feminine cleansing. The spray toilet seat is common only in Western-style toilets, and is not incorporated in traditional style squat toilets. Some modern Japanese bidet toilets, especially in hotels and public areas, are labeled with pictograms to avoid language problems, and most newer models have a sensor that will refuse to activate the bidet unless someone is sitting on the toilet.[[File:Bidet weiss.jpg|thumb|A modern bidet of the traditional type, available in many [[southern Europe]]an and [[South American]] countries<ref>Roberto Zapperi: ''Zu viel Moralismus macht den K\u00f6rper schmutzig.'', in: FAZ, 24 aprile 2010.</ref>]]\n\n=== Europe and the Americas ===\n{{Further|Bidet}}\nSome people in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] use [[bidet]]s for anal cleansing with water.

{"title_page": "Ad hominem", "text_new": "{{short description|Typically, a fallacious argumentative strategy that attacks the character of the person making the argument. Alternatively, a valid strategy basing arguments on the opponents' own commitments, without endorsing those commitments}}\n{{redirect|Personal attack|the policy on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:No personal attacks}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for \"to the person\"), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is a term is applied to several different types of arguments, most of which are [[Fallacy#Informal fallacy|fallacious]]. Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\n<!--Ancient history-->\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}} Many examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment.\" \n\n<!--Modern era-->\nItalian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\n<!--Hablin and contemporary-->\nOver time, the term acquired a different meaning; by the beginning of the 20th century, it was linked to a logical fallacy, in which a debater, instead of disproving an argument, attacked their opponent. This approach was also poppularized in philosophical textbooks of the mid-20th century, and it was challenged by [[Australian]] philosopher [[Charles Leonard Hamblin]] in the second half of the 20th century. In a detailed work, he suggested that the inclusion of a statement against a person in an argument, does not necessarily make it a fallacious argument, since that particular phrase is not a premise that leads to a conclusion. While Hablin's criticism was not widely accepted, [[Canadian]] philosopher [[Douglas N. Walton]] examined the fallaciousness of the ''ad hominem'' argument even further.{{sfn|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|2015|pp=615-626}} Nowadays, except within specialized philosophical usages, the usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute their argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies Douglas N. Walton argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? No, according to Walton.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association, that is accusing an arguer because of his alleged connection with a discredited person or group, can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy when the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nKey issues on examining an argument whether being an ''ad hominem'' fallacy or not are whether the accusation against the person stands true or not, whether the accusation is relevant to the argument. Also, it should be examined whether the ''ad hominem'' argument shortens or diminishes the counterargument. An example is a dialogue at the court, where the attorney cross-examines an eyewitness, bringing to light the fact that the witness was convicted in the past for lying. If the attorney's conclusion is that the witness is lying, that would be wrong. But if his argument would be that the witness should not be trusted, that would not be a fallacy.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=86-87}}\n\n=== Argument from commitment ===\nThe term ''ad hominem'' is used to refer to a type of valid argument that employs, as a dialectical strategy, the exclusive utilization of the beliefs, convictions, and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against, i.e., arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true. This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedent ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not decent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\". These kinds of attacks are based on the inability of the audience to have a clear view of the statistical percentage of false statements by both parts of the debate.{{sfn|Orkibi|2018|pp=497-498}}\n\n== Criticism as a fallacy ==\nWalton has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=170}} as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|p=34-60}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* \"[[And you are lynching Negroes]]\"\n* [[Appeal to authority]]\n* [[Appeal to emotion]]\n* [[Appeal to motive]]\n* [[Association fallacy]]\n* [[Bulverism]]\n* [[Character assassination]]\n* [[Discrediting tactic]]\n* ''[[Ergo decedo]]''\n* [[Fair Game (Scientology)]]\n* [[Fake news]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Paul Graham (programmer)#Graham's hierarchy of disagreement|Graham's hierarchy of disagreement]]\n* [[Hostile witness]]\n* [[Negative campaigning]]\n* [[Poisoning the well]]\n* [[Presumption of guilt]] \n* [[Race card]]\n* [[Red herring]]\n* [[Reputation]]\n* [[Shooting the messenger]]\n* [[Smear campaign]]\n* [[Straw man]]\n* [[Tone policing]]\n* [[The Art of Being Right]]\n* ''[[Tu quoque]]''\n* [[Whataboutism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-47183-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Copi|first=Irving M.|title=Informal Logic|isbn=978-0-02-324940-2|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Hansen|first= Hans|author-link= |editor-last= Zalta |editor-first= Edward N. |editor-link= Edward N.

Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\n<!--Ancient history-->\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}} Many examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment.\" \n\n<!--Modern era-->\nItalian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\n<!--Hablin and contemporary-->\nOver time, the term acquired a different meaning; by the beginning of the 20th century, it was linked to a logical fallacy, in which a debater, instead of disproving an argument, attacked their opponent. This approach was also poppularized in philosophical textbooks of the mid-20th century, and it was challenged by [[Australian]] philosopher [[Charles Leonard Hamblin]] in the second half of the 20th century. In a detailed work, he suggested that the inclusion of a statement against a person in an argument, does not necessarily make it a fallacious argument, since that particular phrase is not a premise that leads to a conclusion. While Hablin's criticism was not widely accepted, [[Canadian]] philosopher [[Douglas N. Walton]] examined the fallaciousness of the ''ad hominem'' argument even further.{{sfn|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|2015|pp=615-626}} Nowadays, except within specialized philosophical usages, the usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute their argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? No, according to Walton.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association, that is accusing an arguer because of his alleged connection with a discredited person or group, can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy when the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s.

This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedent ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not decent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\". These kinds of attacks are based on the inability of the audience to have a clear view of the statistical percentage of false statements by both parts of the debate.{{sfn|Orkibi|2018|pp=497-498}}\n\n== Criticism as a fallacy ==\nWalton has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=170}} as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|p=34-60}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* \"[[And you are lynching Negroes]]\"\n* [[Appeal to authority]]\n* [[Appeal to emotion]]\n* [[Appeal to motive]]\n* [[Association fallacy]]\n* [[Bulverism]]\n* [[Character assassination]]\n* [[Discrediting tactic]]\n* ''[[Ergo decedo]]''\n* [[Fair Game (Scientology)]]\n* [[Fake news]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Paul Graham (programmer)#Graham's hierarchy of disagreement|Graham's hierarchy of disagreement]]\n* [[Hostile witness]]\n* [[Negative campaigning]]\n* [[Poisoning the well]]\n* [[Presumption of guilt]] \n* [[Race card]]\n* [[Red herring]]\n* [[Reputation]]\n* [[Shooting the messenger]]\n* [[Smear campaign]]\n* [[Straw man]]\n* [[Tone policing]]\n* [[The Art of Being Right]]\n* ''[[Tu quoque]]''\n* [[Whataboutism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-47183-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Copi|first=Irving M.|title=Informal Logic|isbn=978-0-02-324940-2|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Hansen|first= Hans|author-link= |editor-last= Zalta |editor-first= Edward N. |editor-link= Edward N.

The university commenced operations with four colleges:\n* College of Sharia and Fundamentals of Religion;\n* College of [[Arabic Language]];\n* College of Social and Administrative Sciences;\n* College of Education.\n\nOver the years, new colleges were incorporated including female colleges. {{As of|2019}}, there are 29 colleges encompassing many disciplines such as engineering, computer science, and medicine. King Khalid University was needed based on the growing population of the southern region. Previously, higher education students had to attend satellite campuses of other Saudi universities. {{As of|2019}}, King Khalid University serves approximately 60,000 students.\n<ref name=\"kku.edu.sa\">https://www.kku.edu.sa/en/colleges/</ref>\n\nKing Khalid University was recently ranked fourth in overall performance among universities in Saudi Arabia. In the MENA region, King Khalid University was ranked 24th in overall performance in 2019 by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).  At the international level, King Khalid University was recently ranked 448th in QS World University Rankings. As part of the strategic plan, the university objective is to increase its ranking to the top 200 by 2030.<ref>http://www.webometrics.info/en/aw</ref><ref>https://news.kku.edu.sa/ar/2016-10-03/5033/</ref>\n\n===2012 student protests and change of university presidency===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2011\u20132012 Saudi Arabian protests (January\u2013June 2012)}}\nOn 7 March 2012, during the [[2011\u20132012 Saudi Arabian protests]], women students of the University protested against \"injustice and inequality\" and \"discrimination and mistreatment\" by university security staff.

This was impractical at the outset due to the size of the project and the massive infrastructure requirements. Initially, the university occupied buildings in many different locations. In 2011\u201312, the university completed construction of the Guraiger Campus in Abha. This has served and continues to serve as the main campus for all educational and administration. A female campus was built in al-Fara. There are still a few satellite campuses that can operate with a great deal of independence. However, the goal of a single fully integrated facility remains and is in progress.\n \n{{As of|2019}}, a standalone campus for King Khalid University was under construction in al-Fara. This new campus is commonly known as University City. As part of the medical college, plans were made to build a public hospital which would have one of the largest bed capacities in the Middle East. Because of the scope of the construction project, there were many international bidders for the contract. The university, in cooperation with the King Abdullah Institute for Research and Studies and [[King Saud University]], organized a global competitive bidding program for the design, planning, and construction of University City. As one of the most prominent higher education infrastructure projects in the Kingdom, the competition attracted 28 regional, national, and international bidders. To qualify for the bidding process, each company had to prove its capabilities in large scale construction. The infrastructure at University City is substantial. There are two major service buildings that provide electromechanical components and utilities to all the other buildings on the campus. The two service buildings are connected by a service tunnel that is {{cvt|17|km}} in length.\n \nConstruction of University City is being done in seven phases over a period of years, which are:\n \n* Phase 1 \u2013 Arts and Sciences Academic Complex;\n* Phase 2 \u2013 Medical Complex with an 800-bed hospital;\n* Phase 3 \u2013 Administrative Facilities;\n* Phase 4 \u2013  Roads and Utility Infrastructure;\n* Phase 5 \u2013 Sports Complex;\n* Phase 6 \u2013 Faculty Housing;\n* Phase 7 \u2013 Student Housing.\n \nThe construction project is under the auspices of the University Vice Presidency of Projects. Day-to-day supervision is provided by a variety of consultants, sub-contractors, and engineers representing various private firms from across the globe.

On Tuesday 9 January 1419 AH (06/05/1998 AD) HRH Crown Prince ordered the merger of [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University|Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University]] and [[King Saud University]] in the Southern Region into one entity under the new identity of 'King Khalid University'.\n\n==History==\n===1998 creation as a merger===\nKing Khalid University was established in 1998 under the tutelage of the late King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The university commenced operations with four colleges:\n* College of Sharia and Fundamentals of Religion;\n* College of [[Arabic Language]];\n* College of Social and Administrative Sciences;\n* College of Education.\n\nOver the years, new colleges were incorporated including female colleges. {{As of|2019}}, there are 29 colleges encompassing many disciplines such as engineering, computer science, and medicine. King Khalid University was needed based on the growing population of the southern region. Previously, higher education students had to attend satellite campuses of other Saudi universities. {{As of|2019}}, King Khalid University serves approximately 60,000 students.\n<ref name=\"kku.edu.sa\">https://www.kku.edu.sa/en/colleges/</ref>\n\nKing Khalid University was recently ranked fourth in overall performance among universities in Saudi Arabia. In the MENA region, King Khalid University was ranked 24th in overall performance in 2019 by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).  At the international level, King Khalid University was recently ranked 448th in QS World University Rankings. As part of the strategic plan, the university objective is to increase its ranking to the top 200 by 2030.<ref>http://www.webometrics.info/en/aw</ref><ref>https://news.kku.edu.sa/ar/2016-10-03/5033/</ref>\n\n===2012 student protests and change of university presidency===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2011\u20132012 Saudi Arabian protests (January\u2013June 2012)}}\nOn 7 March 2012, during the [[2011\u20132012 Saudi Arabian protests]], women students of the University protested against \"injustice and inequality\" and \"discrimination and mistreatment\" by university security staff.

This was impractical at the outset due to the size of the project and the massive infrastructure requirements. Initially, the university occupied buildings in many different locations. In 2011\u201312, the university completed construction of the Guraiger Campus in Abha. This has served and continues to serve as the main campus for all educational and administration. A female campus was built in al-Fara. There are still a few satellite campuses that can operate with a great deal of independence. However, the goal of a single fully integrated facility remains and is in progress.\n \n{{As of|2019}}, a standalone campus for King Khalid University was under construction in al-Fara. This new campus is commonly known as University City. As part of the medical college, plans were made to build a public hospital which would have one of the largest bed capacities in the Middle East. Because of the scope of the construction project, there were many international bidders for the contract. The university, in cooperation with the King Abdullah Institute for Research and Studies and [[King Saud University]], organized a global competitive bidding program for the design, planning, and construction of University City. As one of the most prominent higher education infrastructure projects in the Kingdom, the competition attracted 28 regional, national, and international bidders. To qualify for the bidding process, each company had to prove its capabilities in large scale construction. The infrastructure at University City is substantial. There are two major service buildings that provide electromechanical components and utilities to all the other buildings on the campus. The two service buildings are connected by a service tunnel that is {{cvt|17|km}} in length.\n \nConstruction of University City is being done in seven phases over a period of years, which are:\n \n* Phase 1 \u2013 Arts and Sciences Academic Complex;\n* Phase 2 \u2013 Medical Complex with an 800-bed hospital;\n* Phase 3 \u2013 Administrative Facilities;\n* Phase 4 \u2013  Roads and Utility Infrastructure;\n* Phase 5 \u2013 Sports Complex;\n* Phase 6 \u2013 Faculty Housing;\n* Phase 7 \u2013 Student Housing.\n \nThe construction project is under the auspices of the University Vice Presidency of Projects. Day-to-day supervision is provided by a variety of consultants, sub-contractors, and engineers representing various private firms from across the globe. King Khalid University Rector, Falleh al-Solamy, took an active leadership role in overseeing the development of the project.

The Endowment Fund Office is composed of an independent governing board, with a professional staff that manages the Fund's operations, resembling those of Harvard Investment Group and the Yale Investment Office. The KFUPM Fund is the first in Saudi Arabia to be professionally managed by specialized finance and investment teams. The mission of the Fund is to be able to provide the necessary financing (up to 30%) the University needs in the future, and cover costs that aren't sponsored by the University's main funds source, The Ministry of Education. In just over five years, the Endowment has grown to be the largest university endowment in Saudi Arabia (relative to the size of KFUPM budget) and was able to raise more than $500 million in financial assets along with real estate assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/Default.aspx#page/12|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}</ref> The Endowment's main investment projects include the establishment of a business park in the north side of the KFUPM campus that includes constructing numerous hotels and office buildings.
