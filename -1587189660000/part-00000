Her interest in other cultures was nurtured during her undergraduate studies as an anthropology major at Columbia University. In 2004 she received an MFA in visual arts from Columbia University. During her art studies, she spent time in Tangier and Assilah, Morocco. The academic and direct exposure to different cultures and locations has been a great influence on L\u00f3pez\u2019s work. Her background in anthropology and her keen observation of urban systems informs her imagery, and her work frequently pushes into the realm of sculpture and installation in the complexity of her printed forms.<ref>https://www.nicolalopez.com/bio</ref><ref>https://tandempress.wisc.edu/project/nicola-lopez/</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nL\u00f3pez has had solo exhibitions and projects with [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; [[Solomon R.
