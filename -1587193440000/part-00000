The [[foundation stock]], a general [[landrace]] of small dogs of the region, are widely found throughout the country, have traditionally been more common in urban areas, and have been a popular companion of Greeks for centuries. This breed is also known as the Small Greek Domestic Dog.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name {{lang|el-Latn|Kokoni}} probably derives from the word {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1}} {{lang|el-Latn|kokona}} which is another word for 'daughter' in [[Modern Greek]]. In past times, the daughter's life was mostly in and around the house, so the Kokoni dog was the 'daughter's dog' or the 'dog for the house', unlike the [[hunting dog]]s or the [[livestock guardian dog]]s.\n\n== Breed History ==\nThe Kokoni dog, originated in Malta and has been a part of Greek life for hundreds of years along with their slightly larger cousins, the [[Alopekis|Alopeki]]'s, a breed once thought to be a different variety of the same breed. The knowledge of their heritage has been lost to history, but ancient wall decorations, vases, coins, and other pottery pieces exhibit images of these little dogs, generally depicted as the companions to women and children, particularly those in the aristocracy. Many of these little dogs have been employed as multipurpose dogs throughout history, particularly for those with more modest means, and they proved effective as hunting dogs, helping to find and capture small game, both mammals and birds, as well as ridding the house and barns of pests and even occasionally helping herd livestock, those that didn\u2019t find a domestic home even managed to survive both in and outside of the Grecian cities. The unrestricted breeding ended up developing into a particularly healthy breed compared to many breeds with no specific disorders that are more prevalent to their breed.  This breed is very popular in and around Greece, but it has little representation outside of its home country and is not yet recognized by the major kennel clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wagwalking.com/breed/kokoni|title=Kokoni {{!}} Dog Breed Facts and Information - Wag!

Nose length less than the length of the skull. Skull circumference slightly smaller than its length.  \n\n====== Height and Weight ======\n[[File:Cadela da ra\u00e7a Kokoni.jpg|thumb|The coat is may be slightly wavy]]This breed of dog is considered to be of a small to medium size. Their height is 24 to 28 centimeters (9.45 to 11.02 inches) for males, and 23 to 27 centimeters (9.05 to 10.63 inches) for females. Their weight ranges from 4 to 8 kilograms (8.81 to 17.63 lb). There is a tolerable deviation of 1 cm for height, and 1 kg for weight, above or below the limits. The tolerable deviation range for height is 23 to 29 cm (9.05 to 11.42 inches) for males, and 22 to 28 cm (8.66 to 11.02 inches) for females. The tolerable deviation range for weight is 3 to 9 kg (6.61 to 19.85 lb). A dog outside the tolerable deviation range for height cannot be considered a full purebred Kokoni, however, a full purebred Kokoni can be over the tolerable deviation range for weight, as this breed is prone to overeating, and weight gain, especially if they are spayed or neutered.   \n\n====== Colors ======\nThis breed comes in a variety of colors and combinations of colors, such as black and tan, blonde, cream, and white. All colors and patterns are acceptable in the breed standard, although some are rarer than others. Some colors, such as black, are dominant, while others, like brown/liver, are recessive. Dilute Kokoni's, such as blue or lilac, are extremely rare. Since dilution and liver are both recessive and relatively rare, Isabella/Lilac is the rarest color of Kokoni.  \n\n====== Coat ======\nThe coat of the Kokoni is of three lengths, and is easy to groom. It can be straight or wavy, but it should always feel silky. The coat is rich, dense and weatherproof. Straight coated Kokoni's are genetically dominant to wavy coated Kokoni's; as such, wavy coated Kokoni's are rarer than straight coated Kokoni's. The coat of the Kokoni will be fully expressed by the time the Kokoni reaches two years of age.  \n\n====== Tail ======\n[[File:Dog tails types.svg|thumb|Kokoni's can have tails like images 4 & 5; at rest they may appear like image 7, without it being a mistake.]]\nThe sickle-shaped tail of the Kokoni is usually long. The dog holds its tail up high, and has an elegant curve. The coat of this dog forms a brush under its tail, often described as a fan or feather tail. It is carried high, forming a semicircle, its tip resting on the back. It is covered with rich hair, forming a tuft. During the stop or rest, it may fall, without it being a mistake. In the tail and back part of the buttocks the dogs coat is even longer with a length of 8-14 cm (3.15 to 5.5 in). The beautiful tail, that the Kokoni fabulously flaunts, can start showing up at around 6 months of age, but will not be full-length until 9 months to 15 months of age. \n\n====== Eyes ======\nThis breed of dog has large eyes which vary in shape from round to more of an almond shape. They are bright and are not deep-set. The color goes with the color of the coat, but they will never be transparent or blue. Known eye color possibilities include, Brown, Dark Brown, Amber, Light Amber, and Hazel.  \n\n====== Ears ======\nTriangular, medium size, drooping and agile. Located relatively high, above the imaginary line of the eye, they are covered by short hair. Some dogs have longer hairs on the outside, from the base to the middle of the ear. Part of the ears or the whole ear, covered by short and smooth hair 1 cm (0.40 in) long or longer. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n====== Muzzle ======\nThe muzzle \"tapers easily to the nose\", and the top-line is level. The nose of the has well-opened nostrils. It is not large compared to the muzzle, and it is moist, flat, and level on the front surface. The jaws are strong, with scissor-bite teeth.\n\n==Health==\nThis is a deep-chested, sturdy, and agile breed, capable of great speeds and valued for its stamina. The breed generally has good longevity and lives into their late teens. Major health issues are not known. \n\n===Temperament===\n\nKokoni's are like all other dogs in that they can display a wide range of temperaments, behaviors, dispositions, and traits. It is important to remember that temperament and personality are unique to each dog, and the following statements are generalities. \n\nKokoni's have a loud, strong bark for their size though they do not bark much. The Kokoni is said to have an even temper and gentle disposition, and to be lively, cheerful, amiable and not generally aggressive or timid. Other behavioral claims are that they enjoy company, though may initially be standoffish with strangers. Breeders and owners alike know that they are intelligent, easily trained, and very devoted to and protective of their keepers.\n\n=== Grooming ===\nComb and brush regularly with a firm bristle brush, and bathe at least once a month, or when necessary. Small Greek Domestic Dogs shed moderately. It's a natural process of the hair growth cycle. Regular brushing reduces the amount of hair that sheds. Seasonal flea treatment is needed, but cutting the dog's hair by a professional groomer isn't necessary. Clean tear ducts with a warm wet wash cloth daily or once a week at minimum. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.koe.gr/index.php/el/greekbreeds/kokoni The Kennel Club of Greece's breed standard]\n\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Greece]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n<!-- Begin Infobox Dogbreed.

His principal works were his two symphonies, the first of which was produced  by [[August Manns]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in 1889, and subsequently performed at a Philharmonic concert, being well received on each occasion, with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' hailing it as \"a masterpiece\". Although not overtly programmatic, its first movement was influenced by a visit to [[Norway]] by Cliffe. It was published by Novello.  His Second Symphony had its first performance at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]] in 1892. Cliffe gave titles to each of its movements: I. At Sunset. II. Night. III.

It is based on ''[[La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias]]'' (1852), a [[Play (theatre)|play]] adapted from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexandre Dumas ''fils'']]. The opera was originally titled ''Violetta'', after the main character. It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at [[La Fenice]] opera house in Venice.\n\nPiave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, \"c.&nbsp;1700\". It was not until the 1880s that the composer's and librettist's original wishes were carried out and \"[[realism (arts)|realistic]]\" productions were staged.{{sfn|Kimbell|2001|p=995}} ''La traviata'' has become immensely popular and is  among the most frequently performed of all operas.<ref>{{cite web |title= Opera Statistics on Operabase |url= http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en |publisher= Operabase |accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Composition history==\n[[File:Verdi-1850s.jpg|thumb|Verdi around 1850]]\nFor Verdi, the years 1851 to 1853 were filled with operatic activity. First, he had agreed with the librettist [[Salvadore Cammarano]] on a subject for what would become ''[[Il trovatore]]'', but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing ''[[Rigoletto]]'', which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after ''Rigoletto''{{'}}s success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice. After Verdi's return from Paris a contract was signed in May 1852, with performances scheduled for March 1853, although no subject was chosen at that time.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Verdi sees ''The Lady of the Camellias'' play===\n\nVerdi and [[Giuseppina Strepponi]] had visited Paris from late 1851 and into March 1852. In February the couple attended a performance of [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexander Dumas]] ''fils''{{'}}s ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]''. As a result of this, Verdi biographer [[Mary Jane Phillips-Matz]] reports, the composer immediately began to compose music for what would later become ''La traviata''.<ref>Phillips-Matz, p. 303</ref> However, [[Julian Budden]] notes that Verdi had probably read the Dumas novel some time before, and, after seeing the play and returning to Italy, \"he was already setting up an ideal operatic cast for it in his mind,\"{{sfn|Budden|1992|p=115}} shown by his dealings with La Fenice. On their return to Italy, the composer had immediately set to work on ''Trovatore'' for the January 1853 premiere in Rome, but at the same time seemed to have ideas for the music for ''Traviata'' in his head.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Composing for Venice===\n[[File:Francesco_Maria_Piave_-_Granger.jpg|thumb|Francesco Maria Piave, librettist of the opera]]\n[[Francesco Maria Piave]] was engaged to write the new libretto and the two men tried to come up with a suitable subject, but the composer complained that his librettist \"had not yet offered him an 'original' or 'provocative' idea\". Writing to Piave, he added that \"I don't want any of those everyday subjects that one can find by the hundreds.\"<ref>Verdi to Piave, 26 July 1852, in Phillips-Matz, p. 318</ref> But at the same time, the composer expressed concern about censorship in Venice, something with which he was very familiar after his dealings with the censors concerning ''Rigoletto''. As the months dragged on into October, it was agreed that Piave would come to Sant'Agata and work with the composer. One subject was chosen, Piave set to work, and then Verdi threw in another idea, which may have been ''La traviata''. However, within a short time, a synopsis was dispatched to Venice under the title of ''Amore e morte'' (''Love and Death'').{{sfn|Budden|1992|pp=116\u2013117}} However, as Budden reveals, Verdi writes to his friend De Sanctis telling him that \"for Venice I'm doing ''La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias'' which will probably be called ''La traviata''. A subject for our own age.\"<ref>Verdi to De Sanctis, 1 January 1853, in {{harvnb|Budden|1992|p=116}}</ref> Although still bogged down at Sant'Agata, Piave was sanguine: \"Everything will turn out fine, and we'll have a new masterpiece from this true wizard of modern harmonies\".<ref name=\"PM\">Piave to Carlo Marzari at La Fenice announcing that the libretto was complete, 20 October 1852, in Phillips-Matz, pp. 319\u2013324</ref>\n\nWhen back at Sant'Agata in late January 1853 Verdi was reminded that his contract called for him to be in Venice within a week or two and for the premiere to be held on the \"first Saturday in March 1853\".<ref>Phillips-Matz, p. 318</ref> However, it soon became clear that a modern-dress staging of the new opera was impossible\u2014the requirement was that it should be set in the 17th century \"in the era of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]\"\u2014and reports from the opening of the season confirmed the limitations of the chosen soprano, the 38-year-old [[Fanny Salvini-Donatelli]] for taking the role of Violetta. Verdi was distraught, for he held on to the notion that the opera could be staged in modern dress\u2014as ''[[Stiffelio]]'' had been done\u2014Piave was sent back to Sant'Agata to no avail: he could not persuade the composer to back down on his insistence that another soprano be secured, yet the 15 January deadline for securing one had come and gone. Verdi was filled with premonitions of disaster upon his arrival in Venice on 21 February for rehearsals and he made his unhappiness clear to the singers.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Traviata.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Poster for the world premiere]]\n\n===19th century===\n\nThe audience jeered at times during the premiere, directing some of their scorn at the casting of soprano Fanny Salvini-Donatelli in the lead role of Violetta. Though she was an acclaimed singer, they considered her to be too old (at 38) and overweight to credibly play a young woman dying of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]. (Verdi had previously attempted to persuade the manager of La Fenice to re-cast the role with a younger woman, but with no success.) Nevertheless, the first act was met with applause and cheering at the end; but in the second act, the audience began to turn against the performance, especially after the singing of the [[baritone]] [[Felice Varesi]] and the [[tenor]] [[Lodovico Graziani]]. The next day, Verdi wrote to his friend [[Emanuele Muzio]] in what has now become perhaps his most famous letter: \"''La traviata'' last night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell.\"<ref>Verdi to Muzio, 7 March 1853, quoted in Loewenberg (1978), column 906: \"''La traviata'' ieri sera fiasco. La colpa \u00e8 mia o dei cantanti? Il tempo giudicher\u00e0\". [https://books.google.com/books?id=XHlLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA167 Translated in Krehbiel (1909), p. 167].</ref>\n\nCoincidentally, as Philips-Matz points out, an Italian translation of the play ''La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias'' was being presented just a short distance from La Fenice.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n{{Multiple images|total_width=270\n|image1=Felice Varesi-1843-detail.jpg|width1=446|height1=499|caption1=[[Felice Varesi]], the first Germont p\u00e8re<br>(Litho: [[Josef Kriehuber]])\n|image2=Lodovico Graziani circa 1845.jpg|width2=245|height2=305|caption2=[[Lodovico Graziani]] c.&nbsp;1845, the first Alfredo}}\nWhile there were demands for productions from impresarios in various Italian cities, Verdi was loathe to allow them unless he could be sure of the strength of the singers, and in spite of their pleas, the composer refused. As Budden notes, it came to be Venice \"that made an honest woman of Violetta\"{{sfn|Budden|1992|p=124}} when Verdi allowed a performance at the [[Teatro San Benedetto]]. Some revisions took place between 1853 and May 1854, mostly affecting acts 2 and 3, but the opera was performed again on 6 May 1854 and was a great success, largely due to [[Maria Spezia-Aldighieri]]'s portrayal of Violetta. \"Then [referring to the La Fenice performances] it was a fiasco; now it has created a furore.

[[Carl d'Unker]])]]\nVioletta Val\u00e9ry, a famed [[courtesan]], throws a lavish party at her Paris [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] to celebrate her recovery from an illness. Gastone, a [[viscount]], has brought with him a friend, Alfredo Germont, a young [[bourgeois]] from a provincial family who has long adored Violetta from afar. While walking to the salon, Gastone tells Violetta that Alfredo loves her, and that while she was ill, he came to her house every day. Alfredo joins them, admitting the truth of Gastone's remarks.\n\nBaron Douphol, Violetta's current lover, waits nearby to escort her to the salon; once there, the Baron is asked to give a toast, but refuses, and the crowd turns to Alfredo, who agrees to sing a [[Brindisi (music)|brindisi]] \u2013 a drinking song (Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: ''[[Libiamo ne' lieti calici]]'' \u2013 \"Let's drink from the joyful cups\").\n\nFrom the next room, the sound of the orchestra is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: ''[[Un d\u00ec, felice, eterea]]'' \u2013 \"One day, happy and ethereal\"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n|title=\"\u00c8 strano! ... Ah, fors'\u00e8 lui\"\n|filename=Lucrezia Bori, Giuseppe Verdi, Ah! fors' e lui (La traviata).ogg\n|description=Act 1 finale, sung by [[Lucrezia Bori]] in 1910 for [[Edison Records]]\n}}\nAfter the guests leave, Violetta wonders if Alfredo could actually be the one in her life (Violetta: ''\u00c8 strano! ... Ah, fors' \u00e8 lui'' \u2013 \"Ah, perhaps he is the one\"). But she concludes that she needs freedom to live her life (Violetta, Alfredo: ''Sempre libera'' \u2013 \"Always free\"). From off stage, Alfredo's voice is heard singing about love as he walks down the street.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Violetta's country house outside Paris''\n\nThree months later,<!-- \"Volaron gi\u00e0 tre lune\" --> Alfredo and Violetta are living together in a peaceful country house outside Paris. Violetta has fallen in love with Alfredo and she has completely abandoned her former life. Alfredo sings of their happy life together (Alfredo: ''De' miei bollenti spiriti / Il giovanile ardore'' \u2013 \"The youthful ardor of my ebullient spirits\"). Annina, the maid, arrives from Paris, and, when questioned by Alfredo, tells him that she went there to sell the horses, carriages and everything owned by Violetta to support their country lifestyle.\n\nAlfredo is shocked to learn this and leaves for Paris immediately to settle matters himself. Violetta returns home and receives an invitation from her friend, Flora, to a party in Paris that evening. Alfredo's father, Giorgio Germont, is announced and demands that she break off her relationship with his son for the sake of his family, since he reveals that Violetta's relationship with Alfredo has threatened his daughter's engagement (Giorgio: ''Pura siccome un angelo, [[wikt:iddio|Iddio]] mi di\u00e8 una figlia'' \u2013 \"Pure as an angel, God gave me a daughter\") because of Violetta's reputation. Meanwhile, he reluctantly becomes impressed by Violetta's nobility, something which he did not expect from a courtesan. She responds that she cannot end the relationship because she loves him so much, but Giorgio pleads with her for the sake of his family. With growing remorse, she finally agrees (Violetta, Giorgio: ''Dite alla giovine, s\u00ec bella e pura,'' \u2013 \"Tell the young girl, so beautiful and pure,\") and says goodbye to Giorgio. In a gesture of gratitude for her kindness and sacrifice, Giorgio kisses her forehead before leaving her weeping alone.\n\nVioletta gives a note to Annina to send to Flora accepting the party invitation and, as she is writing a farewell letter to Alfredo, he enters. She can barely control her sadness and tears; she tells him repeatedly of her unconditional love (Violetta: ''Amami, Alfredo, amami quant'io t'amo'' \u2013 \"Love me, Alfredo, love me as I love you\"). Before rushing out and setting off for Paris, she hands the farewell letter to her servant to give to Alfredo.\n\nSoon, the servant brings the letter to Alfredo and, as soon as he has read it, Giorgio returns and attempts to comfort his son, reminding him of his family in Provence (Giorgio: ''Di Provenza il mar, il suol chi dal cor ti cancell\u00f2?'' \u2013 \"Who erased the sea, the land of Provence from your heart?\"). Alfredo suspects that the Baron is behind his separation with Violetta, and the party invitation, which he finds on the desk, strengthens his suspicions. He decides to confront Violetta at the party. Giorgio tries to stop Alfredo, but he rushes out.\n\n''Scene 2: Party at Flora's house''\n[[File:LaTraviata.jpg|thumb|300px|Act 2, scene 2 from [[Fife Opera]]'s 2004 production]]\nAt the party, the Marquis tells Flora that Violetta and Alfredo have separated, much to the amazement of everyone who had previously seen the happy couple. She calls for the entertainers to perform for the guests (Chorus: ''Noi siamo zingarelle venute da lontano'' \u2013 \"We are gypsy girls who have come from afar\"; ''Di Madride noi siam mattadori'' \u2013 \"We are matadors from Madrid\"). Gastone and his friends join the matadors and sing (Gastone, chorus, dancers: ''\u00c8 Piquillo un bel gagliardo Biscaglino mattador'' \u2013 \"Piquillo is a bold and handsome matador from Biscay\").\n\nVioletta arrives with Baron Douphol. They see Alfredo at the gambling table. When he sees them, Alfredo loudly proclaims that he will take Violetta home with him. Feeling annoyed, the Baron goes to the gambling table and joins him in a game. As they bet, Alfredo wins some large sums until Flora announces that supper is ready. Alfredo leaves with handfuls of money.\n\nAs everyone is leaving the room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron's anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness what he has to say (''Questa donna conoscete?'' \u2013 \"You know this woman?\"). He humiliates and denounces Violetta in front of the guests and then throws his winnings at her feet in payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo: ''Di donne ignobile insultatore, di qua allontanati, ne desti orror!'' (\"Ignoble insulter of women, go away from here, you fill us with horror!\").\n\nIn search of his son, Giorgio enters the hall and, knowing the real significance of the scene, denounces his son's behavior (Giorgio, Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: ''Di sprezzo degno s\u00e8 stesso rende chi pur nell'ira la donna offende.'' \u2013 \"A man, who even in anger, offends a woman renders himself deserving of contempt.\").\n\nFlora and the ladies attempt to persuade Violetta to leave the dining room, but Violetta turns to Alfredo: ''Alfredo, Alfredo, di questo core non puoi comprendere tutto l'amore...'' \u2013 \"Alfredo, Alfredo, you can't understand all the love in this heart...\".\n\n===Act 3===\n''Violetta's bedroom''\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi, La traviata title page - Restoration.jpg|thumb|300px|Cover of a circa 1855 vocal score with an engraving by Leopoldo Ratti]]\nDr. Grenvil tells Annina that Violetta will not live long since her tuberculosis has worsened. Alone in her room, Violetta reads a letter from Alfredo's father telling her that the Baron was only wounded in his duel with Alfredo. He has informed Alfredo of the sacrifice she has made for him and his sister; and he is sending his son to see her as quickly as possible to ask for her forgiveness. But Violetta senses it is too late (Violetta: ''Addio, del passato bei sogni ridenti'' \u2013 \"Farewell, lovely, happy dreams of the past\").\n\nAnnina rushes in the room to tell Violetta of Alfredo's arrival. The lovers are reunited and Alfredo suggests that they leave Paris (Alfredo, Violetta: ''Parigi, o cara, noi lasceremo'' \u2013 \"We will leave Paris, O beloved\").\n\nBut it is too late: she knows her time is up (Alfredo, Violetta: ''Gran Dio!...morir s\u00ec giovane'' \u2013 \"Great God!...to die so young\"). Alfredo's father enters with the doctor, regretting what he has done. After singing a duet with Alfredo, Violetta suddenly revives, exclaiming that the pain and discomfort have left her. A moment later, she dies in Alfredo's arms.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\nThe opera uses an [[orchestra]] with the following [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]: 2 [[flute]]s (fl. 2 doubling [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[cimbasso]], [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[String section|strings]].\n\n[[Banda (opera)|Banda]]: 2 piccolos, A-flat [[piccolo clarinet]], [[E-flat clarinet]], 2 B-flat clarinets, 2 horns, [[flugelhorn]], 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, [[tambourine]], bass drum, [[castanets]], [[harp]], 2 [[double bass]].<ref>{{cite web |title=La traviata |url=https://www.opera-lille.fr/fichier/o_media/9206/media_fichier_fr_dp.la.traviata.pdf |website=www.opera-lille.fr |publisher=Opera Lille |accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\nThe [[Prelude (music)|prelude]] to the opera begins with very soft, very high strings depicting the frail heroine, followed by the main love theme of the opera, which is then played on lower strings while the higher instruments decorate the melody.<ref name=Grove>{{GroveOnline|title=Traviata, La|author= Parker, Roger|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis delicate atmosphere is altered on curtain rise by lively dance tunes in the orchestra. After the famous \"Brindisi\", an offstage [[Banda (opera)|band]] plays a series of waltzes (waltz rhythms pervade the first act of the opera, creating a Parisian atmosphere).<ref name=Grove/> The concluding part of Violetta's solo scene that ends the first act is full of vocal decoration and feverish ornamentation as she swears to stay free (\"Sempre libera\"). These [[coloratura]] effects are not required for the character after the first act.<ref name=Grove/>\n\nThe lengthy and crucial duet between the elder Germont and Violetta in act 2 is multi-sectioned with the music following the changing dramatic situation.<ref name=Grove/>\n\n''La traviata'' is the only one of Verdi's many operas to be set entirely indoors. Unlike ''Il trovatore'', which was composed simultaneously, ''La traviata'' is an intimate piece, full of tender lyricism.

It is based on ''[[La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias]]'' (1852), a [[Play (theatre)|play]] adapted from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexandre Dumas ''fils'']]. The opera was originally titled ''Violetta'', after the main character. It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at [[La Fenice]] opera house in Venice.\n\nPiave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, \"c.&nbsp;1700\". It was not until the 1880s that the composer's and librettist's original wishes were carried out and \"[[realism (arts)|realistic]]\" productions were staged.{{sfn|Kimbell|2001|p=995}} ''La traviata'' has become immensely popular and is  among the most frequently performed of all operas.<ref>{{cite web |title= Opera Statistics on Operabase |url= http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en |publisher= Operabase |accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Composition history==\n[[File:Verdi-1850s.jpg|thumb|Verdi around 1850]]\nFor Verdi, the years 1851 to 1853 were filled with operatic activity. First, he had agreed with the librettist [[Salvadore Cammarano]] on a subject for what would become ''[[Il trovatore]]'', but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing ''[[Rigoletto]]'', which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after ''Rigoletto''{{'}}s success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice. After Verdi's return from Paris a contract was signed in May 1852, with performances scheduled for March 1853, although no subject was chosen at that time.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Verdi sees ''The Lady of the Camellias'' play===\n\nVerdi and [[Giuseppina Strepponi]] had visited Paris from late 1851 and into March 1852. In February the couple attended a performance of [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexander Dumas]] ''fils''{{'}}s ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]''. As a result of this, Verdi biographer [[Mary Jane Phillips-Matz]] reports, the composer immediately began to compose music for what would later become ''La traviata''.<ref>Phillips-Matz, p. 303</ref> However, [[Julian Budden]] notes that Verdi had probably read the Dumas novel some time before, and, after seeing the play and returning to Italy, \"he was already setting up an ideal operatic cast for it in his mind,\"{{sfn|Budden|1992|p=115}} shown by his dealings with La Fenice. On their return to Italy, the composer had immediately set to work on ''Trovatore'' for the January 1853 premiere in Rome, but at the same time seemed to have ideas for the music for ''Traviata'' in his head.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Composing for Venice===\n[[File:Francesco_Maria_Piave_-_Granger.jpg|thumb|Francesco Maria Piave, librettist of the opera]]\n[[Francesco Maria Piave]] was engaged to write the new libretto and the two men tried to come up with a suitable subject, but the composer complained that his librettist \"had not yet offered him an 'original' or 'provocative' idea\". Writing to Piave, he added that \"I don't want any of those everyday subjects that one can find by the hundreds.\"<ref>Verdi to Piave, 26 July 1852, in Phillips-Matz, p. 318</ref> But at the same time, the composer expressed concern about censorship in Venice, something with which he was very familiar after his dealings with the censors concerning ''Rigoletto''. As the months dragged on into October, it was agreed that Piave would come to Sant'Agata and work with the composer. One subject was chosen, Piave set to work, and then Verdi threw in another idea, which may have been ''La traviata''. However, within a short time, a synopsis was dispatched to Venice under the title of ''Amore e morte'' (''Love and Death'').{{sfn|Budden|1992|pp=116\u2013117}} However, as Budden reveals, Verdi writes to his friend De Sanctis telling him that \"for Venice I'm doing ''La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias'' which will probably be called ''La traviata''. A subject for our own age.\"<ref>Verdi to De Sanctis, 1 January 1853, in {{harvnb|Budden|1992|p=116}}</ref> Although still bogged down at Sant'Agata, Piave was sanguine: \"Everything will turn out fine, and we'll have a new masterpiece from this true wizard of modern harmonies\".<ref name=\"PM\">Piave to Carlo Marzari at La Fenice announcing that the libretto was complete, 20 October 1852, in Phillips-Matz, pp. 319\u2013324</ref>\n\nWhen back at Sant'Agata in late January 1853 Verdi was reminded that his contract called for him to be in Venice within a week or two and for the premiere to be held on the \"first Saturday in March 1853\".<ref>Phillips-Matz, p. 318</ref> However, it soon became clear that a modern-dress staging of the new opera was impossible\u2014the requirement was that it should be set in the 17th century \"in the era of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]\"\u2014and reports from the opening of the season confirmed the limitations of the chosen soprano, the 38-year-old [[Fanny Salvini-Donatelli]] for taking the role of Violetta. Verdi was distraught, for he held on to the notion that the opera could be staged in modern dress\u2014as ''[[Stiffelio]]'' had been done\u2014Piave was sent back to Sant'Agata to no avail: he could not persuade the composer to back down on his insistence that another soprano be secured, yet the 15 January deadline for securing one had come and gone. Verdi was filled with premonitions of disaster upon his arrival in Venice on 21 February for rehearsals and he made his unhappiness clear to the singers.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Traviata.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Poster for the world premiere]]\n\n===19th century===\n\nThe audience jeered at times during the premiere, directing some of their scorn at the casting of soprano Fanny Salvini-Donatelli in the lead role of Violetta. Though she was an acclaimed singer, they considered her to be too old (at 38) and overweight to credibly play a young woman dying of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]. (Verdi had previously attempted to persuade the manager of La Fenice to re-cast the role with a younger woman, but with no success.) Nevertheless, the first act was met with applause and cheering at the end; but in the second act, the audience began to turn against the performance, especially after the singing of the [[baritone]] [[Felice Varesi]] and the [[tenor]] [[Lodovico Graziani]]. The next day, Verdi wrote to his friend [[Emanuele Muzio]] in what has now become perhaps his most famous letter: \"''La traviata'' last night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell.\"<ref>Verdi to Muzio, 7 March 1853, quoted in {{harvnb|Loewenberg|1978|loc=column 906}}: \"''La traviata'' ieri sera fiasco. La colpa \u00e8 mia o dei cantanti?

As Budden notes, it came to be Venice \"that made an honest woman of Violetta\"{{sfn|Budden|1992|p=124}} when Verdi allowed a performance at the [[Teatro San Benedetto]]. Some revisions took place between 1853 and May 1854, mostly affecting acts 2 and 3, but the opera was performed again on 6 May 1854 and was a great success, largely due to [[Maria Spezia-Aldighieri]]'s portrayal of Violetta. \"Then [referring to the La Fenice performances] it was a fiasco; now it has created a furore.

[[Carl d'Unker]])]]\nVioletta Val\u00e9ry, a famed [[courtesan]], throws a lavish party at her Paris [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] to celebrate her recovery from an illness. Gastone, a [[viscount]], has brought with him a friend, Alfredo Germont, a young [[bourgeois]] from a provincial family who has long adored Violetta from afar. While walking to the salon, Gastone tells Violetta that Alfredo loves her, and that while she was ill, he came to her house every day. Alfredo joins them, admitting the truth of Gastone's remarks.\n\nBaron Douphol, Violetta's current lover, waits nearby to escort her to the salon; once there, the Baron is asked to give a toast, but refuses, and the crowd turns to Alfredo, who agrees to sing a [[Brindisi (music)|brindisi]] \u2013 a drinking song (Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: ''[[Libiamo ne' lieti calici]]'' \u2013 \"Let's drink from the joyful cups\").\n\nFrom the next room, the sound of the orchestra is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: ''[[Un d\u00ec, felice, eterea]]'' \u2013 \"One day, happy and ethereal\"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n|title=\"\u00c8 strano! ...

Ah, fors' \u00e8 lui'' \u2013 \"Ah, perhaps he is the one\"). But she concludes that she needs freedom to live her life (Violetta, Alfredo: ''Sempre libera'' \u2013 \"Always free\"). From off stage, Alfredo's voice is heard singing about love as he walks down the street.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Violetta's country house outside Paris''\n\nThree months later,<!-- \"Volaron gi\u00e0 tre lune\" --> Alfredo and Violetta are living together in a peaceful country house outside Paris. Violetta has fallen in love with Alfredo and she has completely abandoned her former life. Alfredo sings of their happy life together (Alfredo: ''De' miei bollenti spiriti / Il giovanile ardore'' \u2013 \"The youthful ardor of my ebullient spirits\"). Annina, the maid, arrives from Paris, and, when questioned by Alfredo, tells him that she went there to sell the horses, carriages and everything owned by Violetta to support their country lifestyle.\n\nAlfredo is shocked to learn this and leaves for Paris immediately to settle matters himself. Violetta returns home and receives an invitation from her friend, Flora, to a party in Paris that evening. Alfredo's father, Giorgio Germont, is announced and demands that she break off her relationship with his son for the sake of his family, since he reveals that Violetta's relationship with Alfredo has threatened his daughter's engagement (Giorgio: ''Pura siccome un angelo, [[wikt:iddio|Iddio]] mi di\u00e8 una figlia'' \u2013 \"Pure as an angel, God gave me a daughter\") because of Violetta's reputation. Meanwhile, he reluctantly becomes impressed by Violetta's nobility, something which he did not expect from a courtesan. She responds that she cannot end the relationship because she loves him so much, but Giorgio pleads with her for the sake of his family. With growing remorse, she finally agrees (Violetta, Giorgio: ''Dite alla giovine, s\u00ec bella e pura,'' \u2013 \"Tell the young girl, so beautiful and pure,\") and says goodbye to Giorgio. In a gesture of gratitude for her kindness and sacrifice, Giorgio kisses her forehead before leaving her weeping alone.\n\nVioletta gives a note to Annina to send to Flora accepting the party invitation and, as she is writing a farewell letter to Alfredo, he enters. She can barely control her sadness and tears; she tells him repeatedly of her unconditional love (Violetta: ''Amami, Alfredo, amami quant'io t'amo'' \u2013 \"Love me, Alfredo, love me as I love you\"). Before rushing out and setting off for Paris, she hands the farewell letter to her servant to give to Alfredo.\n\nSoon, the servant brings the letter to Alfredo and, as soon as he has read it, Giorgio returns and attempts to comfort his son, reminding him of his family in Provence (Giorgio: ''Di Provenza il mar, il suol chi dal cor ti cancell\u00f2?'' \u2013 \"Who erased the sea, the land of Provence from your heart?\"). Alfredo suspects that the Baron is behind his separation with Violetta, and the party invitation, which he finds on the desk, strengthens his suspicions. He decides to confront Violetta at the party. Giorgio tries to stop Alfredo, but he rushes out.\n\n''Scene 2: Party at Flora's house''\n[[File:LaTraviata.jpg|thumb|300px|Act 2, scene 2 from [[Fife Opera]]'s 2004 production]]\nAt the party, the Marquis tells Flora that Violetta and Alfredo have separated, much to the amazement of everyone who had previously seen the happy couple. She calls for the entertainers to perform for the guests (Chorus: ''Noi siamo zingarelle venute da lontano'' \u2013 \"We are gypsy girls who have come from afar\"; ''Di Madride noi siam mattadori'' \u2013 \"We are matadors from Madrid\"). Gastone and his friends join the matadors and sing (Gastone, chorus, dancers: ''\u00c8 Piquillo un bel gagliardo Biscaglino mattador'' \u2013 \"Piquillo is a bold and handsome matador from Biscay\").\n\nVioletta arrives with Baron Douphol. They see Alfredo at the gambling table. When he sees them, Alfredo loudly proclaims that he will take Violetta home with him. Feeling annoyed, the Baron goes to the gambling table and joins him in a game. As they bet, Alfredo wins some large sums until Flora announces that supper is ready. Alfredo leaves with handfuls of money.\n\nAs everyone is leaving the room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron's anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness what he has to say (''Questa donna conoscete?'' \u2013 \"You know this woman?\"). He humiliates and denounces Violetta in front of the guests and then throws his winnings at her feet in payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo: ''Di donne ignobile insultatore, di qua allontanati, ne desti orror!'' (\"Ignoble insulter of women, go away from here, you fill us with horror!\").\n\nIn search of his son, Giorgio enters the hall and, knowing the real significance of the scene, denounces his son's behavior (Giorgio, Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: ''Di sprezzo degno s\u00e8 stesso rende chi pur nell'ira la donna offende.'' \u2013 \"A man, who even in anger, offends a woman renders himself deserving of contempt.\").\n\nFlora and the ladies attempt to persuade Violetta to leave the dining room, but Violetta turns to Alfredo: ''Alfredo, Alfredo, di questo core non puoi comprendere tutto l'amore...'' \u2013 \"Alfredo, Alfredo, you can't understand all the love in this heart...\".\n\n===Act 3===\n''Violetta's bedroom''\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi, La traviata title page - Restoration.jpg|thumb|300px|Cover of a circa 1855 vocal score with an engraving by Leopoldo Ratti]]\nDr. Grenvil tells Annina that Violetta will not live long since her tuberculosis has worsened. Alone in her room, Violetta reads a letter from Alfredo's father telling her that the Baron was only wounded in his duel with Alfredo. He has informed Alfredo of the sacrifice she has made for him and his sister; and he is sending his son to see her as quickly as possible to ask for her forgiveness. But Violetta senses it is too late (Violetta: ''Addio, del passato bei sogni ridenti'' \u2013 \"Farewell, lovely, happy dreams of the past\").\n\nAnnina rushes in the room to tell Violetta of Alfredo's arrival. The lovers are reunited and Alfredo suggests that they leave Paris (Alfredo, Violetta: ''Parigi, o cara, noi lasceremo'' \u2013 \"We will leave Paris, O beloved\").\n\nBut it is too late: she knows her time is up (Alfredo, Violetta: ''Gran Dio!...morir s\u00ec giovane'' \u2013 \"Great God!...to die so young\"). Alfredo's father enters with the doctor, regretting what he has done. After singing a duet with Alfredo, Violetta suddenly revives, exclaiming that the pain and discomfort have left her. A moment later, she dies in Alfredo's arms.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\nThe opera uses an [[orchestra]] with the following [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]: 2 [[flute]]s (fl. 2 doubling [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[cimbasso]], [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[String section|strings]].\n\n[[Banda (opera)|Banda]]: 2 piccolos, A-flat [[piccolo clarinet]], [[E-flat clarinet]], 2 B-flat clarinets, 2 horns, [[flugelhorn]], 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, [[tambourine]], bass drum, [[castanets]], [[harp]], 2 [[double bass]].<ref>{{cite web |title=La traviata |url=https://www.opera-lille.fr/fichier/o_media/9206/media_fichier_fr_dp.la.traviata.pdf |website=www.opera-lille.fr |publisher=Opera Lille |accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\nThe [[Prelude (music)|prelude]] to the opera begins with very soft, very high strings depicting the frail heroine, followed by the main love theme of the opera, which is then played on lower strings while the higher instruments decorate the melody.<ref name=Grove>{{GroveOnline|title=Traviata, La|author= Parker, Roger|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis delicate atmosphere is altered on curtain rise by lively dance tunes in the orchestra.

These [[coloratura]] effects are not required for the character after the first act.<ref name=Grove/>\n\nThe lengthy and crucial duet between the elder Germont and Violetta in act 2 is multi-sectioned with the music following the changing dramatic situation.<ref name=Grove/>\n\n''La traviata'' is the only one of Verdi's many operas to be set entirely indoors. Unlike ''Il trovatore'', which was composed simultaneously, ''La traviata'' is an intimate piece, full of tender lyricism. The character of Violetta dominates the work and her music changes as she develops through the drama, from the hectic, almost hysterical coloratura of the first act, to the more dramatic passages of the second, and the spiritual quality of her music as she departs life in act 3.<ref name=Grove/>\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Main|La traviata discography}}\n\n==Film versions==\n* There is a film version of the opera from 1967, with [[Anna Moffo]] as Violetta, [[Franco Bonisolli]] as Alfredo, [[Gino Bechi]] as Giorgio Germont, and the chorus and orchestra of the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]], conducted by [[Giuseppe Patan\u00e8]].

He went on to star as [[Edward Cullen]] in the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|film adaptations]] of the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' novels]], consisting of five films between 2008 and 2012, which earned a combined total of over $3.3 billion worldwide.
