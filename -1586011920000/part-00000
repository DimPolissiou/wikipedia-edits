One way of doing this was by placing restrictions on minority actors, which, in the case of Asian actors, meant that they could usually only get roles as houseboys, cooks, laundrymen, and crazed war enemies, with the rare \"white hero's loyal sidekick\" roles going to the big name actors.

Butterfly acquiesces to his request, and then kills herself as Pinkerton rushes into the house, too late to stop her. In the ''original'' story by Long, Butterfly is on the point of killing herself when the presence of her child reminds her of her Christian conversion, and the story ends with Mr and Mrs Pinkerton arriving at the house the next morning to find it completely empty.\n\n==Early film==\n{{See also|Racism in early American film}}\n\n===''Mr. Wu'' (1913)===\n''[[Mr. Wu]]'' was originally a stage play, written by Harold Owen and Harry M.

Lang continued to play Oriental roles (although not exclusively), and his autobiography was titled ''Mr. Wu Looks Back'' (1940). The first U.S. production opened in New York on October 14, 1914.

Griffith changed Burke's original story to promote a message of tolerance. In Burke's story, the Chinese protagonist is a sordid young Shanghai drifter pressed into naval service, who frequents [[opium]] dens and whorehouses; in the film, he becomes a [[Buddhist]] missionary whose initial goal is to spread the [[dharma]] of the [[Buddha]] and peace (although he is also shown frequenting [[opium dens]] when he is depressed).

Both had won Oscars the previous year; Rainer for her role in ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' and Muni for the lead in ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]''.

So, MGM gave the role of O-lan to a European actress and offered Wong the role of Lotus, the story's villain.

It was based on the [[\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka Strakonice|CZ]] 250 motocross (type 980.5) ridden by [[Jaroslav Falta]] to the runner-up spot in the 1974 [[List of motocross World Championship results|motocross world championship]]. It was sold under the brand name [[Yezdi]]. The bike won several Indian [[rallying|rallies]] and road races. The bike had a 250&nbsp;cc engine with dual [[exhaust system|exhausts]] and a semi-automatic [[clutch]] and Jawa/CZ's trademark integrated gear shifter/kick-starter.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Yezdi Roadking was the successor of the short-lived Yezdi Oilking. The Oilking was the first motorcycle in India to attempt to move away from pre-mixed fuel to a separate oil lube system via an oil pump. The box-like shape on the left hand cover housed the oil pump. Unfortunately this system had a very high failure rate resulting in piston seizures. This resulted in the discontinuation of the Oilking and the birth of the Roadking. The Roadking though, still retained the protuberance on the left engine cover that housed the oil pump in the Oilking.  The Yezdi Roadking was based on the 1974 CZ 250 Falta, where the original [[bore (engines)|bore]] and [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] of {{convert|70|x|64|mm|2|abbr=on}} was retained, but detuned for lower power than its Motocross original. The engine block is smaller than and different from the Yezdi Classic/Model B in appearance. Also the CZ original had a \"Porcupine\" cylinder head, which was used only in the initial models; the cylinder head later reverted to regular straight fin design. The cylinder block (Type 980.5) was from CZ. Just like in the older [[Jawa 353]] Kyvacka and the Yezdi Model B, the Roadking also came with an original Tesla (Czechoslovakian) headlight bulb as standard.\n\n==Frame==\nThe frame is a single frame of [[motocross]] origin and was built out of square tube. The fork was more pronounced with a higher rake angle and came with adjustable [[shock absorber]]s. Rims were 16&nbsp;inches. The motocross and [[ice racing]] origin frame and proper weight balance made handling very easy and agile compared to its rivals in India.\n\n==Engine==\nThe [[cylinder block]] was carried over from the CZ 250 motocross, which had an over-square stroke ratio. [[Carburetor]]s were either Jikov (tickler [[choke valve|choke]]) or Pacco, wherein the former was exclusively for the Roadking while the latter was used for the Classic D250 model. The [[spark plug]]s were cold and the bike also featured a semi-automatic [[clutch]], where a mechanism by the name cam and roller connected to the clutch push rod to engage/disengage the clutch which is unique to this and other Yezdi/Jawa models. The cam and roller is mechanically coupled to the gear selector thereby eliminating the need for a hand-clutch while engaging the gears. The motorcycle featured dual exhaust ports with dual silencers akin to most Jawa motorcycles, but unlike the CZ 250 on which it was based, which featured a single exhaust port. Another unique feature of the bike was that the kick-starter and the gear shared the same shaft as with all Jawa/CZ/Yezdi motorcycles. Once the gear rod is reversed it doubles as a kicker and once started it automatically returns to the original position.\n\n== Models ==\n\n===CB unit models===\n[[File:Yezdi Roadking India.jpg|thumb|An early Yezdi Roadking CB Unit Model]]\nThe bike was silently launched in India in the late 1970s by Ideal Jawa. It had a prominent fuel tank and was finished in signature Jawa maroon and sometimes in black and gold pinstripe, priced slightly higher than the Classic and CL II models. The troublesome [[contact breaker]] ignition was replaced in 1993 with an electronic CDI unit. Until 1989, Roadkings had a provision for adjusting the front fork dampers.\n\n===Oilking===\n[[File:Yezdi Oilking.jpg|thumb|Yezdi OilKing]]\nDuring the late 1970s, another model known as Oil King was also launched which featured an [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]] for the 2T mix with petrol but later production ceased due to rampant issues with fuel pump failure. The prominent protrusion on the left hand side [[Motorcycle transmission|gearbox]] housing was the original location of the pump. Though the model was discontinued, the engine casing found its way into the Roadking and hence all Roadkings have this protrusion even though the oil pump is not included.\n\n===CDI unit models===\nIn 1993, in an effort to increase fuel efficiency and to solve starting problems the CB or [[contact breaker]] ignition units were replaced with CDI electronic ignition units. The livery was also changed. Fuel efficiency was increased by 30%, however the motorcycle's competitors were getting better and with rising fuel prices the sales plummeted until finally it ceased operations in 1996.\n\n===Monarch===\n[[File:Yezdi Monarch.jpg|thumb|Yezdi Monarch]]\nAt the 1996 Auto Expo, Yezdi displayed a model which used the Yezdi 350 Twin frame & fuel tank, and the Roadking engine. The rims were 18&nbsp;inch as opposed to the regular 16&nbsp;inch. However, it sold only in few numbers. Although some attribute its low sales volume to the company's need to get rid of the surplus Yezdi 350 frames that remained in the factory after the Twin was discontinued.\n\n==Indian Motorsports==\nIn road races at [[Sholavaram]], the Roadking ran in its own 250&nbsp;cc class, while in the Indian open class category its main rival was [[Royal Enfield Bullet]] and later the much more powerful [[Rajdoot 350]]. Power was usually increased  to 25+ bhp or beyond for Group E categories where the engine was bored up till 300&nbsp;cc and over-engineered in stock trim. Among prominent racers were C.K. Chinnappa and Somender Singh. In rallies, N. Jagadeeswara Reddy won many rallies until 1980. Then racing couple [[Jagat and Anita Nanjappa]] and [[Thirumal Roy]] won several victories before switching to the [[Rajdoot 350|Rajdoot Yamaha RD350]].

It was based on the [[\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka Strakonice|CZ]] 250 motocross (type 980.5) ridden by [[Jaroslav Falta]] to the runner-up spot in the 1974 [[List of motocross World Championship results|motocross world championship]]. It was sold under the brand name [[Yezdi]]. The bike won several Indian [[rallying|rallies]] and road races. The bike had a 250&nbsp;cc engine with dual [[exhaust system|exhausts]] and a semi-automatic [[clutch]] and Jawa/CZ's trademark integrated gear shifter/kick-starter.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Yezdi Roadking was the successor of the short-lived Yezdi Oilking. The Oilking was the first motorcycle in India to attempt to move away from pre-mixed fuel to a separate oil lube system via an oil pump. The box-like shape on the left hand cover housed the oil pump. Unfortunately this system had a very high failure rate resulting in piston seizures. This resulted in the discontinuation of the Oilking and the birth of the Roadking. The Roadking though, still retained the protuberance on the left engine cover that housed the oil pump in the Oilking.  The Yezdi Roadking was based on the 1974 CZ 250 Falta, where the original [[bore (engines)|bore]] and [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] of {{convert|70|x|64|mm|2|abbr=on}} was retained, but detuned for lower power than its Motocross original. The engine block is smaller than and different from the Yezdi Classic/Model B in appearance. Also the CZ original had a \"Porcupine\" cylinder head, which was used only in the initial models; the cylinder head later reverted to regular straight fin design. The cylinder block (Type 980.5) was from CZ. Just like in the older [[Jawa 353]] Kyvacka and the Yezdi Model B, the Roadking also came with an original Tesla (Czechoslovakian) headlight bulb as standard.\n\n==Frame==\nThe frame is a single frame of [[motocross]] origin and was built out of square tube. The fork was more pronounced with a higher rake angle and came with adjustable [[shock absorber]]s. Rims were 16&nbsp;inches. The motocross and [[ice racing]] origin frame and proper weight balance made handling very easy and agile compared to its rivals in India.\n\n==Engine==\nThe [[cylinder block]] was carried over from the CZ 250 motocross, which had an over-square stroke ratio. [[Carburetor]]s were either Jikov (tickler [[choke valve|choke]]) or Pacco, wherein the former was exclusively for the Roadking while the latter was used for the Classic D250 model. The [[spark plug]]s were cold and the bike also featured a semi-automatic [[clutch]], where a mechanism by the name cam and roller connected to the clutch push rod to engage/disengage the clutch which is unique to this and other Yezdi/Jawa models. The cam and roller is mechanically coupled to the gear selector thereby eliminating the need for a hand-clutch while engaging the gears. The motorcycle featured dual exhaust ports with dual silencers akin to most Jawa motorcycles, but unlike the CZ 250 on which it was based, which featured a single exhaust port. Another unique feature of the bike was that the kick-starter and the gear shared the same shaft as with all Jawa/CZ/Yezdi motorcycles. Once the gear rod is reversed it doubles as a kicker and once started it automatically returns to the original position.\n\n== Models ==\n\n===CB unit models===\n[[File:Yezdi Roadking India.jpg|thumb|An early Yezdi Roadking CB Unit Model]]\nThe bike was silently launched in India in the late 1970s by Ideal Jawa. It had a prominent fuel tank and was finished in signature Jawa maroon and sometimes in black and gold pinstripe, priced slightly higher than the Classic and CL II models. The troublesome [[contact breaker]] ignition was replaced in 1993 with an electronic CDI unit. Until 1989, Roadkings had a provision for adjusting the front fork dampers.\n\n===Oilking===\n[[File:Yezdi Oilking.jpg|thumb|Yezdi OilKing]]\nDuring the late 1970s, another model known as Oil King was also launched which featured an [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]] for the 2T mix with petrol but later production ceased due to rampant issues with fuel pump failure. The prominent protrusion on the left hand side [[Motorcycle transmission|gearbox]] housing was the original location of the pump. Though the model was discontinued, the engine casing found its way into the Roadking and hence all Roadkings have this protrusion even though the oil pump is not included.\n\n===CDI unit models===\nIn 1993, in an effort to increase fuel efficiency and to solve starting problems the CB or [[contact breaker]] ignition units were replaced with CDI electronic ignition units. The livery was also changed. Fuel efficiency was increased by 30%, however the motorcycle's competitors were getting better and with rising fuel prices the sales plummeted until finally it ceased operations in 1996.\n\n===Monarch===\n[[File:Yezdi Monarch.jpg|thumb|Yezdi Monarch]]\nAt the 1996 Auto Expo, Yezdi displayed a model which used the Yezdi 350 Twin frame & fuel tank, and the Roadking engine. The rims were 18&nbsp;inch as opposed to the regular 16&nbsp;inch. However, it sold only in few numbers. Although some attribute its low sales volume to the company's need to get rid of the surplus Yezdi 350 frames that remained in the factory after the Twin was discontinued.\n\n==Indian Motorsports==\nIn road races at [[Sholavaram]], the Roadking ran in its own 250&nbsp;cc class, while in the Indian open class category its main rival was [[Royal Enfield Bullet]] and later the much more powerful [[Rajdoot 350]]. Power was usually increased  to 25+ bhp or beyond for Group E categories where the engine was bored up till 300&nbsp;cc and over-engineered in stock trim. Among prominent racers were C.K. Chinnappa and Somender Singh. In rallies, N. Jagadeeswara Reddy won many rallies until 1980. Then racing couple [[Jagat and Anita Nanjappa]] and [[Thirumal Roy]] won several victories before switching to the [[Rajdoot 350|Rajdoot Yamaha RD350]]. During the early 1990's [[FMSCI]], the sporting federation of India banned two-wheelers above 120&nbsp;cc from rallies thus ending the Roadking's run in motor sports.\n\n==Powergliders==\nThe Roadking engines were a favorite among the hang-glider manufacturers in India. A [[Coimbatore]] based manufacturer headed by late motor racing driver and constructor, [[S.Karivardhan|S.

When the Republic dissolved in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign nation, then formed a short-lived union with [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] called the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which lasted from 1895 to 1898.<ref name=\"Boland2001\">{{cite book|author=Roy Boland|title=Culture and Customs of El Salvador|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola|url-access=registration|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30620-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola/page/2 2]}}</ref><ref name=\"IhrieOropesa2011\">{{cite book|author1=Maureen Ihrie|author2=Salvador Oropesa|title=World Literature in Spanish: An Encyclopedia &#91;3 volumes&#93;: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPDFHE_5besC&pg=PA332|date=20 October 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08083-8|page=332}}</ref><ref name=\"Haskin2012\">{{cite book|author=Jeanne M.

The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\n\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendencia]]'' in 1786.\n\nTowards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas P.

In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\n\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\n\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\n\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - Demographics |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - MIGRATION |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.\n\nPDC leader [[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=T.D. |author2=D.A.

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatit\u00e1n]]]]\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] and [[La Ni\u00f1a]] effects.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name=\"tdfiyp\"/> El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean.<ref name=\"cdkn.org\"/>\n\n====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====\n[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]\nEl Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.\n\nDespite these efforts, much remains to be done.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}\nThe 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n#\nAfter the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Nayib Bukele]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]].\n\n===Political culture===\n{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|[[President of El Salvador]], [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nEl Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Participates in Signing Ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension - 48342132177.jpg|thumb| U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] participates in a signing ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension with Salvadoran President [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nIn November, 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered [[14th Dalai Lama]] by supporting his [[Tibet]]an Government cabinet minister's [[telegram]] requesting an appeal before the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] to stop the Communist [[China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]]'s invasion of Tibet. \"Only the tiny country of El Salvador agreed to sponsor Tibet's plea.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Tibet:Conversations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama|last=Laird|first=Thomas|publisher=Grove Press|year=2006|isbn=9780802118271|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303 303\u2013305]|url=https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303}}</ref>\"At the UN, no one was willing to stand up beside El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |accessdate=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in.

Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de ma\u00edz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatl\u00e1n Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]\n\n[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador.

Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of [[Acajutla]] and waited for Alvarado and his forces.

He thought he would easily defeat this new indigenous force since his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language.<ref name=\"Pan AmericanUnion1934\">{{cite book|author=Lily de Jongh Osborne|title=Index to the Bulletin of the Pan American Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7aobAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA182|series=1-12|volume=LXVII|year=1934|publisher=Pan American Union|page=182|chapter=El Salvador}}</ref>\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of El Salvador did not see the Spanish as gods, but as foreign invaders. Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\n\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendencia]]'' in 1786.\n\nTowards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas P. Anderson |title=Politics in Central America: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uar_iWVhSaIC |accessdate=29 July 2012 |year=1988 |via=Google Books |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-92883-4}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of [[President (government title)|president]]s from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[liberalism|liberal]], generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant [[cash crop]], the development of infrastructure ([[railroad]]s and [[sea port|port facilities]]) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-[[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws to ensure that displaced [[Peasant|campesinos]] and other rural residents provided sufficient [[labour (economics)|labour]] for the coffee fincas ([[plantation]]s), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\n\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\n\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\n\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - Demographics |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - MIGRATION |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.\n\nPDC leader [[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=T.D. |author2=D.A.

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatit\u00e1n]]]]\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] and [[La Ni\u00f1a]] effects.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name=\"tdfiyp\"/> El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean.<ref name=\"cdkn.org\"/>\n\n====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====\n[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]\nEl Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction.\n\nRecent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.{{when|date=July 2016}} In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.\n\nDespite these efforts, much remains to be done.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}\nThe 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n#\nAfter the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Nayib Bukele]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]].\n\n===Political culture===\n{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|[[President of El Salvador]], [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nEl Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Participates in Signing Ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension - 48342132177.jpg|thumb| U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] participates in a signing ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension with Salvadoran President [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nIn November, 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered [[14th Dalai Lama]] by supporting his [[Tibet]]an Government cabinet minister's [[telegram]] requesting an appeal before the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] to stop the Communist [[China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]]'s invasion of Tibet. \"Only the tiny country of El Salvador agreed to sponsor Tibet's plea.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Tibet:Conversations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama|last=Laird|first=Thomas|publisher=Grove Press|year=2006|isbn=9780802118271|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303 303\u2013305]|url=https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303}}</ref>\"At the UN, no one was willing to stand up beside El Salvador.

During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of [[Indigo dye|indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to [[coffee]] as the main export.\n\n[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is an important economic centre of El Salvador and home to the \"Carnival of San Miguel\", one of the biggest festivals of entertainment and food in Central America.<ref name=\"Herrera-Sobek2012\">{{cite book|author=Maria Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&pg=PA459|date=31 July 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=459}}</ref>]]\nThe government has sought to improve the collection of its current [[revenue]]s, with a focus on indirect taxes.

Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion.

In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style = class=\"bonita\" style=\"float:left; margin:0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding:0.5em; font-size:95&nbsp;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Exports to\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imports from\n|-\n!

Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign [[income]] and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archivedate=7 November 2007}}</ref> approximately 16.2% of [[gross domestic product]](GDP).\n\nRemittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |accessdate=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>{{cite news |title=CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=elsalvador.com |date=21 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045947/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref> The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

E. MacDonald.png|thumb|El Salvador has surf tourism due to large waves from the Pacific Ocean.]]\nMost North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador's beaches and nightlife. Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatl\u00e1n Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]\n\n[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador. The [[El Salvador national football team]] qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]].

She is ill-treated there, made to do all the housework, and verbally abused by her aunt. She is made to work as a servant for meager wages in another household, and her earnings are taken away by her aunt. One day, Kashinath is summoned to the Police Station where he is told that since Gauri has been convicted of stealing a necklace from her employer, she is placed under his care for 12 months. Kashinath undertakes to look after her, but she manages to escape, and beats up Bankelal, who had originally accused her of stealing the necklace. The Police are summoned again, and this time Gauri is placed with Shree Satyanand Anathalaya, an orphanage run by a compassionate Manager, Ashok. Gauri revolts against all the rules imposed upon her and she is placed in solitary, where she ends up breaking all the windows and furniture. Then one day she escapes, beats up Bankelal severely, and returns. She is once again placed in solitary. Then Ashok and his associate Murlidhar find out that Bankelal had framed Gauri, and they inform the Police, who make Bankelal confess. In this way, Gauri gets a pardon, and is asked to leave the orphanage, but she refuses to do so and stays on after promising that she will always obey Ashok. When Ashok has a heart attack, she proposes to stay and look after him, but Ashok wants her to leave and marry Murlidhar.

In order to slow Banks' army down, Taylor's men lit the bridge on fire and stopped for a rest.
