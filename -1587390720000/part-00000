The Sabine form of the name was Pompos, not Pomponius as is often supposed, which like Pompilius is a patronymic adjectival formation.</ref> four sons, born on the day of Rome's founding (traditionally, 21 April 753 BC). He lived a severe life of discipline and banished all luxury from his home. [[Titus Tatius]], king of the [[Sabine]]s and a colleague of Romulus, gave in marriage his only daughter, [[Tatia (wife of Numa Pompilius)|Tatia]], to Numa. After 13 years of marriage, Tatia died, precipitating Numa's retirement to the countryside. According to [[Livy]], Numa resided at [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]] immediately before being elected king.<ref name=\"LivyAb\">Livy, ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#18|1:18]].</ref>\n\n[[Titus Livius]] (Livy) and [[Plutarch]] refer to the story that Numa was instructed in philosophy by [[Pythagoras]] but discredit it as chronologically and geographically implausible.<ref name=\"LivyAb\" /> \n\nPlutarch reports that some authors credited him with only a single daughter, [[Pompilia (daughter of Numa Pompilius)|Pompilia]]. Pompilia's mother is variously identified as Numa's first wife Tatia or his second wife [[Lucretia (wife of Numa Pompilius)|Lucretia]]. She is said to have married the future first [[pontifex maximus]] [[Numa Marcius]], and by him gave birth to the future king [[Ancus Marcius]].<ref>E. Peruzzi ''Le origini di Roma'' I. ''La famiglia'' Firenze 1970 p. 142 ff.</ref>\n\nOther authors, according to Plutarch, gave Numa, in addition, five sons, [[Pomponius|Pompo]] (or [[Pomponius]]), Pinus, Calpus, Mamercus, and Numa, from whom the noble families ''([[gens|gentes]])'' of the [[Pomponia (gens)|Pomponii]], [[Pinaria (gens)|Pinarii]], [[Calpurnia (gens)|Calpurnii]], [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], and [[Pompilia (gens)|Pompilii]] respectively traced their descent. Still other writers, writes Plutarch, believed these were fictional genealogies to enhance the status of these families.<ref>{{Citation | last = [[Plutarch]] | title = The Parallel Lives : Numa, ch. 21 | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html}}</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nAfter the death of Romulus, there was an [[interregnum]] of one year in which the [[royal prerogative|royal power]] was exercised by members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in rotation for five days in a row. In 715 BC, after much bickering between the factions of Romulus (the Romans) and Tatius (the Sabines), a compromise was reached, and the Sabine Numa was elected by the senate as the next king.\n\nAt first he refused the offer. His father and Sabine kinsmen, including his teacher and the father of Numa's son-in law, Marcus, along with an embassy of two senators from Rome, banded together to persuade him to accept. In the account of Plutarch and [[Livy]], Numa, after being summoned by the Senate from Cures, was offered the tokens of power amid an enthusiastic reception by the people of Rome. He requested, however, that an [[augur]] should divine the opinion of the gods on the prospect of his kingship before he accepted. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was consulted and the [[omen]]s were favourable.<ref name=\"LivyAb\" /> Thus approved by the Roman and Sabine people as well as the heavens, he took up his position as King of Rome.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, Numa's first act was to disband the personal guard of 300 so-called \"[[Celeres]]\" (the \"Swift\") with which Romulus permanently surrounded himself.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_c\">Plutarch, \"The Parallel Lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7VII\"</ref> The gesture is variously interpreted as self-protection in the face of their questionable loyalty, a sign of humility, or a signal of peace and moderation.\n\nBased on Roman chronology, Numa died of old age in 673 BC. He was succeeded by [[Tullus Hostilius]].\n\n==Agent of the gods==\nNuma was traditionally celebrated by the Romans for his wisdom and piety. In addition to the endorsement by Jupiter, he is supposed to have had a direct and personal relationship with a number of deities, most famously the nymph [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]], who according to legend taught him to be a wise legislator. According to Livy, Numa claimed that he held nightly consultations with Egeria on the proper manner of instituting sacred rites for the city.<ref name=\"LivyAb_a\">[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#19|1:19]]</ref> Plutarch suggests that he played on superstition<ref>Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7VIII\"</ref> to give himself an aura of awe and divine allure, in order to cultivate more gentle behaviours among the warlike early Romans, such as honoring the gods, abiding by law, behaving humanely to enemies, and living proper, respectable lives.\n\nNuma was said to have authored several \"sacred books\" in which he had written down divine teachings, mostly from Egeria and the [[Muse|Muses]]. [[Plutarch]]<ref name=PlutarchXXXV>Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XXII\"</ref> (citing [[Valerius Antias]]) and Livy<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]''</ref> record that at his request he was buried along with these \"sacred books\", preferring that the rules and rituals they prescribed be preserved in the living memory of the state priests, rather than preserved as relics subject to forgetfulness and disuse. About half of these books\u2014Plutarch and Livy differ on their number\u2014were thought to cover the priesthoods he had established or developed, including the ''[[flamen|flamines]]'', ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifices]]'', ''[[Salii]]'', and ''[[fetial]]es'' and their rituals. The  other books dealt with philosophy (''disciplina sapientiae''). According to Plutarch,<ref name=PlutarchXXXV /> these books were recovered some four hundred years later (in reality almost five hundred years, i. e. in 181 BC according to Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 40#29|40:29:3-14]]) at the occasion of a natural accident that exposed the tomb. They were examined by the Senate, deemed to be inappropriate for disclosure to the people, and burned. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]<ref>As noted by Gerard Walter, editor of Plutarch's ''The parallel lives'', La Pl\u00e9\u00efade, volume n\u00b063, 1967.</ref> hints that they were actually kept as a very close secret by the ''pontifices''.\n\nNuma is reputed to have constrained the two minor gods [[Picus]] and [[Faunus]] into delivering some [[prophecy|prophecies]] of things to come.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe\">Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XIV\" and Ovid ''Fasti'' III.</ref>\n\nNuma, supported and prepared by Egeria, reportedly held a battle of wits with Jupiter himself, in an apparition whereby Numa sought to gain a protective ritual against lightning strikes and thunder.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe\" />\n\nOnce, when a plague was ravaging the population, [[Ancile|a brass shield]] fell from the sky and was brought to Numa.  He declared that Egeria had told him it was a gift from Jupiter to be used for Rome's protection.  He ordered ceremonies to give thanks for the gift and quickly brought about an end to the plague. The [[Ancile]] became a sacred relic of the Romans<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_b\">Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XIII\"</ref> and was placed in the care of the [[Salii]].\n\n==Institutions attributed to Numa==\n[[File:Numa Pompilius, from Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum.png|thumb|Numa Pompilius, from [[Guillaume Rouill\u00e9|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]] ]]\nOne of Numa's first acts was the construction of a [[temple of Janus (Roman Forum)|temple of Janus]] as an indicator of peace and war. The temple was constructed at the foot of the Argiletum, a road in the city. After securing peace with Rome's neighbours, the doors of the temples were shut<ref name=\"LivyAb_a\" /> and remained so for the duration of Numa's reign, a unique case in Roman history.\n\nAnother creation attributed to Numa was the cult of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], a god for boundaries. Through this rite, which involved sacrifices at private properties, boundaries and landmarks, Numa reportedly sought to instill in Romans the respect of lawful property and non-violent relationships with neighbours. The cult of Terminus, preached Numa, involved absence of violence and murder. The god was a testament to justice and a keeper of peace.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_a\">Plutarch, \"The Parallel Lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XVI\"</ref> In a somehow comparable,<ref>[[Vegoia and Egeria]]</ref> more moral rather than legal fashion, Numa sought to associate himself with one of the roles of [[Vegoia]] in the  religious system of the neighbouring Etruscans by deciding to set the official boundaries of the territory of Rome, which Romulus had never wanted, presumably with the same concern of preserving peace.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_a\" />\n\nRecognizing the paramount importance of the ''[[Ancile]]'', King Numa had eleven matching shields made,<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_b\" /> so perfect that no one, even Numa, could distinguish the original from the copies. These shields were the ''Ancilia'', the sacred shields of Jupiter, which were carried each year in a procession by the [[Salii]] priests. Numa also established the office and duties of [[Pontifex Maximus]] and instituted (Plutarch's version<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_c\" />) the [[flamen]] of Quirinus, in honour of Romulus, in addition to those of Jupiter and Mars that already existed. Numa also brought the [[Vestal Virgins]] to Rome from [[Alba Longa]].<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#20|1:20]]</ref> Plutarch adds that they were then at the number of two, were later augmented to four by Servius Tullius and stayed so through the ages.\n\nBy tradition, Numa promulgated a [[Roman calendar#Calendar of Numa|calendar reform]] that adjusted the solar and lunar years, introducing the months of January and February.<ref name=\"LivyAb_a\" />\n\nIn other Roman institutions established by Numa, Plutarch thought he detected a [[Laconia]]n influence, attributing the connection to the Sabine culture of Numa, for \"Numa was descended of the Sabines, who declare themselves to be a colony of the [[Lacedaemonians]].\"\n\nLivy and Dionysius give a largely concordant picture of the vast founding work carried out by Numa concerning Roman religion and religious institutions. Livy's account is concise: it occupies the whole chapters 20 and 21 of his first book.\n\nLivy begins with the priesthoods which Numa established.\n\nHe created a residentiary flamen to Jupiter endowed with regal insignia, who could carry out the sacred functions of the royal office, which usually he himself discharged: he did so to avoid the neglect of the rites whenever the king went to war, for he saw the warlike attitude of the Romans. He also created the flamines of Mars and Quirinus, the Vestal virgins, who were salaried by the state treasury, the twelfth Salii of Mars Gradivus with their peculiar custom and ritual. Then he chose Numa Marcius as  pontiff. To him he bestowed all the sacred ceremonies, his books and seals. The following words of this passage have been considered a systematic summary exposition of Roman religion:\n\n<blockquote>quibus hostiis, quibus diebus, ad quae templa sacra fierent atque unde in eos sumptus pecunia erogaretur. Cetera quoque omnia publica privataque sacra pontificis scitis subiecit, ut esset quo consultum plebes veniret, ne quid divini iuris negligendo patrios ritus peregrinosque adsciscendo turbaretur. Nec celestes modo caerimonias sed iusta quoque funebria placandosque manes ut idem pontificem edoceret, quaeque prodigia fulminibus a Iove quo visu missa susciperentur atque curarentur.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>...[showing] with what victims, upon what days, and at what temples the sacred rites were to be performed, and from what funds the money was to be taken to defray the expenses. He also placed all other religious institutions, public and private, under the control of the decrees of the pontiff, to the end that there might be some authority to whom the people should come to ask advice, to prevent any confusion in the divine worship being caused by their neglecting the ceremonies of their own country, and adopting foreign ones. He further ordained that the same pontiff should instruct the people not only in the ceremonies connected with the heavenly deities, but also in the due performance of funeral solemnities, and how to appease the shades of the dead; and what [[Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#prodigium|prodigies]] sent by lightning or any other phenomenon were to be attended to and expiated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Livius |first=Titus |date=1904 |title=Ab Urbe Condita |trans-title=Roman History, Books I-III |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10828/pg10828.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLivy lists the ''hostiae'', victims, as the first competence of the pontiffs: following come the days, temples, money, other sacred ceremonies, funerals and prodigies. The potential for classification inherent in this text has been remarked by  modern historians of Roman religion, even though some, as Bouch\u00e9-Leclercq, think of a tripartite structure, rather than a division into five (Turchi) or seven parts (Peruzzi). At any rate it is an important document of pontifical derivation that establishes a sort of hierarchic order of competences.\n \nLivy continues saying Numa dedicated an altar to Jupiter Elicius as the source of religious knowledge and consulted the god by means of auguries as to what should be expiated; instituted a yearly festival to ''Fides'' (Faith) and commanded the three major flamines to be carried to her temple in an arched chariot and to perform the service with their hands wrapt up to the fingers, meaning Faith had to be sacred as in men's right hand; among many other rites he instituted he dedicated places of the Argei.\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] devotes much more space to Numa's religious reforms. In his account the institution of eight priesthoods is attributed to Numa: ''curiones'', ''flamines'', ''celeres'', augurs, vestals, ''salii'', fetials, pontiffs.  However, the space he devotes to the description of these priesthoods and the official duties they discharged is very uneven. He says only a few words about the ''curiones'', who were in charge of tending the sacrifices of the ''curiae''; the ''flamines''; the ''tribuni celerum'',<ref>Fasti Praenestini  II 13, 2, 123 Degrassi as cited by Capdeville. Marcus Iunius Brutus the founder of the Roman Republic was able to call the ''comitia'' exactly for the reason that his office of ''tribunus celerum'' entitled him to do so.</ref> who were the bodyguard of the king but who also took part in some religious ceremonies; and the augurs, who were in charge of official divination. He devotes much more attention to the last four priesthoods of his list, particularly the vestals and the ''salii''.\n\nHis minute prescriptions about the ceremonies and sacrifices were certainly written down in order to remember them correctly. Plutarch records some of these<ref>Plutarch ''Numa'' 14, 6-7.</ref> such as sacrificing an uneven number of victims to the heavenly gods and an even number to the nether gods; the prohibition of making libations to the gods with wine; the prohibition of sacrificing without flour; the necessity of making a complete turn on oneself while praying and worshiping the gods.\n\nThe ritual of the ''[[spolia opima]]'' is ascribed to Numa too by ancient sources.\n\nFinally [[Arnobius]] states the [[indigitamenta]] were attributed to him.\n\nNuma was credited with dividing the immediate territory of Rome into ''pagi'' and establishing the traditional occupational guilds of Rome:\n:\"So, distinguishing the whole people by the several arts and trades, he formed the companies of musicians, goldsmiths, carpenters, dyers, shoemakers, skinners, braziers, and potters; and all other handicraftsmen he composed and reduced into a single company, appointing every one their proper courts, councils, and observances.\" (Plutarch)\n\nPlutarch, in like manner, tells of the early religion of the Romans, that it was imageless and spiritual. He says Numa \"forbade the Romans to represent the deity in the form either of man or of beast. Nor was there among them formerly any image or statue of the Divine Being; during the first one hundred and seventy years they built temples, indeed, and other sacred domes, but placed in them no figure of any kind; persuaded that it is impious to represent things Divine by what is perishable, and that we can have no conception of God but by the understanding\".\n\n[[William Blackstone]] says that Numa may be credited with \"originally inventing\" [[corporations]]: \"They were introduced, as Plutarch says, by Numa; who finding, upon his accession, the city torn to pieces by the two rival factions of Sabines, and Romans, thought it a prudent and politic measure, to subdivide these two into many smaller ones, by instituting separate societies of every manual trade and profession.\"<ref>1 Bl. Comm. 456-7</ref>\n\n==Story of the books of Numa==\nLivy narrates that, in 181BC, while digging in the field of the ''scriba'' L. Petilius at the foot of the [[Ianiculum]], peasants found two stone coffers, eight  feet long and four feet wide, inscribed both in Latin and in Greek characters, one stating that Numa Pompilus, son of Pompon, king of the Romans was buried (there) and the other that Numa's books were inside it. When Petilius after the advice of his friends opened it, the one that was inscribed with the name of the king was found empty, the other containing two bundles each of seven books, not complete but looking very recent, seven in Latin dealing with pontifical law and seven in Greek of philosophy as it was in that remote past.\n\nThe books were shown to other people and the fact became public. Praetor Q. Petilius, who was friends with L. Petilius, requested them, found them very dangerous to religion and told Lucius he would have them burnt, but he allowed him to try and recover them by legal or other means. The scriba brought the case to the tribunes of the plebs, and the tribunes in turn brought it to the senate. The praetor declared he was ready to swear an oath that it was not a good thing either to read or to store those books, and the senate deliberated that the offer of the oath was sufficient by itself, that the books be burnt on the ''Comitium'' as soon as possible and that an indemnity fixed by the praetor and the tribunes be paid to the owner. L. Petilius though declined to accept the sum. The books were burnt by the ''victimarii''.\n\nThe action of the praetor has been seen as politically motivated, and in accord with the Catonian reaction of those years.<ref>F. Sini ''Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica. I. Libri e commentari'' Sassari 1983 p. 22 n. 75.</ref> It is relevant though that some of the annalists of those times or only a few years later, do not seem to show any doubt about the authenticity of the books.<ref>The sources on the episode are collected in G. Garbarino ''Roma e la filosofia greca dalle origini alla fine del II secolo a. C.'' Torino 1973 I pp. 64 ff.</ref> The whole incident has been critically analyzed again by philologist E. Peruzzi, who by comparing the different versions, strives to demonstrate the overall authenticity of the books.<ref>E. Peruzzi ''Origini di Roma'' II. ''Le lettere'' Bologna 1973 pp. 107 ff. as cited by Sini.</ref> By contrast, M.J. Pena's position is more reserved and critical.<ref>M. J. Pena \"La tumba y los libros de Numa\" in ''Faventia'' '''1''' 1979  pp. 211 ff. as cited by Sini.</ref>\n\nFrancophone scholars A. Delatte and J. Carcopino believe the incident to be the result of a real initiative of the pythagoric sect of Rome.<ref>A. Delatte \"Les doctrines  pythagoriciennes des livres de Numa\" in ''Acad\u00e9mie royale de Belgique, Bulletin de la classe de la classe des lettres et des sciences morales et politiques'' '''22''' 1936  pp. 19-40; J.

The Sabine form of the name was Pompos, not Pomponius as is often supposed, which like Pompilius is a patronymic adjectival formation.</ref> four sons, born on the day of Rome's founding (traditionally, 21 April 753 BC). He lived a severe life of discipline and banished all luxury from his home. [[Titus Tatius]], king of the [[Sabine]]s and a colleague of Romulus, gave in marriage his only daughter, [[Tatia (wife of Numa Pompilius)|Tatia]], to Numa. After 13 years of marriage, Tatia died, precipitating Numa's retirement to the countryside. According to [[Livy]], Numa resided at [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]] immediately before being elected king.<ref name=\"LivyAb\">Livy, ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#18|1:18]].</ref>\n\n[[Titus Livius]] (Livy) and [[Plutarch]] refer to the story that Numa was instructed in philosophy by [[Pythagoras]] but discredit it as chronologically and geographically implausible.<ref name=\"LivyAb\" /> \n\nPlutarch reports that some authors credited him with only a single daughter, [[Pompilia (daughter of Numa Pompilius)|Pompilia]]. Pompilia's mother is variously identified as Numa's first wife Tatia or his second wife [[Lucretia (wife of Numa Pompilius)|Lucretia]]. She is said to have married the future first [[pontifex maximus]] [[Numa Marcius]], and by him gave birth to the future king [[Ancus Marcius]].<ref>E. Peruzzi ''Le origini di Roma'' I. ''La famiglia'' Firenze 1970 p. 142 ff.</ref>\n\nOther authors, according to Plutarch, gave Numa, in addition, five sons, [[Pomponius|Pompo]] (or [[Pomponius]]), Pinus, Calpus, Mamercus, and Numa, from whom the noble families ''([[gens|gentes]])'' of the [[Pomponia (gens)|Pomponii]], [[Pinaria (gens)|Pinarii]], [[Calpurnia (gens)|Calpurnii]], [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], and [[Pompilia (gens)|Pompilii]] respectively traced their descent. Still other writers, writes Plutarch, believed these were fictional genealogies to enhance the status of these families.<ref>{{Citation | last = [[Plutarch]] | title = The Parallel Lives : Numa, ch. 21 | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html}}</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nAfter the death of Romulus, there was an [[interregnum]] of one year in which the [[royal prerogative|royal power]] was exercised by members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in rotation for five days in a row. In 715 BC, after much bickering between the factions of Romulus (the Romans) and Tatius (the Sabines), a compromise was reached, and the Sabine Numa was elected by the senate as the next king.\n\nAt first he refused the offer. His father and Sabine kinsmen, including his teacher and the father of Numa's son-in law, Marcus, along with an embassy of two senators from Rome, banded together to persuade him to accept. In the account of Plutarch and [[Livy]], Numa, after being summoned by the Senate from Cures, was offered the tokens of power amid an enthusiastic reception by the people of Rome. He requested, however, that an [[augur]] should divine the opinion of the gods on the prospect of his kingship before he accepted. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was consulted and the [[omen]]s were favourable.<ref name=\"LivyAb\" /> Thus approved by the Roman and Sabine people as well as the heavens, he took up his position as King of Rome.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, Numa's first act was to disband the personal guard of 300 so-called \"[[Celeres]]\" (the \"Swift\") with which Romulus permanently surrounded himself.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_c\">Plutarch, \"The Parallel Lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7VII\"</ref> The gesture is variously interpreted as self-protection in the face of their questionable loyalty, a sign of humility, or a signal of peace and moderation.\n\nBased on Roman chronology, Numa died of old age in 673 BC. He was succeeded by [[Tullus Hostilius]].\n\n==Agent of the gods==\nNuma was traditionally celebrated by the Romans for his wisdom and piety. In addition to the endorsement by Jupiter, he is supposed to have had a direct and personal relationship with a number of deities, most famously the nymph [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]], who according to legend taught him to be a wise legislator. According to Livy, Numa claimed that he held nightly consultations with Egeria on the proper manner of instituting sacred rites for the city.<ref name=\"LivyAb_a\">[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#19|1:19]]</ref> Plutarch suggests that he played on superstition<ref>Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7VIII\"</ref> to give himself an aura of awe and divine allure, in order to cultivate more gentle behaviours among the warlike early Romans, such as honoring the gods, abiding by law, behaving humanely to enemies, and living proper, respectable lives.\n\nNuma was said to have authored several \"sacred books\" in which he had written down divine teachings, mostly from Egeria and the [[Muse|Muses]]. [[Plutarch]]<ref name=PlutarchXXXV>Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XXII\"</ref> (citing [[Valerius Antias]]) and Livy<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]''</ref> record that at his request he was buried along with these \"sacred books\", preferring that the rules and rituals they prescribed be preserved in the living memory of the state priests, rather than preserved as relics subject to forgetfulness and disuse. About half of these books\u2014Plutarch and Livy differ on their number\u2014were thought to cover the priesthoods he had established or developed, including the ''[[flamen|flamines]]'', ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifices]]'', ''[[Salii]]'', and ''[[fetial]]es'' and their rituals. The  other books dealt with philosophy (''disciplina sapientiae''). According to Plutarch,<ref name=PlutarchXXXV /> these books were recovered some four hundred years later (in reality almost five hundred years, i. e. in 181 BC according to Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 40#29|40:29:3-14]]) at the occasion of a natural accident that exposed the tomb. They were examined by the Senate, deemed to be inappropriate for disclosure to the people, and burned. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]<ref>As noted by Gerard Walter, editor of Plutarch's ''The parallel lives'', La Pl\u00e9\u00efade, volume n\u00b063, 1967.</ref> hints that they were actually kept as a very close secret by the ''pontifices''.\n\nNuma is reputed to have constrained the two minor gods [[Picus]] and [[Faunus]] into delivering some [[prophecy|prophecies]] of things to come.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe\">Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XIV\" and Ovid ''Fasti'' III.</ref>\n\nNuma, supported and prepared by Egeria, reportedly held a battle of wits with Jupiter himself, in an apparition whereby Numa sought to gain a protective ritual against lightning strikes and thunder.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe\" />\n\nOnce, when a plague was ravaging the population, [[Ancile|a brass shield]] fell from the sky and was brought to Numa.  He declared that Egeria had told him it was a gift from Jupiter to be used for Rome's protection.  He ordered ceremonies to give thanks for the gift and quickly brought about an end to the plague. The [[Ancile]] became a sacred relic of the Romans<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_b\">Plutarch, \"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XIII\"</ref> and was placed in the care of the [[Salii]].\n\n==Institutions attributed to Numa==\n[[File:Numa Pompilius, from Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum.png|thumb|Numa Pompilius, from [[Guillaume Rouill\u00e9|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]] ]]\nOne of Numa's first acts was the construction of a [[temple of Janus (Roman Forum)|temple of Janus]] as an indicator of peace and war. The temple was constructed at the foot of the Argiletum, a road in the city. After securing peace with Rome's neighbours, the doors of the temples were shut<ref name=\"LivyAb_a\" /> and remained so for the duration of Numa's reign, a unique case in Roman history.\n\nAnother creation attributed to Numa was the cult of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], a god for boundaries. Through this rite, which involved sacrifices at private properties, boundaries and landmarks, Numa reportedly sought to instill in Romans the respect of lawful property and non-violent relationships with neighbours. The cult of Terminus, preached Numa, involved absence of violence and murder. The god was a testament to justice and a keeper of peace.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_a\">Plutarch, \"The Parallel Lives, Numa Pompilius, \u00a7XVI\"</ref> In a somehow comparable,<ref>[[Vegoia and Egeria]]</ref> more moral rather than legal fashion, Numa sought to associate himself with one of the roles of [[Vegoia]] in the  religious system of the neighbouring Etruscans by deciding to set the official boundaries of the territory of Rome, which Romulus had never wanted, presumably with the same concern of preserving peace.<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_a\" />\n\nRecognizing the paramount importance of the ''[[Ancile]]'', King Numa had eleven matching shields made,<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_b\" /> so perfect that no one, even Numa, could distinguish the original from the copies. These shields were the ''Ancilia'', the sacred shields of Jupiter, which were carried each year in a procession by the [[Salii]] priests. Numa also established the office and duties of [[Pontifex Maximus]] and instituted (Plutarch's version<ref name=\"PlutarchThe_c\" />) the [[flamen]] of Quirinus, in honour of Romulus, in addition to those of Jupiter and Mars that already existed. Numa also brought the [[Vestal Virgins]] to Rome from [[Alba Longa]].<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#20|1:20]]</ref> Plutarch adds that they were then at the number of two, were later augmented to four by Servius Tullius and stayed so through the ages.\n\nBy tradition, Numa promulgated a [[Roman calendar#Calendar of Numa|calendar reform]] that adjusted the solar and lunar years, introducing the months of January and February.<ref name=\"LivyAb_a\" />\n\nIn other Roman institutions established by Numa, Plutarch thought he detected a [[Laconia]]n influence, attributing the connection to the Sabine culture of Numa, for \"Numa was descended of the Sabines, who declare themselves to be a colony of the [[Lacedaemonians]].\"\n\nLivy and Dionysius give a largely concordant picture of the vast founding work carried out by Numa concerning Roman religion and religious institutions. Livy's account is concise: it occupies the whole chapters 20 and 21 of his first book.\n\nLivy begins with the priesthoods which Numa established.\n\nHe created a residentiary flamen to Jupiter endowed with regal insignia, who could carry out the sacred functions of the royal office, which usually he himself discharged: he did so to avoid the neglect of the rites whenever the king went to war, for he saw the warlike attitude of the Romans. He also created the flamines of Mars and Quirinus, the Vestal virgins, who were salaried by the state treasury, the twelfth Salii of Mars Gradivus with their peculiar custom and ritual. Then he chose Numa Marcius as  pontiff. To him he bestowed all the sacred ceremonies, his books and seals. The following words of this passage have been considered a systematic summary exposition of Roman religion:\n\n<blockquote>quibus hostiis, quibus diebus, ad quae templa sacra fierent atque unde in eos sumptus pecunia erogaretur. Cetera quoque omnia publica privataque sacra pontificis scitis subiecit, ut esset quo consultum plebes veniret, ne quid divini iuris negligendo patrios ritus peregrinosque adsciscendo turbaretur. Nec celestes modo caerimonias sed iusta quoque funebria placandosque manes ut idem pontificem edoceret, quaeque prodigia fulminibus a Iove quo visu missa susciperentur atque curarentur.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>...[showing] with what victims, upon what days, and at what temples the sacred rites were to be performed, and from what funds the money was to be taken to defray the expenses. He also placed all other religious institutions, public and private, under the control of the decrees of the pontiff, to the end that there might be some authority to whom the people should come to ask advice, to prevent any confusion in the divine worship being caused by their neglecting the ceremonies of their own country, and adopting foreign ones. He further ordained that the same pontiff should instruct the people not only in the ceremonies connected with the heavenly deities, but also in the due performance of funeral solemnities, and how to appease the shades of the dead; and what [[Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#prodigium|prodigies]] sent by lightning or any other phenomenon were to be attended to and expiated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Livius |first=Titus |date=1904 |title=Ab Urbe Condita |trans-title=Roman History, Books I-III |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10828/pg10828.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLivy lists the ''hostiae'', victims, as the first competence of the pontiffs: following come the days, temples, money, other sacred ceremonies, funerals and prodigies. The potential for classification inherent in this text has been remarked by  modern historians of Roman religion, even though some, as Bouch\u00e9-Leclercq, think of a tripartite structure, rather than a division into five (Turchi) or seven parts (Peruzzi). At any rate it is an important document of pontifical derivation that establishes a sort of hierarchic order of competences.\n \nLivy continues saying Numa dedicated an altar to Jupiter Elicius as the source of religious knowledge and consulted the god by means of auguries as to what should be expiated; instituted a yearly festival to ''Fides'' (Faith) and commanded the three major flamines to be carried to her temple in an arched chariot and to perform the service with their hands wrapt up to the fingers, meaning Faith had to be sacred as in men's right hand; among many other rites he instituted he dedicated places of the Argei.\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] devotes much more space to Numa's religious reforms. In his account the institution of eight priesthoods is attributed to Numa: ''curiones'', ''flamines'', ''celeres'', augurs, vestals, ''salii'', fetials, pontiffs.  However, the space he devotes to the description of these priesthoods and the official duties they discharged is very uneven. He says only a few words about the ''curiones'', who were in charge of tending the sacrifices of the ''curiae''; the ''flamines''; the ''tribuni celerum'',<ref>Fasti Praenestini  II 13, 2, 123 Degrassi as cited by Capdeville. Marcus Iunius Brutus the founder of the Roman Republic was able to call the ''comitia'' exactly for the reason that his office of ''tribunus celerum'' entitled him to do so.</ref> who were the bodyguard of the king but who also took part in some religious ceremonies; and the augurs, who were in charge of official divination. He devotes much more attention to the last four priesthoods of his list, particularly the vestals and the ''salii''.\n\nHis minute prescriptions about the ceremonies and sacrifices were certainly written down in order to remember them correctly. Plutarch records some of these<ref>Plutarch ''Numa'' 14, 6-7.</ref> such as sacrificing an uneven number of victims to the heavenly gods and an even number to the nether gods; the prohibition of making libations to the gods with wine; the prohibition of sacrificing without flour; the necessity of making a complete turn on oneself while praying and worshiping the gods.\n\nThe ritual of the ''[[spolia opima]]'' is ascribed to Numa too by ancient sources.\n\nFinally [[Arnobius]] states the [[indigitamenta]] were attributed to him.\n\nNuma was credited with dividing the immediate territory of Rome into ''pagi'' and establishing the traditional occupational guilds of Rome:\n:\"So, distinguishing the whole people by the several arts and trades, he formed the companies of musicians, goldsmiths, carpenters, dyers, shoemakers, skinners, braziers, and potters; and all other handicraftsmen he composed and reduced into a single company, appointing every one their proper courts, councils, and observances.\" (Plutarch)\n\nPlutarch, in like manner, tells of the early religion of the Romans, that it was imageless and spiritual. He says Numa \"forbade the Romans to represent the deity in the form either of man or of beast. Nor was there among them formerly any image or statue of the Divine Being; during the first one hundred and seventy years they built temples, indeed, and other sacred domes, but placed in them no figure of any kind; persuaded that it is impious to represent things Divine by what is perishable, and that we can have no conception of God but by the understanding\".\n\n[[William Blackstone]] says that Numa may be credited with \"originally inventing\" [[corporations]]: \"They were introduced, as Plutarch says, by Numa; who finding, upon his accession, the city torn to pieces by the two rival factions of Sabines, and Romans, thought it a prudent and politic measure, to subdivide these two into many smaller ones, by instituting separate societies of every manual trade and profession.\"<ref>1 Bl. Comm. 456-7</ref>\n\n==Story of the books of Numa==\nLivy narrates that, in 181BC, while digging in the field of the ''scriba'' L. Petilius at the foot of the [[Ianiculum]], peasants found two stone coffers, eight  feet long and four feet wide, inscribed both in Latin and in Greek characters, one stating that Numa Pompilus, son of Pompon, king of the Romans was buried (there) and the other that Numa's books were inside it. When Petilius after the advice of his friends opened it, the one that was inscribed with the name of the king was found empty, the other containing two bundles each of seven books, not complete but looking very recent, seven in Latin dealing with pontifical law and seven in Greek of philosophy as it was in that remote past.\n\nThe books were shown to other people and the fact became public. Praetor Q. Petilius, who was friends with L. Petilius, requested them, found them very dangerous to religion and told Lucius he would have them burnt, but he allowed him to try and recover them by legal or other means. The scriba brought the case to the tribunes of the plebs, and the tribunes in turn brought it to the senate. The praetor declared he was ready to swear an oath that it was not a good thing either to read or to store those books, and the senate deliberated that the offer of the oath was sufficient by itself, that the books be burnt on the ''Comitium'' as soon as possible and that an indemnity fixed by the praetor and the tribunes be paid to the owner. L. Petilius though declined to accept the sum. The books were burnt by the ''victimarii''.\n\nThe action of the praetor has been seen as politically motivated, and in accord with the Catonian reaction of those years.<ref>F. Sini ''Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica. I. Libri e commentari'' Sassari 1983 p. 22 n. 75.</ref> It is relevant though that some of the annalists of those times or only a few years later, do not seem to show any doubt about the authenticity of the books.<ref>The sources on the episode are collected in G. Garbarino ''Roma e la filosofia greca dalle origini alla fine del II secolo a. C.'' Torino 1973 I pp. 64 ff.</ref> The whole incident has been critically analyzed again by philologist E.

The territory has been divided between the two countries since 1920, with [[South Jutland County|Northern Schleswig]] in Denmark and [[Southern Schleswig]] in Germany. The region is also called '''Sleswick''' in English.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:AreasSettlementSchleswig-HolsteinText.png|thumb|right|Germanic and Slavonic settlement areas in Schleswig/Southern Jutland and Holstein (from 800 to 1100)]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Schleswig interreg.gif|right|thumb|240px|The contemporary transnational ''[[Euroregion]]'' [[S\u00f8nderjylland]]-Schleswig covers most of historical Schleswig.]] -->\n[[File:Folkesprogene i Hertugd\u00f8mmet Slesvig.png|thumb|right|240px|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig]]\nFrom early medieval times, the area's significance lay in being the buffer province of Scandinavia and the Danish Realm towards the powerful [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the south, as well as being a transit area for the transfer of goods between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], connecting the trade route through [[Russia]] with the trade routes along the [[Rhine]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast (see also [[Kiel Canal]]).\n\n===Early history===\nRoman sources place the homeland of the tribe of [[Jutes]] north of the river [[Eider River|Eider]] and that of the [[Angles]] south of it. The Angles in turn bordered the neighbouring [[Saxons]]. By the early Middle Ages, the region was inhabited by three groups:\n*[[Danes]] (including assimilated [[Jutes]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}), who lived north of the [[Danevirke]] and the [[Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay]],\n*[[North Frisians]], who lived in most of [[North Frisia]], including on the [[North Frisian Islands]], and\n*[[Saxons]] (including [[Germanized]] [[Wagrians]] and [[Wends]]), who lived in the area south of the Danes and the Frisians.\n\nDuring the 14th century, the population on Schwansen began to speak Low German alongside Danish,<ref>Peter Treschow Hanson: ''Reise durch einen Theil von Sachsen und D\u00e4nemark'', Altona 1813, p. 44</ref> but otherwise the ethno-linguistic borders remained remarkably stable until around 1800, with the exception of the population in the towns that became increasingly German from the 14th century onwards.\n\nDuring the early [[Viking Age]], [[Haithabu]] \u2013 Scandinavia's biggest trading centre \u2013 was located in this region, which is also the location of the interlocking fortifications known as the [[Danevirke|''Danewerk'' or ''Danevirke'']]. Its construction, and  in particular its great expansion around 737, has been interpreted as an indication of the emergence of a unified Danish state.<ref>Michaelsen, Karsten Kjer, \"Politikens bog om Danmarks oldtid\", Politikens Forlag (1. bogklubudgave), 2002, {{ISBN|87-00-69328-6}}, pp. 122-123 {{in lang|da}}</ref> In May 1931, scientists of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] announced that they had unearthed eighteen Viking graves with the remains of eighteen men in them. The discovery came during excavations in Schleswig. The skeletons indicated that the men were bigger proportioned than twentieth-century Danish men. Each of the graves was laid out from east to west. Researchers surmised that the bodies were entombed in wooden coffins originally, but only the iron nails remained.<ref>\"Viking Find Reported\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 1931, p. 5.</ref> Towards the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]], Schleswig formed part of the historical [[Lands of Denmark]] as Denmark unified out of a number of petty chiefdoms in the 8th to 10th centuries in the wake of Viking expansion.\n\nThe southern boundary of Denmark in the region of the [[Eider River]] and the Danevirke was a source of continuous dispute. The [[Treaty of Heiligen]] was signed in 811 between the Danish [[King Hemming]] and [[Charlemagne]], by which the border was established at the Eider. During the 10th century, there were several wars between [[East Francia]] and Denmark. In 1027, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] and [[Canute the Great]] again fixed their mutual border at the Eider.<ref>Meyers Konversationslexikon, 4th edition (1885-90), entry: \"Eider\"  [http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/Meyers2/seite/werk/meyers/band/5/seite/0369/meyers_b5_s0369.html] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nIn 1115, King [[Niels of Denmark|Niels]] created his nephew [[Canute Lavard]] \u2013 a son of his predecessor [[Eric I of Denmark|Eric I]] \u2013 [[Earl]] of Schleswig, a title used for only a short time before the recipient began to style himself [[Duke]].<ref>Danmarkshistoriens hvorn\u00e5r skete det, Copenhagen: Politiken, 1966, p. 65 {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1230s, Southern Jutland (the Duchy of Slesvig) was allotted as an [[appanage]] to [[Abel of Denmark|Abel Valdemarsen]], Canute's great-grandson, a younger son of [[Valdemar II of Denmark]]. Abel, having wrested the Danish throne to himself for a brief period, left his duchy to his sons and their successors, who pressed claims to the throne of Denmark for much of the next century, so that the Danish kings were at odds with their cousins, the dukes of Slesvig. Feuds and marital alliances brought the Abel dynasty into a close connection with the German [[Holstein-Gl\u00fcckstadt|Duchy of Holstein]] by the 15th century.

A central element of the German nationalistic claim was the insistence on Schleswig and Holstein being a single, indivisible entity.

Its construction, and  in particular its great expansion around 737, has been interpreted as an indication of the emergence of a unified Danish state.<ref>Michaelsen, Karsten Kjer, \"Politikens bog om Danmarks oldtid\", Politikens Forlag (1. bogklubudgave), 2002, {{ISBN|87-00-69328-6}}, pp. 122-123 {{in lang|da}}</ref> In May 1931, scientists of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] announced that they had unearthed eighteen Viking graves with the remains of eighteen men in them.

The [[Treaty of Heiligen]] was signed in 811 between the Danish [[King Hemming]] and [[Charlemagne]], by which the border was established at the Eider. During the 10th century, there were several wars between [[East Francia]] and Denmark.

Abel, having wrested the Danish throne to himself for a brief period, left his duchy to his sons and their successors, who pressed claims to the throne of Denmark for much of the next century, so that the Danish kings were at odds with their cousins, the dukes of Slesvig.

Northern Schleswig was, after the 1920 plebiscites, officially named the Southern Jutland districts (''de s\u00f8nderjyske landsdele''), while Southern Schleswig then remained a part of the Prussian province, which became the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in 1946.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coat of arms of Schleswig]]\n*[[Danevirke]]\n*[[German Bight]]\n*[[Jutland]]\n*[[Hedeby]]\n*[[History of Schleswig-Holstein]]\n*[[North Frisian Islands]]\n*[[Schleswig-Holstein Question]]\n*[[Traditional districts of Denmark]]\n*[[Region S\u00f8nderjylland-Schleswig]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|55|10|N|9|15|E|source:kolossus-nowiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schleswig, Duchy of}}\n[[Category:Duchy of Schleswig| ]]\n[[Category:1866 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1058]]\n[[Category:History of Schleswig-Holstein]]\n[[Category:Duchies of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Divided regions]]\n", "name_user": "Alphathon", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Schleswig"}

The most extensive studies focused on the Saturn C-3B variants before the end of 1962, when lunar orbit rendezvous was selected and Saturn C-5 development approved. The common theme of these variants is the first stage with at least 3,044,000 lbf (13,540 kN) of sea-level thrust (SL). These designs used two or three Rocketdyne [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engine]]s in a [[S-IB]]-2 or [[S-IC]] stage and diameters ranging from 8 to 10 meters (27 to 33 feet) that could lift up to {{convert|110000|lb}} to Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\n\nThe lack of a Saturn C-3 launch vehicle in 1965 created a large payload gap (LEO) between the [[Saturn IB]]'s 21,000 kg (46,000 lb) capacity and the two-stage Saturn V's 75,000 kg (165,000 lb) capability.  In the mid-1960s NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) initiated several studies for a launch vehicle to fill this payload capacity gap and to extend the capabilities of the Saturn family. Three companies provided proposals to MSFC for this requirement: Martin Marietta (builder of Atlas, Titan vehicles), Boeing (builder of S-1B and S-1C first stages), and North American (builder of the S-II second stage).\n\n===Saturn C-3B===\nThe '''Saturn C-3B''' revision (1961) increased the total thrust of the three stages to 17,200&nbsp;kN. The diameter of the first stage (S-IB-2) was increased to 33 feet (10 meters). The eventual first stage for the Saturn V (S-IC) would use this same diameter, but add 8 meters to its length. A further consideration added a third F-1 engine to the first stage.\n\nThe S-II, second stage diameter would be 8.3 meters (326 inches) and 21.3 meters (70 feet) in length. The S-IV, third stage diameter would be 5.5 meters and 12.2 meters in length.\n\n===Saturn C-3BN===\n{{main|NERVA}}\nThe '''Saturn C-3BN''' revision (1961) would use the [[NERVA]] for the third stage in this launch vehicle. The NERVA technology has been studied and proposed since mid-1950s for future space exploration.\n\n[[File:INT20C.svg|thumbnail|Saturn INT-20C, Boeing proposal (1966)]]\n\n===Saturn INT-20===\n{{main|Saturn INT-20}}\nOn 7 October 1966, Boeing submitted a Final Report to the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, \"Studies of Improved Saturn V Vehicles and Intermediate Payload Vehicles\". That report outlined the '''Saturn INT-20''', an intermediate two-stage launch vehicle with an S-1C first stage using three or four F-1 engines, and an S-IVB as the second stage with one J-2 engine. The vehicle's payload capacity for LEO would be 45,000 to 60,000&nbsp;kg, comparable to the earlier Saturn C-3 design (1961). Boeing projected delivery and first flight in 1970, based on a decision by 1967.\n\n==Post-Apollo development==\nThe need for a launch vehicle of Saturn C-3 capacity (45 tonnes to LEO) continued beyond the Apollo program. [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37]], initially designed to serve the Saturn I and I-B, was planned for eventual Saturn C-3 usage, but it was deactivated in 1972. In 2001, Boeing refurbished the complex for its [[Delta IV]] EELV launch vehicle. The Delta IV Heavy variant can only launch 22.5 tonnes to LEO.\n \nThe 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and 2010 [[Space Launch System]] program resulted in renewed proposals for Saturn C-3 derivatives using the Rocketdyne F-1A engines with existing booster cores and tooling (10m - Saturn [[S-IC]] stage; 8.4m - [[Space Shuttle external tank]]; 5.1m - [[Common Booster Core|Delta IV Common Booster Core]]).\n\n===Jarvis===\n{{main|Jarvis (rocket)}}\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], the United States Air Force (USAF) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted a joint [[Advanced Launch System]] study (1987-1990). Hughes Aircraft and Boeing dusted off the earlier Saturn C-3 design and submitted their proposal for the [[Jarvis (rocket)|Jarvis]] launch vehicle.  \n\nThe Jarvis would be a three-stage rocket, 58&nbsp;m (190&nbsp;ft) in height and 8.38&nbsp;m (27.5&nbsp;ft) in diameter. Designed to lift 38 tons to LEO, it would utilize F-1 and J-2 rocket engines and tooling in storage from the Saturn V rocket program along with more recent Shuttle-era technologies to provide lower launch costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jarvis.htm|title=Jarvis launch vehicle|publisher=Astronautix.com|date=|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Pyrios===\nPyrios is an advanced booster concept proposed in 2012 by [[Dynetics]] for use on NASA's [[Space Launch System]] heavy-lift launch vehicle. Pyrios was intended to use the [[RP-1]]/[[LOX]] [[Rocketdyne F-1#F-1B booster|F-1B]], a modernized version of the F-1A engine built by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Developed during the later stages of the Apollo program, the F-1A was test-fired but never flew. Several were created and stored by Rocketdyne. The company has also maintained an F-1/F-1A knowledge retention program for its engineers for the entire period the engine has been mothballed. Dynetics is now performing tests on engine components pulled from storage. Pyrios was intended to use the same attachment points as the five-segment SRBs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1204/18dynetics/|title=Rocket companies hope to repurpose Saturn 5 engines|publisher=Spaceflight Now|author=Stephen Clark|date=18 April 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe Dynetics booster would attach at these points and apply thrust to an upper thrust beam in the SLS core, rather than at the bottom.

The most extensive studies focused on the Saturn C-3B variants before the end of 1962, when lunar orbit rendezvous was selected and Saturn C-5 development approved. The common theme of these variants is the first stage with at least 3,044,000 lbf (13,540 kN) of sea-level thrust (SL). These designs used two or three Rocketdyne [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engine]]s in a [[S-IB]]-2 or [[S-IC]] stage and diameters ranging from 8 to 10 meters (27 to 33 feet) that could lift up to {{convert|110000|lb}} to Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\n\nThe lack of a Saturn C-3 launch vehicle in 1965 created a large payload gap (LEO) between the [[Saturn IB]]'s 21,000 kg (46,000 lb) capacity and the two-stage Saturn V's 75,000 kg (165,000 lb) capability.  In the mid-1960s NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) initiated several studies for a launch vehicle to fill this payload capacity gap and to extend the capabilities of the Saturn family. Three companies provided proposals to MSFC for this requirement: Martin Marietta (builder of Atlas, Titan vehicles), Boeing (builder of S-1B and S-1C first stages), and North American (builder of the S-II second stage).\n\n===Saturn C-3B===\nThe '''Saturn C-3B''' revision (1961) increased the total thrust of the three stages to 17,200&nbsp;kN. The diameter of the first stage (S-IB-2) was increased to 33 feet (10 meters). The eventual first stage for the Saturn V (S-IC) would use this same diameter, but add 8 meters to its length. A further consideration added a third F-1 engine to the first stage.\n\nThe S-II, second stage diameter would be 8.3 meters (326 inches) and 21.3 meters (70 feet) in length. The S-IV, third stage diameter would be 5.5 meters and 12.2 meters in length.\n\n===Saturn C-3BN===\n{{main|NERVA}}\nThe '''Saturn C-3BN''' revision (1961) would use the [[NERVA]] for the third stage in this launch vehicle. The NERVA technology has been studied and proposed since mid-1950s for future space exploration.\n\n[[File:INT20C.svg|thumbnail|Saturn INT-20C, Boeing proposal (1966)]]\n\n===Saturn INT-20===\n{{main|Saturn INT-20}}\nOn 7 October 1966, Boeing submitted a Final Report to the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, \"Studies of Improved Saturn V Vehicles and Intermediate Payload Vehicles\". That report outlined the '''Saturn INT-20''', an intermediate two-stage launch vehicle with an S-1C first stage using three or four F-1 engines, and an S-IVB as the second stage with one J-2 engine. The vehicle's payload capacity for LEO would be 45,000 to 60,000&nbsp;kg, comparable to the earlier Saturn C-3 design (1961). Boeing projected delivery and first flight in 1970, based on a decision by 1967.\n\n==Post-Apollo development==\nThe need for a launch vehicle of Saturn C-3 capacity (45 tonnes to LEO) continued beyond the Apollo program. [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37]], initially designed to serve the Saturn I and I-B, was planned for eventual Saturn C-3 usage, but it was deactivated in 1972. In 2001, Boeing refurbished the complex for its [[Delta IV]] EELV launch vehicle. The Delta IV Heavy variant can only launch 22.5 tonnes to LEO.\n \nThe 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and 2010 [[Space Launch System]] program resulted in renewed proposals for Saturn C-3 derivatives using the Rocketdyne F-1A engines with existing booster cores and tooling (10m - Saturn [[S-IC]] stage; 8.4m - [[Space Shuttle external tank]]; 5.1m - [[Common Booster Core|Delta IV Common Booster Core]]).\n\n===Jarvis===\n{{main|Jarvis (rocket)}}\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], the United States Air Force (USAF) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted a joint [[Advanced Launch System]] study (1987-1990). Hughes Aircraft and Boeing dusted off the earlier Saturn C-3 design and submitted their proposal for the [[Jarvis (rocket)|Jarvis]] launch vehicle.  \n\nThe Jarvis would be a three-stage rocket, 58&nbsp;m (190&nbsp;ft) in height and 8.38&nbsp;m (27.5&nbsp;ft) in diameter. Designed to lift 38 tons to LEO, it would utilize F-1 and J-2 rocket engines and tooling in storage from the Saturn V rocket program along with more recent Shuttle-era technologies to provide lower launch costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jarvis.htm|title=Jarvis launch vehicle|publisher=Astronautix.com|date=|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Pyrios===\nPyrios is an advanced booster concept proposed in 2012 by [[Dynetics]] for use on NASA's [[Space Launch System]] heavy-lift launch vehicle. Pyrios was intended to use the [[RP-1]]/[[LOX]] [[Rocketdyne F-1#F-1B booster|F-1B]], a modernized version of the F-1A engine built by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Developed during the later stages of the Apollo program, the F-1A was test-fired but never flew. Several were created and stored by Rocketdyne. The company has also maintained an F-1/F-1A knowledge retention program for its engineers for the entire period the engine has been mothballed. Dynetics is now performing tests on engine components pulled from storage. Pyrios was intended to use the same attachment points as the five-segment SRBs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1204/18dynetics/|title=Rocket companies hope to repurpose Saturn 5 engines|publisher=Spaceflight Now|author=Stephen Clark|date=18 April 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe Dynetics booster would attach at these points and apply thrust to an upper thrust beam in the SLS core, rather than at the bottom. Like Saturn C-3 first stage, the proposed Dynetics booster would employ two F-1(A) heritage engines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/dynetics-pwr-liquidize-sls-booster-competition-f-1-power/|title=Dynetics and PWR aiming to liquidize SLS booster competition with F-1 power|publisher=Spaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|date=9 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/new-f-1b-rocket-engine-upgrades-apollo-era-deisgn-with-1-8m-lbs-of-thrust/|title=New F-1B rocket engine upgrades Apollo-era design with 1.8M lbs of thrust|publisher=ars technica|author=Lee Hutchinson|date=14 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe manager of NASA's SLS advanced development office indicated that Pyrios proposal was viable.<ref name=spacereview_SLS_BII>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2217/1 |title=SLS Block II drives hydrocarbon engine research |work= thespacereview.com |date= January 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe planned 2015 competition in support of SLS Block 1A, was cancelled after a study determined that the advanced booster would have resulted in unsuitably high acceleration,<ref name=\"NSFWindTunnel1B072012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/wind-tunnel-testing-sls-configurations-block-1b/|title=Wind Tunnel testing conducted on SLS configurations, including Block 1B |date= |website=NASASpaceFlight.com}}</ref>.
