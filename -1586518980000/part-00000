In some countries, these terms may be used with specific meanings: for example, an office may be a subdivision of a department or ministry.\n\n==Examples==\n===Canada===\nIn [[Structure of the Canadian federal government|Canada]], five of the ten provincial governments use the term \"ministry\" to describe their departments ([[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Alberta]]) but the other five, as well as the federal government, use the term \"department\". Despite the difference in nomenclature, both the provincial and federal governments use the term \"minister\" to describe the head of a ministry or department.  The specific task assigned to a minister is referred to as his or her \"portfolio\".\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|British government departments}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all government organisations that consist of civil servants, and which may or [[non-ministerial government department|may not]] be headed by a government minister or [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|secretary of state]], are considered to be [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|departments]]. Until 2018, the term \"ministry\" had been retained only for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]. On 8 January 2018, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that the Department of Communities and Local Government would be renamed at the [[Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government]] to emphasise her government's prioritising of housing policy.\n\n===Other countries===\nSome countries, such as [[Federal administration of Switzerland|Switzerland]], the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippines]] and the [[United States federal executive departments|United States]], do not use or no longer use the term \"ministry\"  and instead call their main government bodies \"departments\".\n\nIn [[Government of Australia#Departments|Australia]] at the Federal level, and also at the State level, the term \"Ministry\" refers to the ministerial office held by a member of Government, the executive, which is then responsible for one or more Departments, the top division of the public service. The collection of Departments responsible to a ministerial office and hence the Minister, is referred to as the Minister's \"portfolio\".\n\n[[New Zealand]]'s state agencies include many ministries and a smaller number of departments. Increasingly, state agencies are styled neither as ministries nor as departments. All New Zealand agencies are under the direction of one or more ministers or associate ministers, whether they are styled \"ministries\" or not.

In some countries, these terms may be used with specific meanings: for example, an office may be a subdivision of a department or ministry.\n\n==Examples==\n===Canada===\nIn [[Structure of the Canadian federal government|Canada]], five of the ten provincial governments use the term \"ministry\" to describe their departments ([[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Alberta]]) but the other five, as well as the federal government, use the term \"department\". Despite the difference in nomenclature, both the provincial and federal governments use the term \"minister\" to describe the head of a ministry or department.  The specific task assigned to a minister is referred to as his or her \"portfolio\".\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|British government departments}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all government organisations that consist of civil servants, and which may or [[non-ministerial government department|may not]] be headed by a government minister or [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|secretary of state]], are considered to be [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|departments]]. Until 2018, the term \"ministry\" had been retained only for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]. On 8 January 2018, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that the Department of Communities and Local Government would be renamed at the [[Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government]] to emphasise her government's prioritising of housing policy.\n\n===Other countries===\nSome countries, such as [[Federal administration of Switzerland|Switzerland]], the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippines]] and the [[United States federal executive departments|United States]], do not use or no longer use the term \"ministry\"  and instead call their main government bodies \"departments\".\n\nIn [[Government of Australia#Departments|Australia]] at the Federal level, and also at the State level, the term \"Ministry\" refers to the ministerial office held by a member of Government, the executive, which is then responsible for one or more Departments, the top division of the public service. The collection of Departments responsible to a ministerial office and hence the Minister, is refered to as the Minister's \"portfolio\".\n\n[[New Zealand]]'s state agencies include many ministries and a smaller number of departments. Increasingly, state agencies are styled neither as ministries nor as departments. All New Zealand agencies are under the direction of one or more ministers or associate ministers, whether they are styled \"ministries\" or not. Each body also has an apolitical chief executive, and in ministries and departments these chief executives often have the title of Secretary.\n\nHowever, in other countries such as Luxembourg a department is a subdivision of a ministry, usually led by a government member called a secretary of state who is subordinate to the minister. \n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], the term \"bureau\" is used, and departments are subordinate to the bureaus, while in [[Mexico]], ministries are referred to as secretariats. \n\nIn [[Nigeria]] each ministry is led by a minister who is not a member of the [[National Assembly (Nigeria)|Nigerian legislature]] (due to the separation of powers) and is responsible to the popularly elected [[President of Nigeria|President]].\n\nIn [[Lebanon]], there are 21 ministries. Each ministry is led by a minister, and the Prime Minister is the 22nd minister of the Lebanese government.\n\nIn the [[European Union]], departments are termed [[Directorate-General|Directorate(s)-General]] with the civil servant in charge called a [[Director-General]] (in the [[European Commission]], the political head of the department is one of the [[European Commissioner]]s). \n\nThe [[Government of the Soviet Union|government departments of the Soviet Union]] were named \"People's Commissariats\" between 1917 and 1946.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe term \"ministry\" has also been widely used in fiction, notably in satires and parodies.\n\n===Books and films===\n* In the [[Harry Potter]] books the [[Ministry of Magic]] is the governing body of the magical community within the United Kingdom (not a department of the British Government responsible for magical affairs).\n* In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' there are four ministries in charge of Airstrip One (the former United Kingdom): the [[Ministry of Truth]] (education, culture and propaganda), the [[Ministry of Love]] (the interior), the [[Ministry of Plenty]] (economic affairs) and the [[Ministry of Peace]] (war and foreign affairs) .\n* The [[Ministry of Information Retrieval]] features in the film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''.\n* The Ministry of Social Coherence appears in an Estonian comedy ''Riigimehed'' (Statesmen).\n\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Yes Minister]]'' the Department of Administrative Affairs (DAA) is responsible for the administration of other government departments and the British Civil Service.

There are additional [[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|rabbinic prohibitions]] against eating these grains in any form other than [[matzo]].\n\nAmong Orthodox Ashkenazi and some Sephardic Jews, the custom (''[[minhag]]'') during Passover is to refrain from not only products of the five grains but also other grains and legumes. Traditions of what is considered kitniyot vary from community to community but generally include [[maize]] (American corn), as well as [[rice]], [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and [[bean]]s.

By this logic, it might be permitted to eat fresh kitniyot (like whole beans), or processed kitniyot which never came in contact with water (like certain squeezed oils or toasted solids). In fact, Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] states that Ashkenazim in Israel would eat fresh kitniyot on Pesach until the 1700s, when new Ashkenazi immigrants (the students of the Vilna Gaon and Baal Shem Tov) brought with them the custom not to eat fresh kitniyot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3382886,00.html|title=Revolutionary ruling: 'Yes' to kitniyot on Pesach|date=March 30, 2007|website=Ynetnews}}</ref> Conservative rabbis have ruled to permit fresh kitniyot.<ref>\"A Teshuvah Permitting Ashkenazim to Eat Kitniyot on Pesah\", Amy Levin and Avram Israel Reisner, [https://www.sefaria.org.il/sheets/30492 source]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Halakha|Halakhic]] argument (the argument according to Jewish law and tradition) against eating kitniyot during Passover originated in [[early medieval]] France and Provence and later flourished in [[high medieval]] [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] ([[Rhineland massacres|Rhineland]]) Germany.\n\nThe original reasons behind the custom of not eating kitniyot during Passover are not clear, though two common theories are that these items are often made into products resembling [[chametz]] (e.g. cornbread), or that these items were normally stored in the same sacks as the five grains and people worried that they might become contaminated with chametz. It is also possible that [[crop rotation]] would result in the forbidden chametz grains growing in the same fields, and being mixed in with the kitniyot. Those authorities concerned with these three issues suggested that by avoiding eating kitniyot, people would be better able to avoid chametz. Since Jewish law is quite stringent about the prohibition against chametz in the house during Passover, even in small amounts, a tradition developed to avoid these products altogether.<ref name=oukosher />\n\n[[Vilna Gaon]] (Hagaos HaGra, ibid.) proposes a different source for this custom. The [[Gemara]] in [[Pesahim|Pesachim]] (40b) notes that [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] objected to the workers of the [[Exilarch]] cooking a food called ''chasisi'' on Pesach, since it could to be confused with chametz. [[Tosafot]] understand that ''chasisi'' are lentils, and thus, argues Vilna Gaon, establishes the basis for the concern for kitniyot. Rabbi [[David Golinkin]] in the [[Conservative responsa|Responsa of the Masorati (Conservative) Movement]] cites Rabbenu Manoah (Provence, ca. 1265) who wrote an opinion in his commentary on Maimonides (Laws of Festivals and Holidays 5:1) that \"It is not proper to eat kitniyot on holidays because it is written<ref>(in {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:14|JPR}}</ref> that \u2018you shall rejoice in your festivals\u2019 and there is no joy in eating dishes made from kitniyot\". Lentils were a food of mourners.\n\nEven where the prohibition against kitniyot was practiced, some [[posek|poskim]] opposed it, among them Rabbi Yeruham of 14th century Provence.<ref name=\"Golinkin page 10\">Golinkin, \"The Kitniyot Dilemma,  Kolot  Vol 6, No. 3, page 10, Spring 2013</ref><ref name=Golinkin /> Others, including Rav Moshe Feinstein did not advocate abandoning the custom, but he opposed expanding the list of forbidden kitniyot <ref>[[Igrot Moshe]], [[Orah Hayyim]] 3. 63</ref>\n\n==Modern  Judaism and kitniyot==\nReform Jewish authorities, such as the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis|Responsa Committee of the Reform Jewish Movement]] for the principal organization of Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada, have also ruled in favor of permitting kitniyot.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eric|last=Berk|title=Food Restrictions on Passover Explained|work=Reform

Traditions of what is considered kitniyot vary from community to community but generally include [[maize]] (American corn), as well as [[rice]], [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and [[bean]]s.

By this logic, it might be permitted to eat fresh kitniyot (like whole beans), or processed kitniyot which never came in contact with water (like certain squeezed oils or toasted solids). In fact, Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] states that Ashkenazim in Israel would eat fresh kitniyot on Pesach until the 1700s, when new Ashkenazi immigrants (the students of the Vilna Gaon and Baal Shem Tov) brought with them the custom not to eat fresh kitniyot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3382886,00.html|title=Revolutionary ruling: 'Yes' to kitniyot on Pesach|date=March 30, 2007|website=Ynetnews}}</ref> Conservative rabbis have ruled to permit fresh kitniyot.<ref>\"A Teshuvah Permitting Ashkenazim to Eat Kitniyot on Pesah\", Amy Levin and Avram Israel Reisner, [https://www.sefaria.org.il/sheets/30492 source]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Halakha|Halakhic]] argument (the argument according to Jewish law and tradition) against eating kitniyot during Passover originated in [[early medieval]] France and Provence and later flourished in [[high medieval]] [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] ([[Rhineland massacres|Rhineland]]) Germany.\n\nThe original reasons behind the custom of not eating kitniyot during Passover are not clear, though two common theories are that these items are often made into products resembling [[chametz]] (e.g. cornbread), or that these items were normally stored in the same sacks as the five grains and people worried that they might become contaminated with chametz. It is also possible that [[crop rotation]] would result in the forbidden chametz grains growing in the same fields, and being mixed in with the kitniyot. Those authorities concerned with these three issues suggested that by avoiding eating kitniyot, people would be better able to avoid chametz. Since Jewish law is quite stringent about the prohibition against chametz in the house during Passover, even in small amounts, a tradition developed to avoid these products altogether.<ref name=oukosher />\n\n[[Vilna Gaon]] (Hagaos HaGra, ibid.) proposes a different source for this custom. The [[Gemara]] in [[Pesahim|Pesachim]] (40b) notes that [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] objected to the workers of the [[Exilarch]] cooking a food called ''chasisi'' on Pesach, since it could to be confused with chametz. [[Tosafot]] understand that ''chasisi'' are lentils, and thus, argues Vilna Gaon, establishes the basis for the concern for kitniyot. Rabbi [[David Golinkin]] in the [[Conservative responsa|Responsa of the Masorati (Conservative) Movement]] cites Rabbenu Manoah (Provence, ca. 1265) who wrote an opinion in his commentary on Maimonides (Laws of Festivals and Holidays 5:1) that \"It is not proper to eat kitniyot on holidays because it is written<ref>(in {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:14|JPR}}</ref> that \u2018you shall rejoice in your festivals\u2019 and there is no joy in eating dishes made from kitniyot\". Lentils were a food of mourners.\n\nEven where the prohibition against kitniyot was practiced, some [[posek|poskim]] opposed it, among them Rabbi Yeruham of 14th century Provence.<ref name=\"Golinkin page 10\">Golinkin, \"The Kitniyot Dilemma,  Kolot  Vol 6, No. 3, page 10, Spring 2013</ref><ref name=Golinkin /> Others, including Rav Moshe Feinstein did not advocate abandoning the custom, but he opposed expanding the list of forbidden kitniyot <ref>[[Igrot Moshe]], [[Orah Hayyim]] 3. 63</ref>\n\n==Modern  Judaism and kitniyot==\nReform Jewish authorities, such as the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis|Responsa Committee of the Reform Jewish Movement]] for the principal organization of Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada, have also ruled in favor of permitting kitniyot.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eric|last=Berk|title=Food Restrictions on Passover Explained|work=Reform

The primary election is scheduled for Tuesday, March 3, 2020, and the general election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020. Five of the nine council seats will be contested. No council incumbents are standing for reelection.\n\nMunicipal elections in [[California]] are officially non-partisan, although most members do identify a party preference.

The bridge was designed by [[David Lennox]] and built from 1832 to 1833 by James Randall and other [[convict]]s. It is also known as '''Lennox Bridge''' or '''The Horseshoe Bridge'''. The property is owned by Blue Mountains City Council. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-24>{{cite NSW SHR|5045255|Lennox Bridge|hr=00024|fn=S90/07399 & HC 30149|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref> The stone [[arch bridge]] is a single arch of {{convert|6|m}} span and is {{convert|9|m}} above water level, with a road width of {{convert|9|m}}.<ref name=ADoB_David_Lennox/>\n\n== History ==\nThe first road up the eastern slopes of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], built by [[William Cox]] (1814-15), was in [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie|Macquarie]]'s words \"pretty steep and sharp\" and was found to be subject to serious washways. This road was superseded in 1824 by what was known as the Bathurst Road (now Old Bathurst Road). It avoided watercourses, but its grade was very steep and this rendered it hazardous to travellers. When [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] was appointed as [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. Mitchell surveyed and recommended the construction of a road along this route midway between the other two in preference to the Governor's suggestion of stationing a permanent repair gang on the Old Bathurst Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |title=Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone |work=Australia For Everyone |publisher= |date=2019 |access-date=3 April 2020 }}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|'Mr David Lennox, who left his stone wall at my request, and with his sleeves still tucked up, came with me to my office, and undertook to plan the stone bridges required, make the centring arches and to carry on such works by directing and instructing the common labourers then at the disposal of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].'|[[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]], Letter to Perry, 22 March 1833.<ref name=nswshr-24-244>{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mitchell (explorer) |title=Letter to Perry |date=22 March 1833 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>}}\n\nAnd on 1 October 1832, only seven weeks after his arrival in the colony, Lennox was appointed (subject to London's confirmation) Sub-Inspector of Bridges in New South Wales. His first task was to plan and organise the spanning of [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] Creek on Mitchell's Pass. By early November 1832, he and his selected twenty convicts; with suitable experience had opened a quarry near the creek, had cut a number of stone blocks and were ready to start building operations. The design called for a horseshoe shape to give optimum strength.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nBy March 1833, the experimental bridge was so far advanced that Mitchell had to decide what should be carved on the keystones. He agreed that on the upstream side (the south side), the inscription should commemorate the man he had chosen so percipiently, so the masons carved \"DAVID LENNOX\", while on the north side they carved \"AD 1833\". There has been weathering on the south side but the AD1833 stone is still in very good condition.<ref name=nswshr-24-245>{{cite journal |title=Selkirk |journal=Journal of Royal Australian Historical Society |issn= |volume=6 |year=1920 |pages=202-207 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nLennox Bridge, opened in 1833, is the oldest surviving stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland.<ref>[http://www.glenbrookchamber.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54:glenbrook-parks-a-reserves-an-historical-perspective&catid=43:glenbrook Glenbrook Chamber]</ref><ref name=\"engheritage-sydney.org.au\">http://www.engheritage-sydney.org.au/PDFs/Mitchell's.pdf</ref> It crosses Brookside Creek (also known as Lapstone Creek) on the road known as Mitchell's Pass.

A nearby quarry is thought to have been created for the purpose of providing stone for the bridge.<ref name=BMCC_Report/>\n\nA small crack appeared beside the arch but Lennox advised against taking any remedial action. The bridge remained very robust and carried increasingly heavy traffic as the Great Road to the west became busier. The success of the railway after 1867 diverted much transport business away from the road until the twentieth century and advent of the motor vehicle. Mitchell's Pass began to bear more traffic than was comfortable for Lenox Bridge, although the conversion of [[Knapsack Viaduct]] from a trail line to a road bridge in 1926 opened a new road route up the Monocline and at last diverted much of the traffic from Mitchell's Pass.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nMitchell's Pass continued to be used, however, and by 1975 it was plain that substantial works were necessary to secure the safety of Lennox Bridge. Restoration works took place in 1976.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge served the main route to the Blue Mountains for 93 years until 1926, when the [[Great Western Highway]] was re-routed via the Knapsack Viaduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infobluemountains.net.au/history/lennox.htm|title=Lennox Bridge, Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone Hill|work=Blue Mountains, Australia, History|publisher=David Martin|year=2003|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> It was closed in 1967 but later strengthened and repaired with an internal concrete structure and it re-opened in 1982.<ref name=BMCC_Report/><ref name=\"engheritage-sydney.org.au\"/>\n\n== Description ==\nLennox Bridge [[Span (architecture)|spans]] the deep gully of Lapstone Creek at the head of the steepest part of Mitchell's Pass. The [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] are on bedrock, with the water running through a channel cut by Lennox's convicts in the bed of the creek. The bridge is quite small, with a span of only {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The single arch is built of [[ashlar]]ed stone blocks mortared together. The arch on the south side has a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] bearing the inscription \"DAVID LENNOX\", on the north side, \"AD 1833\", the packing of the bridge to either hand of the main ashlared section is of coursed rubble [[revetment]]s, making the total length of the bridge carriageway of almost {{convert|47|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The stone [[parapet]]s are laid above a projecting [[plinth]] which begins just above the keystones. The area between the curve of the arch and the horizontal carriageway was packed with small rubble stone.<ref name=CMP/>\n\nThere was originally a damp-proof lime-mortar course above the vaulting, but this, together with most of the packing, was removed when the bridge was stripped back to the arch in 1976. During these repairs new concrete supports were inserted to bear the weight of a new carriageway utilising steel girders to take the traffic then still using Mitchell's Pass. These changes arc not visible, but the insertion of new blocks of stone and repairs to existing blocks on the main arch are legible. The original stone-cut channel for the creek still exists but is obscured by a concrete channel poured within Lennox's work during the 1976 repairs. Since Mitchell's Pass ceased to take the heavy traffic over the Blue Mountains, via the former Knapsack Railway Viaduct, the road is now one-way only downhill from Lennox Bridge and the traffic is largely for tourist purposes. There is a small amount of car-parking space beside the bridge and a concrete stairwell and path down to the creek on the west side. The visitor can safely walk under the bridge obtain the most attractive views.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 28 November 2013, the physical condition was good.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge retains a high degree of original fabric. 1976 restorations do not detract from the significance of the built heritage item.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe road was closed, the carriageway removed and the bridge stripped down to its bare stone arch in 1976. The Department of Main Roads decided that the stress had to be removed from the original arch and reconstructed the carriageway so that it was supported on two new concrete walls and borne on horizontal steel girders. With other repairs to the stonework and to the channel for the creek under the bridge, the road was reopened in 1976 with the new work largely concealed from view. With much reduced traffic flow and the road to the plains from the bridge made one-way only (downhill), the Lennox Bridge continues to serve as the oldest stone bridge on the Australian Mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24-246>Kullas, LGEA of NSW Journal, July 1983, 85- 86</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 28 November 2013, Lennox Bridge was the oldest stone bridge on the Australian mainland.

At forty-five years of age Lennox began service under Major Mitchell. Prior to arriving in the Colony he had spent seventeen years on public works executed at the expense of the British Government. During this time he constructed a number of wooden bridges associated with the Gloucester-Berkeley Canal and a stone bridge near [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]]. In 1832, two years after the death of his wife, Lennox arrived on the Colony on the ''[[Florentia (1821 ship)|Florentia]]''. Not long after his arrival, he was discovered by Major Mitchell. On 1 October 1832, following the review of his credentials, Lennox was appointed to the Roads Department as the Sub-Inspector of Bridges. Within six weeks of his appointment Lennox and his men had cut most of the stone and procured lime for mortar. By July 1833, the bridge was complete. The success of Lennox's design is demonstrated through its on-going stability and continued use. Major restoration and safety improvement work was not required until the 1950s.\n\nLennox Bridge is also associated with at least twenty convicts, an overseer, a constable and an armed sentry that worked on the site between October 1832 and July 1833, the construction gang worked from 7am to 4pm, when they returned to their stockade at [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]]. The work involved stone cutting and setting, carpentry and masonry required to construct the bridge. Following completion of the bridge Lennox requested to retain the: services of eight convicts: William Brady, John Carsons, Robert Hyams, John Johnson, Patrick Malowney (Maloney), Thomas Nelson, James Randall and Daniel Williams. The sentences of six of the eight convicts were remitted. The remaining two were reduced after a further six months of work.<ref name=nswshr-24-247>Low, 1983, p12</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe original bridge, on a horse-shoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive, The stonework has been restored some infelicities have been allowed on the revetment and the changes made in 1976 by introducing concrete to the stone-cut water channel beneath the bridge are unpleasing but David Lennox's concept for the bridge of a very pretty small gorge remains aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge was carried on a single semi-circular stone arch of ten feet radius. The roadway was thirty feet wide at the crown of the arch and the same height above the bed or the gully. After bearing over one hundred and seventy years of traffic and one major restoration still stands stable. The bridge is a very fine example of the work of David Lennox and represents the first scientifically constructed stone arched bridge of its magnitude In Australia.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is exceptionally rare.

The bridge was designed by [[David Lennox]] and built from 1832 to 1833 by James Randall and other [[convict]]s. It is also known as '''Lennox Bridge''' or '''The Horseshoe Bridge'''. The property is owned by Blue Mountains City Council. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-24>{{cite NSW SHR|5045255|Lennox Bridge|hr=00024|fn=S90/07399 & HC 30149|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref> The stone [[arch bridge]] is a single arch of {{convert|6|m}} span and is {{convert|9|m}} above water level, with a road width of {{convert|9|m}}.<ref name=ADoB_David_Lennox/>\n\n== History ==\nThe first road up the eastern slopes of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], built by [[William Cox]] (1814-15), was in [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie|Macquarie]]'s words \"pretty steep and sharp\" and was found to be subject to serious washways. This road was superseded in 1824 by what was known as the Bathurst Road (now Old Bathurst Road). It avoided watercourses, but its grade was very steep and this rendered it hazardous to travellers. When [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] was appointed as [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. Mitchell surveyed and recommended the construction of a road along this route midway between the other two in preference to the Governor's suggestion of stationing a permanent repair gang on the Old Bathurst Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |title=Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone |work=Australia For Everyone |publisher= |date=2019 |access-date=3 April 2020 }}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|'Mr David Lennox, who left his stone wall at my request, and with his sleeves still tucked up, came with me to my office, and undertook to plan the stone bridges required, make the centring arches and to carry on such works by directing and instructing the common labourers then at the disposal of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].'|[[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]], Letter to Perry, 22 March 1833.<ref name=nswshr-24-244>{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mitchell (explorer) |title=Letter to Perry |date=22 March 1833 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>}}\n\nAnd on 1 October 1832, only seven weeks after his arrival in the colony, Lennox was appointed (subject to London's confirmation) Sub-Inspector of Bridges in New South Wales. His first task was to plan and organise the spanning of [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] Creek on Mitchell's Pass. By early November 1832, he and his selected twenty convicts; with suitable experience had opened a quarry near the creek, had cut a number of stone blocks and were ready to start building operations. The design called for a horseshoe shape to give optimum strength.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nBy March 1833, the experimental bridge was so far advanced that Mitchell had to decide what should be carved on the keystones. He agreed that on the upstream side (the south side), the inscription should commemorate the man he had chosen so percipiently, so the masons carved \"DAVID LENNOX\", while on the north side they carved \"AD 1833\". There has been weathering on the south side but the AD1833 stone is still in very good condition.<ref name=nswshr-24-245>{{cite journal |title=Selkirk |journal=Journal of Royal Australian Historical Society |issn= |volume=6 |year=1920 |pages=202-207 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nLennox Bridge, opened in 1833, is the oldest surviving stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland.<ref>[http://www.glenbrookchamber.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54:glenbrook-parks-a-reserves-an-historical-perspective&catid=43:glenbrook Glenbrook Chamber]</ref><ref name=\"engheritage-sydney.org.au\">http://www.engheritage-sydney.org.au/PDFs/Mitchell's.pdf</ref> It crosses Brookside Creek (also known as Lapstone Creek) on the road known as Mitchell's Pass.

A nearby quarry is thought to have been created for the purpose of providing stone for the bridge.<ref name=BMCC_Report/>\n\nA small crack appeared beside the arch but Lennox advised against taking any remedial action. The bridge remained very robust and carried increasingly heavy traffic as the Great Road to the west became busier. The success of the railway after 1867 diverted much transport business away from the road until the twentieth century and advent of the motor vehicle. Mitchell's Pass began to bear more traffic than was comfortable for Lenox Bridge, although the conversion of [[Knapsack Viaduct]] from a trail line to a road bridge in 1926 opened a new road route up the Monocline and at last diverted much of the traffic from Mitchell's Pass.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nMitchell's Pass continued to be used, however, and by 1975 it was plain that substantial works were necessary to secure the safety of Lennox Bridge. Restoration works took place in 1976.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge served the main route to the Blue Mountains for 93 years until 1926, when the [[Great Western Highway]] was re-routed via the Knapsack Viaduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infobluemountains.net.au/history/lennox.htm|title=Lennox Bridge, Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone Hill|work=Blue Mountains, Australia, History|publisher=David Martin|year=2003|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> It was closed in 1967 but later strengthened and repaired with an internal concrete structure and it re-opened in 1982.<ref name=BMCC_Report/><ref name=\"engheritage-sydney.org.au\"/>\n\n== Description ==\nLennox Bridge [[Span (architecture)|spans]] the deep gully of Lapstone Creek at the head of the steepest part of Mitchell's Pass. The [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] are on bedrock, with the water running through a channel cut by Lennox's convicts in the bed of the creek. The bridge is quite small, with a span of only {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The single arch is built of [[ashlar]]ed stone blocks mortared together. The arch on the south side has a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] bearing the inscription \"DAVID LENNOX\", on the north side, \"AD 1833\", the packing of the bridge to either hand of the main ashlared section is of coursed rubble [[revetment]]s, making the total length of the bridge carriageway of almost {{convert|47|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The stone [[parapet]]s are laid above a projecting [[plinth]] which begins just above the keystones. The area between the curve of the arch and the horizontal carriageway was packed with small rubble stone.<ref name=CMP/>\n\nThere was originally a damp-proof lime-mortar course above the vaulting, but this, together with most of the packing, was removed when the bridge was stripped back to the arch in 1976. During these repairs new concrete supports were inserted to bear the weight of a new carriageway utilising steel girders to take the traffic then still using Mitchell's Pass. These changes arc not visible, but the insertion of new blocks of stone and repairs to existing blocks on the main arch are legible. The original stone-cut channel for the creek still exists but is obscured by a concrete channel poured within Lennox's work during the 1976 repairs. Since Mitchell's Pass ceased to take the heavy traffic over the Blue Mountains, via the former Knapsack Railway Viaduct, the road is now one-way only downhill from Lennox Bridge and the traffic is largely for tourist purposes. There is a small amount of car-parking space beside the bridge and a concrete stairwell and path down to the creek on the west side. The visitor can safely walk under the bridge obtain the most attractive views.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 28 November 2013, the physical condition was good.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge retains a high degree of original fabric. 1976 restorations do not detract from the significance of the built heritage item.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe road was closed, the carriageway removed and the bridge stripped down to its bare stone arch in 1976. The Department of Main Roads decided that the stress had to be removed from the original arch and reconstructed the carriageway so that it was supported on two new concrete walls and borne on horizontal steel girders. With other repairs to the stonework and to the channel for the creek under the bridge, the road was reopened in 1976 with the new work largely concealed from view. With much reduced traffic flow and the road to the plains from the bridge made on-way only (downhill) Lennox Bridge continues to serve as the oldest stone bridge on the Australian Mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24-246>Kullas, LGEA of NSW Journal, July 1983, 85- 86</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 28 November 2013, Lennox Bridge was the oldest stone bridge on the Australian mainland.

At forty-five years of age Lennox began service under Major Mitchell. Prior to arriving in the Colony he had spent seventeen years on public works executed at the expense of the British Government. During this time he constructed a number of wooden bridges associated with the Gloucester-Berkeley Canal and a stone bridge near [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]]. In 1832, two years after the death of his wife, Lennox arrived on the Colony on the ''[[Florentia (1821 ship)|Florentia]]''. Not long after his arrival, he was discovered by Major Mitchell. On 1 October 1832, following the review of his credentials, Lennox was appointed to the Roads Department as the Sub-Inspector of Bridges. Within six weeks of his appointment Lennox and his men had cut most of the stone and procured lime for mortar. By July 1833, the bridge was complete. The success of Lennox's design is demonstrated through its on-going stability and continued use. Major restoration and safety improvement work was not required until the 1950s.\n\nLennox Bridge is also associated with at least twenty convicts, an overseer, a constable and an armed sentry that worked on the site between October 1832 and July 1833, the construction gang worked from 7am to 4pm, when they returned to their stockade at [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]]. The work involved stone cutting and setting, carpentry and masonry required to construct the bridge. Following completion of the bridge Lennox requested to retain the: services of eight convicts: William Brady, John Carsons, Robert Hyams, John Johnson, Patrick Malowney (Maloney), Thomas Nelson, James Randall and Daniel Williams. The sentences of six of the eight convicts were remitted. The remaining two were reduced after a further six months of work.<ref name=nswshr-24-247>Low, 1983, p12</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe original bridge, on a horse-shoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive, The stonework has been restored some infelicities have been allowed on the revetment and the changes made in 1976 by introducing concrete to the stone-cut water channel beneath the bridge are unpleasing but David Lennox's concept for the bridge of a very pretty small gorge remains aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge was carried on a single semi-circular stone arch of ten feet radius. The roadway was thirty feet wide at the crown of the arch and the same height above the bed or the gully. After bearing over one hundred and seventy years of traffic and one major restoration still stands stable. The bridge is a very fine example of the work of David Lennox and represents the first scientifically constructed stone arched bridge of its magnitude In Australia.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is exceptionally rare.
