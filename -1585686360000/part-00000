Anne-Mary is petulant and domineering; Verner is quiet and philosophical. She is finalising arrangements for a grand dinner party she is to give in the hotel's restaurant that evening with a prince as guest of honour. Maud Caragnani, the English widow of an Italian prince, pays them a visit. The three met for the first time in Rome quite recently. Verner took to her; Anne-Mary did not. When one of the dinner guests rings to cancel because of illness, Anne-Mary is horrified: there would be thirteen at the table. She tells Vernon he will have to eat his dinner in the suite rather than in the restaurant. He is not excessively distressed.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 517\u2013518</ref>\n\n===Scene 2===\nThat evening Verner is relaxing after dining in the suite. He asks the waiter, Felix, about Maud. Felix tells him that she is \"an enchanting lady of whom everyone is fond\". After Felix has gone, the telephone rings. Maud, from the hotel lobby, asks if she may come up. When she arrives she and Verner have a friendly conversation, and it becomes clear that they are strongly drawn to each other. When Maud suggests they might meet later in Rome, Verner tells her \"I am coming with you this very night\". He convinces her that he is in earnest and means to marry her. She insists that they must both be free to see how things turn out. She leaves, with a promise to pick him up at 12.30 in her car. Anne-Mary returns in a bad temper from the dinner party, which has not gone as well as she hoped. Verner pretends to be asleep, but she insists on waking him to complain about her guests. To annoy her, Verner pretends to be drunk. She demands that he leave her alone. As he goes out, Verner replies, \"Okay, that's exactly what I intend to do. Goodnight, sweetheart!\"<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 518\u2013519</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nCoward wrote in his diary, \"''Maud'' was an absolute riot from beginning to end, and the ovation at the final curtain was quite, quite wonderful.\" ''[[The Times]]'' said, \"Situation and characters alike are good solid stereotypes, but they still have plenty of life in them\".<ref>\"Noel Coward's Variations on Middle Age\", ''The Times'', 26 April 1966, p. 16</ref> In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Philip Hope-Wallace]] thought the play \"a loud and impenitent comedy \u2026 a lot of fun\".<ref>\"Noel Coward Double Bill\", ''The Guardian'', 26 April 1966, p. 7</ref> The London correspondent of the New York ''Sunday News'' thought Coward \"witty, amusing and brilliant\".<ref>Cameron, Kate. \"This week's Openings\", ''Sunday News'', 7 August 1966, p. S7</ref> ''[[The Observer]]'' commented that the play and its two companions represented Coward's best writing since the Second World War; Coward's message was that love, courage and consideration can prevent other people from being Hell.<ref>Bryden, Ronald. \"Theatre\", ''The Observer'', 1 May 1966, p. 24</ref> In ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', Jeremy Kingston thought the double bill of poorer quality than ''A Song a Twilight'', but \"the jokes are frequent and the end is skilfully worked out\".<ref>Kingston, Jeremy. \"Theatre\", ''Punch'', 4 May 1966, p. 663</ref>\n\nWhen the play opened on Broadway, the ''Daily News'' thought it \"so old-fashioned it might have been written 40 years ago \u2013 but it plays\".<ref>Watt, Douglas. \"Noel Coward in Two Keys\", ''Daily News'', 1 March 1974, p. 61</ref> In ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', Dan Sullivan called for \"pink champagne. \u2026 There is nothing major about this show. \u2026 It will not change anybody's life.

Anne-Mary is petulant and domineering; Verner is quiet and philosophical. She is finalising arrangements for a grand dinner party she is to give in the hotel's restaurant that evening with a prince as guest of honour. Maud Caragnani, the English widow of an Italian prince, pays them a visit. The three met for the first time in Rome quite recently. Verner took to her; Anne-Mary did not. When one of the dinner guests rings to cancel because of illness, Anne-Mary is horrified: there would be thirteen at the table. She tells Vernon he will have to eat his dinner in the suite rather than in the restaurant. He is not excessively distressed.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 517\u2013518</ref>\n\n===Scene 2===\nThat evening Verner is relaxing after dining in the suite. He asks the waiter, Felix, about Maud. Felix tells him that she is \"an enchanting lady of whom everyone is fond\". After Felix has gone, the telephone rings. Maud, from the hotel lobby, asks if she may come up. When she arrives she and Verner have a friendly conversation, and it becomes clear that they are strongly drawn to each other. When Maud suggests they might meet later in Rome, Verner tells her \"I am coming with you this very night\". He convinces her that he is in earnest and means to marry her. She insists that they must both be free to see how things turn out. She leaves, with a promise to pick him up at 12.30 in her car. Anne-Mary returns in a bad temper from the dinner party, which has not gone as well as she hoped. Verner pretends to be asleep, but she insists on waking him to complain about her guests. To annoy her, Verner pretends to be drunk. She demands that he leave her alone. As he goes out, Verner replies, \"Okay, that's exactly what I intend to do. Goodnight, sweetheart!\"<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 518\u2013519</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nCoward wrote in his diary, \"''Maud'' was an absolute riot from beginning to end, and the ovation at the final curtain was quite, quite wonderful.\" ''[[The Times]]'' said, \"Situation and characters alike are good solid stereotypes, but they still have plenty of life in them\".<ref>\"Noel Coward's Variations on Middle Age\", ''The Times'', 26 April 1966, p. 16</ref> In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Philip Hope-Wallace]] thought the play \"a loud and impenitent comedy \u2026 a lot of fun\".<ref>\"Noel Coward Double Bill\", ''The Guardian'', 26 April 1966, p. 7</ref> The London correspondent of the New York ''Sunday News'' thought Coward \"witty, amusing and brilliant\".<ref>Cameron, Kate. \"This week's Openings\", ''Sunday News'', 7 August 1966, p.

The league expanded as the [[Barrie Colts]] entered into the central division. The [[Detroit Junior Red Wings]] become the [[Detroit Whalers]]. Seventeen teams each played 66 games. The [[Peterborough Petes]] won the [[J.

The Whalers would play 21 of their 33 home games in the regular season at the [[Palace of Auburn Hills]] while playing their remaining 12 home games at [[Oak Park Ice Arena]].

Around 20 riders fell blocking the entire road and leaving approximately 30 riders to sprint for the victory, eventually taken by Steegmans in his home country ahead of his compatriot and teammate [[Tom Boonen]], who took over the green jersey by coming second in the stage.\n\nOn 6 July 2008, it was announced Steegmans signed a two-year contract with {{ct|TCS|2008}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/gert-steegmans-to-ditch-quickstep-for-tinkoff-17367 |title=AFP: Gert Steegmans to ditch Quick.Step for Tinkoff |access-date=7 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124223104/http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/gert-steegmans-to-ditch-quickstep-for-tinkoff-17367/ |archive-date=24 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the [[2008 Tour de France|Tour de France]], he won the prestigious stage at [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in Tour de France|Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. Team Tinkoff later folded under that name, and the management and ridership re-emerged as {{ct|KAT|2009}}.\n\nSteegmans made headlines in the weeks leading up to the [[2009 Tour de France]] with his refusal to sign an anti-doping agreement which Team Katusha was trying to get all its riders to sign. The agreement called for any rider who tested positive for a doping substance to pay a fine of five times their annual salary. Steegmans persisted in his refusal even after an ultimatum handed down by the team, which resulted in his not being selected for Katusha's Tour de France squad.<ref>{{cite web | title=Steegmans won't

He was noted for a strong finishing sprint and could compete in the sprint with fellow Belgian cyclist, and teammate, [[Tom Boonen]].\n\n==Career overview==\nAlthough Steegmans was already known in Belgium, he gained more popularity outside Belgium as he piloted [[Robbie McEwen]] to two stage wins during the [[2006 Tour de France]].\n\nDuring the second stage of the [[2007 Tour de France]], a Liquigas rider fell sideways in the last 3 kilometres causing others to fall. Around 20 riders fell blocking the entire road and leaving approximately 30 riders to sprint for the victory, eventually taken by Steegmans in his home country ahead of his compatriot and teammate [[Tom Boonen]], who took over the green jersey by coming second in the stage.\n\nOn 6 July 2008, it was announced Steegmans signed a two-year contract with {{ct|TCS|2008}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/gert-steegmans-to-ditch-quickstep-for-tinkoff-17367 |title=AFP: Gert Steegmans to ditch Quick.Step for Tinkoff |access-date=7 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124223104/http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/gert-steegmans-to-ditch-quickstep-for-tinkoff-17367/ |archive-date=24 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the [[2008 Tour de France|Tour de France]], he won the prestigious stage at [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in Tour de France|Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. Team Tinkoff later folded under that name, and the management and ridership re-emerged as {{ct|KAT|2009}}.\n\nSteegmans made headlines in the weeks leading up to the [[2009 Tour de France]] with his refusal to sign an anti-doping agreement which Team Katusha was trying to get all its riders to sign. The agreement called for any rider who tested positive for a doping substance to pay a fine of five times their annual salary. Steegmans persisted in his refusal even after an ultimatum handed down by the team, which resulted in his not being selected for Katusha's Tour de France squad.<ref>{{cite web | title=Steegmans won't
