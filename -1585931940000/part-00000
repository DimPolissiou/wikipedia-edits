{"title_page": "Tap water", "text_new": "{{RefImprove|date=May 2018}}[[Image:Wasserhahn.jpg|thumb|A simple indoor water tap]]\n\n'''Tap water''' (''running water'', ''city water'', ''town water'', ''municipal water'', ''sink water'', etc.) is [[water]] supplied to a [[tap (valve)]]. Its uses include drinking, washing, cooking, and the flushing of [[toilet]]s. Indoor tap water is distributed through \"indoor [[plumbing]]\", which has existed since antiquity but was available to very few people until the second half of the 19th century when it began to spread in popularity in what are now [[developed country|developed countries]]. Tap water became common in many regions during the 20th century, and is now lacking mainly among people in poverty, especially in [[developing country|developing countries]].\n\nTap water is often culturally assumed to be [[drinking water]], especially in developed countries. Usually it is potable, although [[water quality]] problems are not rare. Household [[water purification]] methods such as [[water filter]]s, [[boiling]], or [[distillation]] can be used when tap water's potability is doubted. The application of technologies (such as [[water treatment]] plants) involved in providing clean water to homes, businesses, and public buildings is a major subfield of [[sanitary engineering]]. Calling a water supply \"tap water\" distinguishes it from the other main types of fresh water which may be available; these include water from rainwater-collecting [[cistern]]s, water from [[village pump]]s or town pumps, water from [[Water well|well]]s, or water carried from streams, rivers, or lakes (whose potability may vary).\n\n==Background==\nPublicly available treated water has historically been associated with major increases in life expectancy and improved [[public health]].  [[Water-borne diseases]] are vastly reduced by proper sewage and fresh water availability. Providing tap water to large urban or suburban populations requires a complex and carefully designed system of collection, storage, [[water purification|treatment]] and distribution, and is commonly the responsibility of a government agency, often the same agency responsible for the removal and treatment of [[clean water]].\n\nSpecific [[compound (chemistry)|chemical compounds]] are often taken out of tap water during the treatment process to adjust the [[pH]] or remove contaminants, and [[chlorine]] may be added to kill [[biotoxin|biological toxins]]. Local geological conditions affecting [[groundwater]] are determining factors for the presence of various metal [[ion]]s, often rendering the water \"[[soft water|soft]]\" or \"[[hard water|hard]]\".\n\nTap water remains susceptible to biological or chemical contamination. In the event of contamination deemed dangerous to public health, government officials typically issue an advisory regarding water consumption. In the case of [[biological contamination]], residents are usually advised to boil their water before consumption or to use bottled water as an alternative. In the case of chemical contamination, residents may be advised to refrain from consuming tap water entirely until the matter is resolved.\n\nIn many areas a [[compound (chemistry)|compound]] of [[fluoride]] is added to tap water in an effort to improve [[dental health]] among the public. In some communities \"[[Water fluoridation|fluoridation]]\" remains a controversial issue. (See [[water fluoridation controversy]].)\n\n==Potable water supply==\n{{main|Potable water}}\nThis supply may come from several possible sources.\n* [[Water purification|Municipal water supply]]\n* [[Water well]]s\n* Processed water from creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, rainwater, etc.\n\nDomestic water systems have been evolving since people first located their homes near a running water supply, such as a stream or river.  The water flow also allowed sending waste water away from the residences.\n\nModern indoor plumbing delivers clean, safe, potable water to each service point in the distribution system.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  It is not important that the clean water not be contaminated by the waste water (disposal) side of the process system.

It is usually caused by air bubbles coming out of solution due to change in temperature or pressure. Because cold water holds more air than warm water, small bubbles will appear in water. It has a high dissolved gas content that is heated or depressurized, which reduces how much dissolved gas the water can hold. The harmless cloudiness of the water disappears quickly as the gas is released from the water.<ref>Massachusetts Water Resource Authority. http://www.mwra.com/04water/2004/whitewater.htm</ref>\n\n==Hot water supply==\n{{Main|Hot water system}}\nDomestic hot water is provided by means of [[water heating|water heater]] appliances, or through [[district heating]].

Babangida resigned due to the annulment of the [[1993 Nigerian presidential election]]. \n\nPrior to his political career, Shonekan was the chairman and chief executive of the [[United African Company of Nigeria PLC|United African Company of Nigeria]], a large Nigerian conglomerate, which at the time was the largest African-controlled company in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref>\"Stronger Moves Towards Manufacturing\", ''Financial Times'' (London, England), 3 March 1986</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nShonekan was born on 9 May 1936 in [[Lagos]]. The son of an [[Abeokuta]]-born civil servant, he was one of six children born into the family. \n\nShonekan was educated at [[CMS Grammar School, Lagos|C.M.S Grammar School]] and [[Igbobi College]]. He received a law degree from the [[University of London]], and was called to the bar. He later attended [[Harvard Business School]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1964, Shonekan joined the [[United Africa Company of Nigeria]]. He rose through the ranks in the company and was promoted to the position of assistant legal adviser. He later became a deputy adviser and joined the board. In 1980, he was made chairman and chief executive. Shonekan cultivated a wide array of business and political connections. \n\n==Head of Transitional Council==\nOn 2 January 1993, Shonekan assumed office as the head of transitional council and head of government under General Babangida. At the time, the transitional council was designed to be the final phase leading to a scheduled hand over to an elected democratic leader.\n\nShonekan learned of the dire condition of government finances, which he was unable to correct. The 1993 budget was pegged to include a 28 billion naira [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] with little money left in its [[foreign reserves]]. The government was hard pressed on [[debt]] obligations and had to hold constant talks for debt rescheduling. Babangida's [[Armed Forces Ruling Council]] had designed a realistic two-year economic program. The program's outline called for reducing the petrol subsidy, to bring in 65 billion [[naira]] to government coffers. A modification of [[VAT]] was also introduced and a plan to inculcate fiscal discipline. \n\nIn August 1993, Babangida resigned from office, following the annulment of the June 12 elections. He signed a decree establishing the [[Cabinet of Ernest Shonekan|Interim National Government]] led by Shonekan. Babangida made the interim government weak by placing it under the control of the military.\n\n==Presidency==\n\nShonekan assumed the office of [[President of Nigeria]] on 26 August 1993, with General Babangida's blessing. \n\n=== Economy ===\nShonekan had lobbied for [[debt relief|debt cancellation]] but, after the election annulment, most of the Western powers had imposed economic sanctions on Nigeria. Inflation was uncontrollable and most non-oil [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] disappeared. The government also initiated an audit of the accounts of [[NNPC]], the oil giant,<ref>\"Government Probes Oil Industry Corruption\", ''The Associated Press,'' 16 September 1993</ref> an organisation that had many operational inefficiencies.  \n\n=== Political crisis ===\nShonekan was unable to control the political crisis which ensued following the election annulment. During his few months in power, he tried to create a new timetable for democratic return, while his government was hampered by a national workers' [[Strike action|strike]]. Opposition leader [[Moshood Abiola]], viewed Shonekan's interim government as illegitimate. \n\n=== Democratisation ===\nShonekan released political prisoners detained by Babangida.

{"title_page": "Women in the Bible", "text_new": "{{short description|Women mentioned in the Bible}}\n{{see also|List of women in the Bible}}\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d. \u00c4. 014.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.6|''Eva'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1528)]]\n{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}\n{{Christianity and gender|theology}}\n\nThe '''women in the Bible''' are rarely mentioned by name, with named women representing only 5.5 to 8 percent of the total of all named characters, male and female.  This suggests that women were not usually in the forefront of public life. Those women that are named, rose to prominence for reasons outside the ordinary. They are often an aspect of the over-turning of man-made power structures commonly found in a biblical literary device called a \"reversal.\" [[Abigail]] and [[Esther]], [[Jael]] who drove a tent peg into the enemy commander's temple while he slept, are a few examples of women who turned the tables on men with power. The [[Matriarchs (Bible)|founding matriarchs]] are mentioned by name, as are some prophetesses, judges, heroines, and queens, while the common woman is largely, though not completely, unseen. The slave [[Hagar]]'s story is told, and the prostitute [[Rahab]]'s story is also told, along with a few others like them.\n\nAll [[Ancient Near East]]ern societies were [[patriarchal]], and the Bible is a patriarchal document, written by men from a patriarchal age.  Many scholars see the primary emphasis of the Bible as reinforcing women's subordinate status. However, there are also scholars who claim there is a kind of [[gender blindness]] in the Bible as well as patriarchy. Marital laws in the Bible favored men, as did inheritance laws. There were strict laws of sexual behavior with adultery a crime punishable by [[stoning]]. A woman in ancient biblical times was always under the authority of a man and was subject to strict purity laws, both ritual and moral. However, women such as [[Deborah]], the [[Woman of Shunem|Shunnemite woman]], and the prophetess [[Huldah]], rise above societal limitations in their stories. The Bible contains many noted narratives of women as both victors and victims, women who change the course of events, and women who are powerless and unable to affect their own destinies.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] refers to a number of women in [[Jesus]]\u2019 inner circle, and he is generally seen by scholars as dealing with women with respect. The New Testament names women in positions of leadership in the early church as well. There are controversies within the contemporary Christian church concerning women. For example, [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] as \"outstanding among the apostles\" and there is disagreement over whether Junia was a woman and an apostle, and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s role as a leader is also disputed. Sexuality has played a major role in these issues which have impacted, and continue to impact, how the modern Christian church sees the role of women. These changing views of women in the Bible are reflected in art and culture.\n\n==Women, sex, and law in surrounding cultures==\nAlmost all Near Eastern societies of the Bronze (3000-1200 BCE) and Axial Ages (800 to 300 BCE) were patriarchal with patriarchy established in most by 3000 BCE.<ref name=\"Henry Sumner Maine\">{{cite book |last1=Maine |first1=Henry Sumner |title=Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation With to Modern Ideas |date=2015|publisher=Palala Press|isbn= 978-1340712365|quote=Originally Published in 1874 by Henry Holt and Company, New York; Republished as Historically Significant.}}</ref>{{rp|xxxii}} Eastern societies such as the [[Akkadians]], [[Hittites]], [[Assyria]]ns and [[Persians]] relegated women to an inferior and subordinate position.

For example, a husband could divorce a wife if he chose to, but a wife could not divorce a husband without his consent. The law said a woman could not make a binding vow without consent of her male authority, so she could not legally marry without male approval.  The practice of [[levirate marriage]] applied to widows of childless deceased husbands, not to widowers of childless deceased wives; though, if either he or she didn't consent to the marriage, a different ceremony called ''[[chalitza]]'' was done instead; this involves the widow removing her brother-in-law's shoe, spitting in front of him, and proclaiming, \"This is what happens to someone who will not build his brother's house!\".<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|163}} Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. Women in biblical times depended on men economically. Women had the right to own property jointly with their husbands, except in the rare case of inheriting land from a father who didn't bear sons. Even \"in such cases, women would be required to remarry within the tribe so as not to reduce its land holdings.\"<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|171}} Property was transferred through the male line and women could not inherit unless there were no male heirs (Numbers 27:1-11; 36:1-12).<ref name = \"Davies1\"/>{{rp|3}} These and other gender-based differences found in the Torah suggest that women were seen as subordinate to men; however, they also suggest that biblical society viewed continuity, property, and family unity as paramount.<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\" />\n\nPhilosopher Michael Berger says, the rural family was the backbone of biblical society. Women did tasks as important as those of men, managed their households, and were equals in daily life, but all public decisions were made by men. Men had specific obligations they were required to perform for their wives including the provision of clothing, food, and sexual relations.<ref>[[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, Joseph]].

A large percentage of children died early, and those that survived, learned to share the burdens and responsibilities of family life as they grew.

In the Bible, for a woman or girl who was under the protection of a man to be called a \"''zonah''\" was a grave insult to her and her family. The ''zonah'' is shown as lacking protection, making each ''zonah'' vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren't.

Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, \u201cAfter I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?\u201d (Genesis 18:10-15). Sarah gives her slave Hagar to Abraham and he has sexual relations with her and she becomes pregnant. Sarah hopes to build a family through Hagar, but Hagar \"began to despise her mistress\" (Genesis 16:4). Then Sarah mistreated Hagar, who fled. God spoke to the slave Hagar in the desert, sent her home, and she bore Abraham a son, [[Ishmael]], \"a wild donkey of a man\" (Genesis 16:12).\n\nWhen Ishmael was 13, Abraham received the covenant practice of circumcision, and circumcised every male of his household. Later \"Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.

Samson was a [[Nazarite]], a specially dedicated individual, from birth, yet his story indicates he violated every requirement of the Nazarite vow.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Long hair was one of the symbolic representations of his special relationship with God; no razor was supposed to touch his hair. Samson travels to Gaza and \"fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, \u201cSee if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.\u201d Samson lies to her a couple of times then tells her the truth. \"Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.\"\n\n\"Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, \u201cOur god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.\u201d And they brought Samson out to entertain each other. But Samson prayed, \"O Lord, remember me\" and he pushed the columns holding up the Temple and killed everyone there.\n\nThe story does not call Delilah a Philistine. The valley of Sorek was Danite territory that had been overrun by Philistines, so the population there would have been mixed. Delilah was likely an Israelite or the story would have said otherwise.  The Philistines offered Delilah an enormous sum of money to betray Samson. Art has generally portrayed Delilah as a type of femme fatale, but the biblical term used (patt\u00ee) means to persuade with words. Delilah uses emotional blackmail and Samson's genuine love for her to betray him. No other Hebrew biblical hero is ever defeated by an Israelite woman. Samson does not suspect, perhaps because he cannot think of a woman as dangerous, but Delilah is determined, bold and very dangerous indeed. The entire Philistine army could not bring him down.

She was married to Judah's son [[Er (biblical person)|Er]], but Er died, leaving Tamar childless. Under levirate law, Judah's next son, [[Onan]], was told to have sex with Tamar and give her a child, but when Onan slept with her, he \"spilled his seed on the ground\" rather than give her a child that would belong to his brother. Then Onan died too. \"Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Live as a widow in your father\u2019s household until my son Shelah grows up.' For he thought, 'He may die too, just like his brothers'.\" (Genesis 38:11) But when Shelah grew up, she was not given to him as his wife. One day Judah travels to town (Timnah) to shear his sheep. Tamar \"took off her widow\u2019s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.  When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, 'Come now, let me sleep with you'.\"(Genesis 38:14) He said he would give her something in return and she asked for a pledge, accepting his staff and his seal with its cord as earnest of later payment. So Judah slept with her and she became pregnant. Then she went home and put on her widow's weeds again. Months later when it was discovered she was pregnant, she was accused of prostitution (zonah), and was set to be burned.  Instead, she sent Judah's pledge offerings to him saying \"I am pregnant by the man who owns these.\" Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, since I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d\n\n====Jephthah's daughter====\n{{Main|Jephthah's daughter}}\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Daughter of Jephthah (1879, Oil on canvas).JPG|thumb|upright|''The Daughter of Jephthah'', by [[Alexandre Cabanel]] (1879).]]\nThe story of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Book of Judges begins as an archetypal biblical hagiography of a hero. Jephthah is the son of a marginal woman, a prostitute (zonah), and as such he is vulnerable.  He lives in his father's house, but when his father dies, his half-brothers reject him. According to Frymer-Kensky, \"This is not right.  In the ancient Near East prostitutes could be hired as surrogate wombs as well as sex objects. Laws and contracts regulated the relationship between the child of such a prostitute and children of the first wife... he could not be disinherited. Jephthah has been wronged, but he has no recourse. He must leave home.\"  Frymer-Kensky says the author assumes the biblical audience is familiar with this, will know Jephthah has been wronged, and will be sympathetic to him.<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002>{{cite book|last1=Frymer-Kensky|first1=Tikva|title=Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories|url=https://archive.org/details/readingwomenofbi00frym|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Schoken Books|location=New York|isbn=9780805211825|oclc=49823086}}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013115}}\n\nNevertheless, Jephthah goes out into the world and makes a name for himself as a mighty warrior\u2014a hero of Israel. The threat of [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|the Ammonites]] is grave. The brothers acknowledge their wrongdoing to gain his protection.  Frymer-Kensky says Jephthah's response reveals negotiation skills and deep piety. Then he attempts to negotiate peace with Ammon but fails.  War comes, with all of Israel vulnerable.  Before the battle he makes a battle vow: \"If you give the Ammonites into my hand...the one who comes out of the doors of my house...I will offer to YHWH.\"  This turns out to be his daughter. Jephthah's reaction expresses his horror and sense of tragedy in three key expressions of mourning, utter defeat, and reproach. He reproaches her and himself, but foresees only his doom in either keeping or breaking his vow. Jephthah's daughter responds to his speech and she becomes a true heroine of this story. They are both good, yet tragedy happens.

Immediately after explaining Amnon's desire the narrator first uses the term sister to reveal Tamar is not only Absalom's sister but is also Amnon's sister by another mother.

MacDonald explains that, \"In Celsus' work, Mary Magdalene's role in the resurrection story denigrates its credibility...

Historically, artistic renderings tend to reflect the changing views on women from within society more than the biblical account that mentions them.\n\nEve is a common subject. Art historian Mati Meyer says society's views of women are observable in the differing renderings of Eve in art over the centuries. Meyer explains: \"Genesis 2\u20133 recounts the creation of man and the origins of evil and death; Eve, the temptress who disobeys God\u2019s commandment, is probably the most widely discussed and portrayed figure in art.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\">{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=Mati|title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women|website=Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref> According to Mati Meyer, Eve is historically portrayed in a favorable light up through the [[Early Middle Ages]] (AD 800's), but by the [[Late Middle Ages]] (1400s) artistic interpretation of Eve becomes heavily misogynistic.  Meyer sees this change as influenced by the writings of the 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]], \"who sees Eve\u2019s sexuality as destructive to male rationality\".<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>  By the seventeenth century, the [[Fall of man]] as a male-female struggle emerges, and in the eighteenth century, the perception of Eve is influenced by [[John Milton]]s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' where Adam's free will is emphasized along with Eve's beauty. Thereafter a secular view of Eve emerges \"through her transformation into a ''[[femme fatale]]''\u2014a compound of beauty, seductiveness and independence set to destroy the man.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>\n\nCourageous and victorious women, such as Jael, Esther and the [[deuterocanonical]] [[Judith]], were popular \"moral\" figures in the Middle Ages. [[The Renaissance]], which preferred the sensuous female nude up through the eighteenth century, and the \"femme fatale\", such as Delilah, from the nineteenth century onward, all demonstrate how the Bible and art both shape and reflect views of women.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women | title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women &#124; Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref><ref name=\"Diane Apostolos-Cappadona\">{{Cite journal|last1=Apostolos-Cappadona|first1=Diane|title=Women in Religious Art|volume=1|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.208|date=Jul 2016|isbn=9780199340378}}</ref>\n\nThe story of the biblical Queen Athaliah was the inspiration for one of the greatest tragedies of French dramatist [[Jean Racine]], ''[[Athalie]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1897/12/07/archives/athalie-played-at-harvard-racines-masterpiece-produced-before-a.html | work=The New York Times | title=\"ATHALIE\" PLAYED AT HARVARD; Racine's Masterpiece Produced Before a Brilliant Audience in Sander's Theatre -- Gov.

Views on sexuality in the early church were diverse and fiercely debated within its various communities; these doctrinal debates took place within the boundaries of the ideas in Paul's letters and in the context of an often persecuted minority seeking to define itself from the world around it.  In his letters, Paul often attempted to find a middle way among these disputes, which included people who saw the gospel as liberating them from all moral boundaries, and those who took very strict moral stances.<ref name=\"Kyle Harper\"/>{{rp|1\u201314,84\u201386,88}}  Conflicts over sexuality with the culture surrounding Christianity, as well as within Christianity itself, were fierce.

This suggests that women were not usually in the forefront of public life. Those women that are named, rose to prominence for reasons outside the ordinary. They are often an aspect of the over-turning of man-made power structures commonly found in a biblical literary device called a \"reversal.\" [[Abigail]] and [[Esther]], [[Jael]] who drove a tent peg into the enemy commander's temple while he slept, are a few examples of women who turned the tables on men with power. The [[Matriarchs (Bible)|founding matriarchs]] are mentioned by name, as are some prophetesses, judges, heroines, and queens, while the common woman is largely, though not completely, unseen. The slave [[Hagar]]'s story is told, and the prostitute [[Rahab]]'s story is also told, along with a few others like them.\n\nAll [[Ancient Near East]]ern societies were [[patriarchal]], and the Bible is a patriarchal document, written by men from a patriarchal age.  Many scholars see the primary emphasis of the Bible as reinforcing women's subordinate status. However, there are also scholars who claim there is a kind of [[gender blindness]] in the Bible as well as patriarchy. Marital laws in the Bible favored men, as did inheritance laws. There were strict laws of sexual behavior with adultery a crime punishable by [[stoning]]. A woman in ancient biblical times was always under the authority of a man and was subject to strict purity laws, both ritual and moral. However, women such as [[Deborah]], the [[Woman of Shunem|Shunnemite woman]], and the prophetess [[Huldah]], rise above societal limitations in their stories. The Bible contains many noted narratives of women as both victors and victims, women who change the course of events, and women who are powerless and unable to affect their own destinies.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] refers to a number of women in [[Jesus]]\u2019 inner circle, and he is generally seen by scholars as dealing with women with respect. The New Testament names women in positions of leadership in the early church as well. There are controversies within the contemporary Christian church concerning women. For example, [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] as \"outstanding among the apostles\" and there is disagreement over whether Junia was a woman and an apostle, and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s role as a leader is also disputed. Sexuality has played a major role in these issues which have impacted, and continue to impact, how the modern Christian church sees the role of women. These changing views of women in the Bible are reflected in art and culture.\n\n==Women, sex, and law in surrounding cultures==\nAlmost all Near Eastern societies of the Bronze (3000-1200 BCE) and Axial Ages (800 to 300 BCE) were patriarchal with patriarchy established in most by 3000 BCE.<ref name=\"Henry Sumner Maine\">{{cite book |last1=Maine |first1=Henry Sumner |title=Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation With to Modern Ideas |date=2015|publisher=Palala Press|isbn= 978-1340712365|quote=Originally Published in 1874 by Henry Holt and Company, New York; Republished as Historically Significant.}}</ref>{{rp|xxxii}} Eastern societies such as the [[Akkadians]], [[Hittites]], [[Assyria]]ns and [[Persians]] relegated women to an inferior and subordinate position.

The exact number of named and unnamed women in the Bible is somewhat uncertain because of a number of difficulties involved in calculating the total. For example, the Bible sometimes uses different names for the same woman, names in different languages can be translated differently, and some names can be used for either men or women. Professor Karla Bombach says one study produced a total of 3000-3100 names, 2900 of which are men with 170 of the total being women. However, the possibility of duplication produced the recalculation of a total of 1700 distinct personal names in the Bible with 137 of them being women.  In yet another study of the Hebrew Bible only, there were a total of 1426 names with 1315 belonging to men and 111 to women.

For example, a husband could divorce a wife if he chose to, but a wife could not divorce a husband without his consent. The law said a woman could not make a binding vow without consent of her male authority, so she could not legally marry without male approval.  The practice of [[levirate marriage]] applied to widows of childless deceased husbands, not to widowers of childless deceased wives; though, if either he or she didn't consent to the marriage, a different ceremony called ''[[chalitza]]'' was done instead; this involves the widow removing her brother-in-law's shoe, spitting in front of him, and proclaiming, \"This is what happens to someone who will not build his brother's house!\".<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|163}} Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. Women in biblical times depended on men economically. Women had the right to own property jointly with their husbands, except in the rare case of inheriting land from a father who didn't bear sons. Even \"in such cases, women would be required to remarry within the tribe so as not to reduce its land holdings.\"<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\"/>{{rp|171}} Property was transferred through the male line and women could not inherit unless there were no male heirs (Numbers 27:1-11; 36:1-12).<ref name = \"Davies1\"/>{{rp|3}} These and other gender-based differences found in the Torah suggest that women were seen as subordinate to men; however, they also suggest that biblical society viewed continuity, property, and family unity as paramount.<ref name=\"HauptmanEtz\" />\n\nPhilosopher Michael Berger says, the rural family was the backbone of biblical society. Women did tasks as important as those of men, managed their households, and were equals in daily life, but all public decisions were made by men. Men had specific obligations they were required to perform for their wives including the provision of clothing, food, and sexual relations.<ref>[[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, Joseph]].

The ''zonah'' is shown as lacking protection, making each ''zonah'' vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren't.

Sarah gives her slave Hagar to Abraham and he has sexual relations with her and she becomes pregnant. Sarah hopes to build a family through Hagar, but Hagar \"began to despise her mistress\" (Genesis 16:4). Then Sarah mistreated Hagar, who fled. God spoke to the slave Hagar in the desert, sent her home, and she bore Abraham a son, [[Ishmael]], \"a wild donkey of a man\" (Genesis 16:12).\n\nWhen Ishmael was 13, Abraham received the covenant practice of circumcision, and circumcised every male of his household. Later \"Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.

Samson was a [[Nazarite]], a specially dedicated individual, from birth, yet his story indicates he violated every requirement of the Nazarite vow.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Long hair was one of the symbolic representations of his special relationship with God; no razor was supposed to touch his hair.

The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, \u201cSee if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.\u201d Samson lies to her a couple of times then tells her the truth. \"Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison.

But Samson prayed, \"O Lord, remember me\" and he pushed the columns holding up the Temple and killed everyone there.\n\nThe story does not call Delilah a Philistine. The valley of Sorek was Danite territory that had been overrun by Philistines, so the population there would have been mixed. Delilah was likely an Israelite or the story would have said otherwise.  The Philistines offered Delilah an enormous sum of money to betray Samson. Art has generally portrayed Delilah as a type of femme fatale, but the biblical term used (patt\u00ee) means to persuade with words. Delilah uses emotional blackmail and Samson's genuine love for her to betray him. No other Hebrew biblical hero is ever defeated by an Israelite woman. Samson does not suspect, perhaps because he cannot think of a woman as dangerous, but Delilah is determined, bold and very dangerous indeed. The entire Philistine army could not bring him down.

She was married to Judah's son [[Er (biblical person)|Er]], but Er died, leaving Tamar childless. Under levirate law, Judah's next son, [[Onan]], was told to have sex with Tamar and give her a child, but when Onan slept with her, he \"spilled his seed on the ground\" rather than give her a child that would belong to his brother. Then Onan died too. \"Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Live as a widow in your father\u2019s household until my son Shelah grows up.' For he thought, 'He may die too, just like his brothers'.\" (Genesis 38:11) But when Shelah grew up, she was not given to him as his wife. One day Judah travels to town (Timnah) to shear his sheep. Tamar \"took off her widow\u2019s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.  When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, 'Come now, let me sleep with you'.\"(Genesis 38:14) He said he would give her something in return and she asked for a pledge, accepting his staff and his seal with its cord as earnest of later payment. So Judah slept with her and she became pregnant. Then she went home and put on her widow's weeds again. Months later when it was discovered she was pregnant, she was accused of prostitution (zonah), and was set to be burned.  Instead, she sent Judah's pledge offerings to him saying \"I am pregnant by the man who owns these.\" Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, since I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d\n\n====Jephthah's daughter====\n{{Main|Jephthah's daughter}}\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Daughter of Jephthah (1879, Oil on canvas).JPG|thumb|upright|''The Daughter of Jephthah'', by [[Alexandre Cabanel]] (1879).]]\nThe story of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Book of Judges begins as an archetypal biblical hagiography of a hero. Jephthah is the son of a marginal woman, a prostitute (zonah), and as such he is vulnerable.  He lives in his father's house, but when his father dies, his half-brothers reject him. According to Frymer-Kensky, \"This is not right.  In the ancient Near East prostitutes could be hired as surrogate wombs as well as sex objects. Laws and contracts regulated the relationship between the child of such a prostitute and children of the first wife... he could not be disinherited. Jephthah has been wronged, but he has no recourse. He must leave home.\"  Frymer-Kensky says the author assumes the biblical audience is familiar with this, will know Jephthah has been wronged, and will be sympathetic to him.<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002>{{cite book|last1=Frymer-Kensky|first1=Tikva|title=Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories|url=https://archive.org/details/readingwomenofbi00frym|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Schoken Books|location=New York|isbn=9780805211825|oclc=49823086}}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013115}}\n\nNevertheless, Jephthah goes out into the world and makes a name for himself as a mighty warrior\u2014a hero of Israel. The threat of [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|the Ammonites]] is grave. The brothers acknowledge their wrongdoing to gain his protection.  Frymer-Kensky says Jephthah's response reveals negotiation skills and deep piety. Then he attempts to negotiate peace with Ammon but fails.  War comes, with all of Israel vulnerable.  Before the battle he makes a battle vow: \"If you give the Ammonites into my hand...the one who comes out of the doors of my house...I will offer to YHWH.\"  This turns out to be his daughter. Jephthah's reaction expresses his horror and sense of tragedy in three key expressions of mourning, utter defeat, and reproach. He reproaches her and himself, but foresees only his doom in either keeping or breaking his vow. Jephthah's daughter responds to his speech and she becomes a true heroine of this story. They are both good, yet tragedy happens.  Frymer-Kensky summarizes: \"The vulnerable heroine is sacrificed, the hero's name is gone.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/>  She adds, the author of the book of Judges knew people were sacrificing their children and the narrator of Judges is in opposition. \"The horror is the very reason this story is in the book of Judges.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/>{{rp|115}}\n\nSome scholars have interpreted this story to mean that Jephthah's daughter was not actually sacrificed, but kept in seclusion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hirsch|first1=Emil G.|last2=Seligsohn|first2=M. |last3=Schechter|first3=Solomon|last4=Barton|first4=George A.|editor1-last=Cyrus Adler|editor1-first=|display-editors=etal|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|date=1906|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8584-jephthah|chapter=Jephthah (\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7)|location=New York|publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Anne E|editor1-last=Newsom|editor1-first=Carol A.|editor2-last=Ringe|editor2-first=Sharon H.|editor3-last=Lapsley|editor3-first=Jacqueline E.|title=Women's Bible commentary|date=2012|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky|isbn=9780664237073|pages=133\u2013137|edition= 3rd, 20th anniversary|chapter=Jephthah's Daughter and her Interpreters|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uUMZ_g2_NoC&pg=PA136}}</ref>{{rp|137}}\n\n====Tamar, daughter of David====\n{{Main|Tamar (daughter of David)}}\n[[File:Desolation of Tamar by J.Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|upright .8|Desolation of Tamar by J.Tissot, c. 1900]]\nThe story of Tamar is a literary unit consisting of seven parts. According to Frymer-Kensky, the story \"has received a great deal of attention as a superb piece of literature, and several have concentrated on explicating the artistry involved.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/>{{rp|399}} This story (2 Samuel) focuses on three of King [[David]]'s children, [[Amnon]] the first born, [[Absalom]] the beloved son, and his beautiful sister Tamar.<ref name=Trible1984terror/>{{rp|38}}\n\nAmnon desires Tamar deeply. Immediately after explaining Amnon's desire the narrator first uses the term sister to reveal Tamar is not only Absalom's sister but is also Amnon's sister by another mother.  Phyllis Trible says the storyteller \"stresses family ties for such intimacy exacerbates the coming tragedy.\"  Full of lust, the prince is impotent to act; Tamar is a virgin and protected property. Then comes a plan from his cousin [[Jonadab]], \"a very crafty man.\"<ref name=Trible1984terror/>{{rp|39}}\n\nJonadab's scheme to aid Amnon pivots on David the king.

The king orders it sending a message to Tamar.<ref name=Trible1984terror/>{{rp|44}}  Amnon sends the servants away. Alone with her brother she is vulnerable, but Tamar claims her voice. Frymer-Kensky says Tamar speaks to Amnon with wisdom, but she speaks to a foolish man. She attempts to dissuade him, then offers the alternative of marriage, and tells him to appeal to the king. He does not listen, and rapes her.<ref name=Trible1984terror/>{{rp|45}}\n\nAmnon is immediately full of shame and angrily throws Tamar out. \u201cNo!\u201d she said to him. \u201cSending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.\u201d But he refuses to listen. Tamar is desolate: ruined and miserable. King David is furious but he does nothing to avenge his daughter or punish his son. Frymer Kensky says \"The reader of the story who expects that the state will provide protection for the vulnerable now sees that the state cannot control itself.\"<ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/>{{rp|174}} Absalom is filled with hatred, and kills Amnon two years later.

But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.\"\n\n====1 Timothy 5:3-16====\n\n1 Timothy 5:3-16 states in the Authorized Version \"Honour widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.  Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.  But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.  And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.  But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. For some are already turned aside after Satan. If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.\"\n\n====1 Corinthians 11:2-16====\nIn the King James translation these verses read as \"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.\nFor this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.\"\n\n===1 Peter on women===\n\n{{See also|Saint Peter|Authorship of the Petrine epistles}}\n\nIn 1 Peter 3 wives are exhorted to submit to their husbands \"so they may be won over.\" (''Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives\u2019 conduct'').\n\n===Contemporary views===\nThere is no contemporary consensus on the New Testament view of women.

Its purpose was to challenge Liberal theology of the time that supported the orthodox position that woman should be subservient to man. The book attracted a great deal of controversy and antagonism.

Historically, artistic renderings tend to reflect the changing views on women from within society more than the biblical account that mentions them.\n\nEve is a common subject. Art historian Mati Meyer says society's views of women are observable in the differing renderings of Eve in art over the centuries. Meyer explains: \"Genesis 2\u20133 recounts the creation of man and the origins of evil and death; Eve, the temptress who disobeys God\u2019s commandment, is probably the most widely discussed and portrayed figure in art.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\">{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=Mati|title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women|website=Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref> According to Mati Meyer, Eve is historically portrayed in a favorable light up through the [[Early Middle Ages]] (AD 800's), but by the [[Late Middle Ages]] (1400s) artistic interpretation of Eve becomes heavily misogynistic.  Meyer sees this change as influenced by the writings of the 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]], \"who sees Eve\u2019s sexuality as destructive to male rationality\".<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>  By the seventeenth century, the [[Fall of man]] as a male-female struggle emerges, and in the eighteenth century, the perception of Eve is influenced by [[John Milton]]s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' where Adam's free will is emphasized along with Eve's beauty. Thereafter a secular view of Eve emerges \"through her transformation into a ''[[femme fatale]]''\u2014a compound of beauty, seductiveness and independence set to destroy the man.\"<ref name=\"Mati Meyer\"/>\n\nCourageous and victorious women, such as Jael, Esther and the [[deuterocanonical]] [[Judith]], were popular \"moral\" figures in the Middle Ages. [[The Renaissance]], which preferred the sensuous female nude up through the eighteenth century, and the \"femme fatale\", such as Delilah, from the nineteenth century onward, all demonstrate how the Bible and art both shape and reflect views of women.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women | title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women &#124; Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref><ref name=\"Diane Apostolos-Cappadona\">{{Cite journal|last1=Apostolos-Cappadona|first1=Diane|title=Women in Religious Art|volume=1|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.208|date=Jul 2016|isbn=9780199340378}}</ref>\n\nThe story of the biblical Queen Athaliah was the inspiration for one of the greatest tragedies of French dramatist [[Jean Racine]], ''[[Athalie]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1897/12/07/archives/athalie-played-at-harvard-racines-masterpiece-produced-before-a.html | work=The New York Times | title=\"ATHALIE\" PLAYED AT HARVARD; Racine's Masterpiece Produced Before a Brilliant Audience in Sander's Theatre -- Gov.

Views on sexuality in the early church were diverse and fiercely debated within its various communities; these doctrinal debates took place within the boundaries of the ideas in Paul's letters and in the context of an often persecuted minority seeking to define itself from the world around it.  In his letters, Paul often attempted to find a middle way among these disputes, which included people who saw the gospel as liberating them from all moral boundaries, and those who took very strict moral stances.<ref name=\"Kyle Harper\"/>{{rp|1\u201314,84\u201386,88}}  Conflicts over sexuality with the culture surrounding Christianity, as well as within Christianity itself, were fierce.
