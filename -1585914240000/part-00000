They are from Walsall, West Midlands in the United Kingdom.\n\nFormed in late 2013 from the fragments of two local bands, Stone Broken comprises Rich Moss, vocals and guitar, Chris Davis, lead guitar, Robyn Haycock, drums and backing vocals, and Kieron Conroy, bass.\n\nThe band self-released their debut EP, The Crow Flies, in 2014. Their first full-length album, All In Time, was released independently in January 2016. Having signed to the Frontiers label later that year, the contract was subsequently dissolved and Stone Broken signed to the Spinefarm label in 2017. In 2018 the band released their second album, Ain\u2019t Always Easy. In late 2019, the debut album was re-issued on Spinefarm, and included a re-recording of their best known song, \"Wait For You\".\n\n== History ==\n\nStone Broken was formed in early 2013 when Richard Moss and Robyn Haycock decided to start a new band following the death of the guitar player in their previous band, Black Lake, as a consequence of alcohol addiction. They were joined by bass player Kieron Conroy, who had previously been in a band called Black Diamond Bullet. Kieron introduced his new bandmates to guitarist Chris Davis, who had also played in Black Diamond Bullet. The name Stone Broken was decided upon after drummer Robyn noted that the money required to get the band established would in all probability leave them \u2018stone broke\u2019.<ref>Will Simpson, [https://www.loudersound.com/features/stone-broken-there-are-worse-people-to-be-compared-to-than-nickelback \"Stone Broken\"], ''Louder'', 24 November 2016.

They recorded a two-track promotional single towards the end of 2013 featuring the tracks This Life and Fall Back Down, the latter available to download from their official website. However, it wasn't until March 2014 that Stone Broken played their first public gig supporting a Motorhead tribute band at the Route 44 venue in Birmingham.\n\nThe band approached producer Romesh Dodangoda at Long Wave Studios in South Wales to produce a debut EP consisting of five original tracks. This EP, The Crow Flies, was self-released in October 2014, supported by a music performance video for the track Let Me Go.\n \nThe band played further shows in the first part of 2015 and returned to Long Wave Studios with a view to recording a second EP, to feature another five tracks. However, when the new recordings were completed, it was decided to collate an album from the ten songs recorded to date. \nBy October 2015, Stone Broken signed a management deal with Peter Keevil of TMR Band Management. A month later the band announced that their debut album, entitled All In Time, was to be released worldwide on Friday 29 January 2016.\n\nAll In Time features 10 tracks, produced and remastered by Romesh Dodangoda.\nStone Broken released Stay All Night as the first official single from All In Time on Friday 27 November 2015. It was accompanied by a video produced by Video Ink. The release was named single of the week on Kerrang!

The name is a corruption of 'wind gates' due to the swirling winds through the pass. It lies west of the village of [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]], in the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s [[High Peak Estate]] and the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] borough of Derbyshire. The road winds through a cleft, surrounded by high limestone ridges. At the foot of the pass is the entrance to [[Speedwell Cavern]], a [[Solutional cave|karst cave]] accessed through a flooded lead mine, and which is a popular tourist attraction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.showcaves.com/english/gb/showcaves/Speedwell.html|title=Speedwell Cavern|website=showcaves.com|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nA local legend is that the pass is haunted by a young couple Alan and Clara who eloped in 1758, only to be robbed and murdered by miners as they headed through Winnats Pass, on their way to Peak Forest Chapel.

All these sediments were subsequently buried together under [[Namurian]] sandstones and shales in the subsequent [[Upper Carboniferous]] period. They were subsequently uplifted, but were only re-exposed by [[periglacial]] erosion towards the end of the [[Pleistocene]].

Glossop is the third busiest railway station in the county of Derbyshire after [[Derby railway station|Derby]] and [[Chesterfield railway station|Chesterfield]]. It is estimated 901,000 people used the station in 2016/17.\n\nThe station is {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Manchester Piccadilly station]], and is the terminus of the [[Glossop Line]]. Together with nearby Derbyshire stations at [[Hadfield railway station|Hadfield]] and [[Dinting railway station|Dinting]], Glossop is considered to be part of the [[Greater Manchester]] rail network as it lies only a short distance over the county boundary and the line goes no further into Derbyshire. For that reason the station signs at Glossop feature the [[Transport for Greater Manchester]] (TfGM) logo, and the station features on the TfGM rail network map.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfgm.com/journey_planning/Documents/PDFMaps/Greater-Manchester-Rail-Tickets-Area-Map.pdf |title=Greater Manchester Rail Network |accessdate=13 October 2014 }}</ref> However, Greater Manchester concessionary fares do not apply to passengers travelling from Glossop, Dinting or Hadfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfgm.com/journey_planning/Documents/PDFMaps/Concessionary-Fares-Map.pdf | title = Greater Manchester Concessionary Fare Map |accessdate=13 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Glossop 9 67555 1 copy.jpg|thumb|left|Glossop station in 1967]]\n[[Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk]] built the [[spur line]] from [[Dinting viaduct]] to Howard Town over his own land at his own expense.

The station is one of the twin termini at the Derbyshire end of the [[Manchester-Glossop Line]], the other being [[Glossop railway station|Glossop]].

Passenger trains on the [[Woodhead Line]] were withdrawn east of Hadfield on 5 January 1970, followed by complete closure in 1981.

ACM Computing Surveys, Volume 44, Issue 4, Pages 20:1-20:36.</ref> The process is usually split into the following eight tasks, which are not all necessarily applied in every ontology learning system.\n\n=== Domain terminology extraction ===\nDuring the domain [[terminology extraction]] step, domain-specific terms are extracted, which are used in the following step (concept discovery) to derive concepts. Relevant terms can be determined e. g. by calculation of the [[tf*idf|TF/IDF]] values or by application of the C-value / NC-value method. The resulting list of terms has to be filtered by a domain expert. In the subsequent step, similarly to coreference resolution in [[information extraction]], the OL system determines synonyms, because they share the same meaning and therefore correspond to the same concept. The most common methods therefore are clustering and the application of statistical similarity measures.\n\n=== Concept discovery ===\n\nIn the concept discovery step, terms are grouped to meaning bearing units, which correspond to an abstraction of the world and therefore to [[concept]]s. The grouped terms are these domain-specific terms and their synonyms, which were identified in the domain terminology extraction step.\n\n=== Concept hierarchy derivation ===\n\nIn the concept hierarchy derivation step, the OL system tries to arrange the extracted concepts in a taxonomic structure. This is mostly achieved by unsupervised [[hierarchical clustering]] methods. Because the result of such methods is often noisy, a supervision, e. g. by evaluation by the user, is integrated. A further method for the derivation of a concept hierarchy exists in the usage of several patterns, which should indicate a [[Is-a|sub- or supersumption relationship]]. Patterns like \u201cX, that is a Y\u201d or \u201cX is a Y\u201d indicate, that X is a subclass of Y. Such pattern can be analyzed efficiently, but they occur too infrequent, to extract enough sub- or supersumption relationships. Instead bootstrapping methods are developed, which learn these patterns automatically and therefore ensure a higher coverage.\n\n=== Learning of non-taxonomic relations ===\n\nAt the learning of non-taxonomic relations step, relationships are extracted, which do not express any sub- or supersumption. Such relationships are e.g. works-for or located-in. There are two common approaches to solve this subtask. The first one is based upon the extraction of anonymous associations, which are named appropriately in a second step. The second approach extracts verbs, which indicate a relationship between the entities, represented by the surrounding words. But the result of both approaches has to be evaluated by an ontologist.\n\n=== Rule discovery ===\n\nDuring [[Association rule learning|rule discovery]],<ref name=\"Voelker\">Johanna V\u00f6lker; [[Pascal Hitzler]]; Cimiano, Philipp (2007). \"Acquisition of OWL DL Axioms from Lexical Resources\", ''Proceedings of the 4th European conference on The Semantic Web'', p. 670 - 685, http://smartweb.dfki.de/Vortraege/lexo_2007.pdf (retrieved: 18.06.2012).</ref> axioms (formal description of concepts) are generated for the extracted concepts. This can be achieved for example by analyzing the syntactic structure of a natural language definition and the application of transformation rules on the resulting dependency tree. The result of this process is a list of axioms, which is afterwards comprehended to a concept description. This one has to be evaluated by an ontologist.\n\n=== Ontology population ===\n\nAt this step, the ontology is augmented with instances of concepts and properties. For the augmentation with instances of concepts, methods based on the matching of lexico-syntactic patterns are used. Instances of properties are added by application of [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping methods]], which collect relation tuples.\n\n=== Concept hierarchy extension ===\n\nIn this step, the OL system tries to extend the taxonomic structure of an existing ontology with further concepts. This can be realized supervised by a trained classifier or unsupervised by the application of [[similarity measure]]s.\n\n=== Frame and event detection ===\n\nDuring frame/event detection, the OL system tries to extract complex relationships from text, e.g. who departed from where to what place and when. Approaches range from applying SVM with [[kernel method]]s to semantic role labeling (SRL)<ref name=\"Coppola09\">Coppola B.; Gangemi A.; Gliozzo A.; Picca D.; Presutti V.

ACM Computing Surveys, Volume 44, Issue 4, Pages 20:1-20:36.</ref> The process is usually split into the following eight tasks, which are not all necessarily applied in every ontology learning system.\n\n=== Domain terminology extraction ===\nDuring the domain [[terminology extraction]] step, domain-specific terms are extracted, which are used in the following step (concept discovery) to derive concepts. Relevant terms can be determined e. g. by calculation of the [[tf*idf|TF/IDF]] values or by application of the C-value / NC-value method. The resulting list of terms has to be filtered by a domain expert. In the subsequent step, similarly to coreference resolution in [[information extraction]], the OL system determines synonyms, because they share the same meaning and therefore correspond to the same concept. The most common methods therefore are clustering and the application of statistical similarity measures.\n\n=== Concept discovery ===\n\nIn the concept discovery step, terms are grouped to meaning bearing units, which correspond to an abstraction of the world and therefore to [[concept]]s. The grouped terms are these domain-specific terms and their synonyms, which were identified in the domain terminology extraction step.\n\n=== Concept hierarchy derivation ===\n\nIn the concept hierarchy derivation step, the OL system tries to arrange the extracted concepts in a taxonomic structure. This is mostly achieved by unsupervised [[hierarchical clustering]] methods. Because the result of such methods is often noisy, a supervision, e. g. by evaluation by the user, is integrated. A further method for the derivation of a concept hierarchy exists in the usage of several patterns, which should indicate a [[Is-a|sub- or supersumption relationship]]. Patterns like \u201cX, that is a Y\u201d or \u201cX is a Y\u201d indicate, that X is a subclass of Y. Such pattern can be analyzed efficiently, but they occur too infrequent, to extract enough sub- or supersumption relationships. Instead bootstrapping methods are developed, which learn these patterns automatically and therefore ensure a higher coverage.\n\n=== Learning of non-taxonomic relations ===\n\nAt the learning of non-taxonomic relations step, relationships are extracted, which do not express any sub- or supersumption. Such relationships are e.g. works-for or located-in. There are two common approaches to solve this subtask. The first one is based upon the extraction of anonymous associations, which are named appropriately in a second step. The second approach extracts verbs, which indicate a relationship between the entities, represented by the surrounding words. But the result of both approaches has to be evaluated by an ontologist.\n\n=== Rule discovery ===\n\nDuring [[Association rule learning|rule discovery]],<ref name=\"Voelker\">Johanna V\u00f6lker; [[Pascal Hitzler]]; Cimiano, Philipp (2007). \"Acquisition of OWL DL Axioms from Lexical Resources\", ''Proceedings of the 4th European conference on The Semantic Web'', p. 670 - 685, http://smartweb.dfki.de/Vortraege/lexo_2007.pdf (retrieved: 18.06.2012).</ref> axioms (formal description of concepts) are generated for the extracted concepts. This can be achieved for example by analyzing the syntactic structure of a natural language definition and the application of transformation rules on the resulting dependency tree. The result of this process is a list of axioms, which is afterwards comprehended to a concept description. This one has to be evaluated by an ontologist.\n\n=== Ontology population ===\n\nAt this step, the ontology is augmented with instances of concepts and properties. For the augmentation with instances of concepts, methods based on the matching of lexico-syntactic patterns are used. Instances of properties are added by application of [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping methods]], which collect relation tuples.\n\n=== Concept hierarchy extension ===\n\nIn this step, the OL system tries to extend the taxonomic structure of an existing ontology with further concepts. This can be realized supervised by a trained classifier or unsupervised by the application of [[Similarity measure|similarity measures]].\n\n=== Frame and event detection ===\n\nDuring frame/event detection, the OL system tries to extract complex relationships from text, e.g. who departed from where to what place and when. Approaches range from applying SVM with [[Kernel method|kernel methods]] to semantic role labeling (SRL)<ref name=\"Coppola09\">Coppola B.; Gangemi A.; Gliozzo A.; Picca D.; Presutti V.

Both the configuration and the responsibilities were altered several times during that period. Area Health Authorities, which existed from 1974 to 1982, were an intermediate tier created by the 1974 reorganisation. The most common complaint in evidence about the reorganisation of the NHS made to the [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] was that it added an extra and unnecessary tier of management.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 4|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0101761503|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-4/|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Authorities in Northern Region==\n\n===District authorities created 1982===\nSixteen district health authorities were formed in the Northern Region in 1982, replacing nine area health authorities:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
