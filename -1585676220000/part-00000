The first group of fathers reached [[Lhasa]] (Tibet) in 1707 and began Church work there. For nearly 41 years the Capuchin Fathers worked in Lhasa until a religious persecution forced them to give up their mission and move to Kathmandu (Nepal) in 1745.\n\nNepal had seen the Capuchin Fathers working with varying success in Kathmandu since 1715. A new conqueror of Kathmandu valley, Raja Pritvi Narayan, who was not sympathetic to the Fathers stopped all support to them. The Mission of Nepal was also abandoned in 1769, and the Fathers with 62 Nepalese Christians and five catechumens moved to India. The Nepalese Christians and catechumens settled down at Chuhari near [[Bettiah]]. The scene of the capuchin Mission shifted now to the Indian soil. Fr Joseph Mary ofm cap, a saintly priest, founded the Bettiah Mission in 1745 after the King of Bettiah, Raja Druva Singh had obtained permission from Pope Benedict XIV.\n\nRome erected the Prefecture of Tibet-Hindustan into a Vicariate in 1812. In 1827 an Independent Patna Vicariate was created, comprising [[Bettiah]], [[Chuhari]], [[Patna City]], [[Dinapore]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Darjeeling]], [[Sikkim]], [[Nepal]], and adjacent territories. The saintly Anastasius Hartmann, was appointed its first Vicar Apostolic. With a Decree of Pope Leo XIII Patna Vicariate became a part of [[Allahabad]] diocese in 1886. The North Bihar Mission with its four stations of Bettiah, Chuhari, [[Chakhani]] and [[Latonah]] was entrusted to the Tyrolese Capuchins in 1886. In May 1892 the North Bihar Mission was made Bettiah - Nepal Prefecture with Fr Hilarion of Abtei, ofm cap, as its first Prefect. In 1919 this Prefecture was dissolved and joined to South Bihar to form the present Diocese of Patna.\n\nPope Benedict XV by a Decree on 10 September 1919 divided the Diocese of Allahabad into two. The Diocese of Patna was thus created. The Prefecture of Bettiah-Nepal was annexed to the new diocese. The Holy See entrusted [[Patna]] diocese to American [[Missouri]] Province of the [[Society of Jesus]]. Later, on 13 November 1930, after the division of Missouri Province, Patna diocese was entrusted to the [[Chicago]] Province of the [[Society of Jesus]]. Louis Van Hoeck, a [[Belgium|Belgian]] Jesuit, was ordained the first Bishop of Patna on 6 March 1921.\n\nThe Third Order Regular (T.O.R.) Franciscan Fathers from [[Pennsylvania]], USA came to Patna diocese to assist the Jesuits in 1938. The mission stations of Bhagalpur, [[Gokhla]], [[Poreyahat]] and [[Godda]] were assigned to them. In 1956 Bhagalpur was made a Prefecture and in 1965 it was created a Diocese with Msgr [[Urban Mc Garry]], [[T.O.R.]], as its First Bishop.\n\nThe forbidden Kingdom of Nepal was once again open for Fathers in 1951, thanks to the efforts of Fr. [[Marshall D. Moran]], S.J. Nepal was made an independent ecclesiastical unit in 1984 and Fr. Antony Sharma, S.J. was appointed as its First Mission Superior.\n\nOn 28 March 1980, Pope John Paul II, accepted the resignation of Bishop [[Augustine Wildermuth]] S.J., and divided the Patna diocese into two units: [[Patna]] and [[Muzzaffarpur]]. Fr Benedict J Osta S.J., was appointed Bishop of Patna.\n\nThe Diocese of Patna comprises in the State of [[Bihar]], the Districts of Patna, [[Nalanda]], Nawadah, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Jehanabad, Bhojpur, Bhabhua, Buxar and part of Munger.\n\n==Special churches==\n*[[Pro-Cathedral]]:\n**[[St Joseph's Pro-Cathedral, Patna]]\n\n==Leadership==\n* Arch[[bishop]]s of Patna ([[Latin Rite]])\n** [[William D'Souza|Archbishop William D\u2019Souza, S.J.]] (1 October 2007 \u2013 present)\n** Archbishop [[Benedict John Osta]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (76) (16 March 1999 \u2013 1 October 2007)\n* Bishops of Patna (Latn Rite)\n** Bishop [[Benedict John Osta]], S.J.
