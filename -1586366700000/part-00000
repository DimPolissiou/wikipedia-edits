Character attributes fall into one of seven categories: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points.

The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nTwenty-five years after the [[World War III|Great War]], Vault 76 is opened up and its residents given the task of repopulating the Wasteland. Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to a nuclear weapons silo and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.

Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks.

The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nTwenty-five years after the [[World War III|Great War]], Vault 76 is opened up and its residents given the task of repopulating the Wasteland. Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime. The player character is directed to a nuclear weapons silo and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.

In France, ''caf\u00e9 latte'' is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caff\u00e8 latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \"latte\" is in French called ''grand cr\u00e8me'' and in German ''Milchkaffee'' or (in Austria) ''[[Wiener Melange]]''.\n\nVariants include the chocolate-flavored [[Caff\u00e8 mocha|mocha]] or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as [[masala chai]] (spiced Indian tea), [[Mate (drink)|mate]], [[matcha]], [[turmeric]] or [[rooibos]]; other types of milk, such as [[soy milk]] or [[almond milk]], are also used.\n\n==Origin and history==\n[[File:Latte at Doppio Ristretto Chiang Mai 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Latte art]]]]\nCoffee and milk have been part of [[European cuisine]] since the 17th century. ''Caff\u00e8 e latte'', ''Milchkaffee'', ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' and ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public caf\u00e9s in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although ''Kapuziner'' is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in [[Vienna]] and [[Trieste]] in the 2nd half of 1700s as \"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\" (being the origin of the Italian [[cappuccino]]).\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term ''caff\u00e8 e latte'' was first used in English in 1867 by [[William Dean Howells]] in his essay \"Italian Journeys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00333261?query_type=word&queryword=latte&first=1&max_to_show=10&single=1&sort_type=alpha|title=Latte|edition=new online|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Kenneth Davids maintains that \"...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caff\u00e8 version of this drink is an American invention\".<ref name=\"Davids2001\">{{cite book|last=Davids|first=Kenneth|title=Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying, Fifth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqJsIcYOPcQC&pg=PA153|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2001-05-04|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-24665-5|pages=153\u2013}}</ref>{{dubious|date=October 2018}} The [[French language|French]] term ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' was used in caf\u00e9s in several countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French themselves started using the term ''caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me'' for coffee with milk or cream.\n\nThe [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian empire]] (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee houses, while in German homes it was still called ''Milchkaffee''. The Italians used the term ''caff\u00e8 latte'' domestically, but it is not known from caf\u00e9s like ''Florian'' in [[Venice]] or any other coffee houses or places where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WW2 both in Italy, and in cities like Vienna and London, ''[[espresso]]'' and ''cappuccino'' are the terms, ''latte'' is missing on coffee menus.\n\nIn Italian ''latte'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8latte|pron}}) means \"[[milk]]\"\u2014so ordering a \"latte\" in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.<ref>{{cite book|title=Espresso coffee|author-link=David Schomer|first=David|last=Schomer|edition=second|page=151|isbn=1-59404-031-1}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msadventuresinitaly.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-order-an-italian-coffee-in-italy/|title=Coffee traditions in Italy|publisher=Ms adventures in Italy|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Spanish the phrase ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' (coffee with milk) is used, which is by default served in a medium or large cup whereas the similar ''cortado'' (coffee with less milk) is served in a small cup.\n\nIn English-speaking countries ''latte'' is shorthand for ''caffelatte'' or ''caffellatte'' (from ''caff\u00e8 e latte'', \"coffee and milk\"), which is similar to the French ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'', the Spanish ''[[caf\u00e9 con leche]]'', the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''caf\u00e8 amb llet'' or the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''[[gal\u00e3o]].''\n\nThe [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]] claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, \"invented\" and \"made the latte a standard drink\" in the 1950s.

''Caff\u00e8 latte'' started replacing this term around 1996\u201397, but both names exist side by side, more often more similar than different in preparation.\n\n==Spelling variations==\nCoffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is ''caffellatte'' (the standard form; ''caffelatte'' is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from ''caff\u00e8 latte'' (with a [[grave accent]] over the e), while French is ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' (with an [[acute accent]]); Spanish is ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' and Portuguese is ''caf\u00e9 com leite''. Variants such as ''caf\u00e9 latte'', ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9'' and ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e8'' are commonly seen in English. A slang name for a caff\u00e8 latte is a 'lartay', although this spelling is considered informal and, in many places, impolite and disrespectful to Italian culture.\n\n==Current use==\n[[File:Caffe-Latte-Prague.JPG|thumb|Caff\u00e8 latte with latte art]]\nIn Italy, caff\u00e8 latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop [[moka pot]] and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the 'international' latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is generally not foamed, and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all).\n\nOutside Italy, a caff\u00e8 latte is typically prepared in a {{convert|240|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on}} glass or cup with one standard shot of [[espresso]] (either single, {{convert|30|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, or double, {{convert|60|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick on the top. In the US, a latte is often heavily sweetened, with 3% or even more sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/caffe-latte|title=Caff\u00e8 Latte|work=starbucks.com}}</ref>\n[[File:A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach,Australia.jpeg|thumb|A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach, Australia]]\nThe drink is related to a [[cappuccino]], the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a {{convert|20|mm}} thick layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand similar to the latte is the [[flat white]], which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk. In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino.\n\n==Iced latte==\nIn the United States, an iced latte is usually espresso and chilled milk poured over ice.<ref name=starbucksicedlatte>{{cite web|title=Iced Caff\u00e8 Latte|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/iced-caffe-latte?foodZone=9999|work=Starbucks.com|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> Unlike a hot latte, it does not usually contain steamed milk or foam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coffee Cafe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gwestJTfT8C&lpg=PA83&pg=PA83#v=onepage&f=false|first=Sherri|last=Johns|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84537-037-4}}</ref> Iced lattes almost always have sugar or flavoring syrups added, and are sometimes served blended with the ice.<ref name=Laskin>{{cite book|last=Laskin|first=Avner|title=Coffee: More Than 65 Delicious & Healthy Recipes|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4027-4937-7|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TB_Xu-SkJXQC&lpg=PA4&pg=PA46#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref> The espresso can be pre-chilled (sometimes as a mixture of espresso and milk) or frozen in advance to avoid warming up the drink.<ref name=moore>{{cite book|pages=144\u2013145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbLa7xGXxeIC&lpg=PA144&pg=PA144#v=onepage&f=false|last=Moore|first=Victoria|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date=Apr 22, 2010|isbn=978-0-7407-9845-0|title=How to Drink}}</ref>\n\n==Caff\u00e8 latte vs. latte macchiato==\n[[File:Latte macchiato with coffee beans.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A glass of latte macchiato]]\nA caff\u00e8 latte differs from a [[latte macchiato]]. In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caff\u00e8 lattes have a stronger coffee flavour.\n\nThe latte macchiato is milk steamed to [[microfoam]], served in a glass with a half shot of [[espresso]] poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a \"macchia\"\u2014a spot\u2014of espresso on the top. As with a [[caff\u00e8 macchiato]], which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there is a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk.\n\nThe use of the term 'macchiato' has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (such as Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. The word \"macchiato\" itself is Italian for \"stained\" which refers to creating a coffee or milk \"stain\" in the drink.\n\nAlthough the term macchiato has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a caff\u00e8 macchiato is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A caff\u00e8 macchiato is about {{convert|60|-|90|mL|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is usually served in a demi tasse. Although a traditional macchiato is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. The only difference between pouring latte art and macchiato art is that for a macchiato, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream.\n\n==Serving styles==\n[[File:Matcha Latte KF.JPG|thumb|A cup of latte made with matcha, called green tea latte. Popular variation of latte found in Asian countries.]]\n*In some establishments, lattes are served in a glass on a saucer with a napkin to hold the (sometimes hot) glass.\n*A latte is sometimes served in a bowl; in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, this is referred to as a [[caf\u00e9 au lait]].\n*Increasingly common in the United States and Europe, [[latte art]] has led to the stylization of coffee making, and the creation of which is now a popular art form. Created by pouring steaming, and mostly frothed, milk into the coffee, that liquid is introduced into the beverage in such a way that patterns are distinguishable on the top of coffee. Popular patterns can include hearts, flowers, trees and other forms of simplistic representations of images and objects.\n*Iced latte is often served unstirred so that coffee appears to \"float\" on top of white milk in a glass cup.\n*A variation of the iced latte, known as the \"bootleg latte\", \"ghetto latte\", or \"poor man's latte\",<ref>Charles Leroux. 2006.

In France, ''caf\u00e9 latte'' is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caff\u00e8 latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \"latte\" is in French called ''grand cr\u00e8me'' and in German ''Milchkaffee'' or (in Austria) ''[[Wiener Melange]]''.\n\nVariants include the chocolate-flavored [[Caff\u00e8 mocha|mocha]] or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as [[masala chai]] (spiced Indian tea), [[Mate (drink)|mate]], [[matcha]], [[turmeric]] or [[rooibos]]; other types of milk, such as [[soy milk]] or [[almond milk]], are also used.\n\n==Origin and history==\n[[File:Latte at Doppio Ristretto Chiang Mai 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Latte art]]]]\nCoffee and milk have been part of [[European cuisine]] since the 17th century. ''Caff\u00e8 e latte'', ''Milchkaffee'', ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' and ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public caf\u00e9s in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although ''Kapuziner'' is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in [[Vienna]] and [[Trieste]] in the 2nd half of 1700s as \"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\" (being the origin of the Italian [[cappuccino]]).\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term ''caff\u00e8 e latte'' was first used in English in 1867 by [[William Dean Howells]] in his essay \"Italian Journeys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00333261?query_type=word&queryword=latte&first=1&max_to_show=10&single=1&sort_type=alpha|title=Latte|edition=new online|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Kenneth Davids maintains that \"...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caff\u00e8 version of this drink is an American invention\".<ref name=\"Davids2001\">{{cite book|last=Davids|first=Kenneth|title=Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying, Fifth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqJsIcYOPcQC&pg=PA153|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2001-05-04|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-24665-5|pages=153\u2013}}</ref>{{dubious|date=October 2018}} The [[French language|French]] term ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' was used in caf\u00e9s in several countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French themselves started using the term ''caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me'' for coffee with milk or cream.\n\nThe [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian empire]] (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee houses, while in German homes it was still called ''Milchkaffee''. The Italians used the term ''caff\u00e8 latte'' domestically, but it is not known from caf\u00e9s like ''Florian'' in [[Venice]] or any other coffee houses or places where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WW2 both in Italy, and in cities like Vienna and London, ''[[espresso]]'' and ''cappuccino'' are the terms, ''latte'' is missing on coffee menus.\n\nIn Italian ''latte'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8latte|pron}}) means \"[[milk]]\"\u2014so ordering a \"latte\" in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.<ref>{{cite book|title=Espresso coffee|author-link=David Schomer|first=David|last=Schomer|edition=second|page=151|isbn=1-59404-031-1}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msadventuresinitaly.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-order-an-italian-coffee-in-italy/|title=Coffee traditions in Italy|publisher=Ms adventures in Italy|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Spanish the phrase ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' (coffee with milk) is used, which is by default served in a medium or large cup whereas the similar ''cortado'' (coffee with less milk) is served in a small cup.\n\nIn English-speaking countries ''latte'' is shorthand for ''caffelatte'' or ''caffellatte'' (from ''caff\u00e8 e latte'', \"coffee and milk\"), which is similar to the French ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'', the Spanish ''[[caf\u00e9 con leche]]'', the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''caf\u00e8 amb llet'' or the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''[[gal\u00e3o]].''\n\nThe [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]] claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, \"invented\" and \"made the latte a standard drink\" in the 1950s.

''Caff\u00e8 latte'' started replacing this term around 1996\u201397, but both names exist side by side, more often more similar than different in preparation.\n\n==Spelling variations==\nCoffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is ''caffellatte'' (the standard form; ''caffelatte'' is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from ''caff\u00e8 latte'' (with a [[grave accent]] over the e), while French is ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' (with an [[acute accent]]); Spanish is ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' and Portuguese is ''caf\u00e9 com leite''. Variants such as ''caf\u00e9 latte'', ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9'' and ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e8'' are commonly seen in English. A slang name for a caff\u00e8 latte is a 'lartay', although this spelling is considered informal and, in many places, impolite and disrespectful to Italian culture.\n\n==Current use==\n[[File:Caffe-Latte-Prague.JPG|thumb|Caff\u00e8 latte with latte art]]\nIn Italy, caff\u00e8 latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop [[moka pot]] and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the 'international' latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is generally not foamed, and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all).\n\nOutside Italy, a caff\u00e8 latte is typically prepared in a {{convert|240|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on}} glass or cup with one standard shot of [[espresso]] (either single, {{convert|30|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, or double, {{convert|60|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick on the top. In the US, a latte is often heavily sweetened, with 3% or even more sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/caffe-latte|title=Caff\u00e8 Latte|work=starbucks.com}}</ref>\n[[File:A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach,Australia.jpeg|thumb|A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach, Australia]]\nThe drink is related to a [[cappuccino]], the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a {{convert|20|mm}} thick layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand similar to the latte is the [[flat white]], which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk. In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino.\n\n==Iced latte==\nIn the United States, an iced latte is usually espresso and chilled milk poured over ice.<ref name=starbucksicedlatte>{{cite web|title=Iced Caff\u00e8 Latte|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/iced-caffe-latte?foodZone=9999|work=Starbucks.com|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> Unlike a hot latte, it does not usually contain steamed milk or foam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coffee Cafe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gwestJTfT8C&lpg=PA83&pg=PA83#v=onepage&f=false|first=Sherri|last=Johns|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84537-037-4}}</ref> Iced lattes almost always have sugar or flavoring syrups added, and are sometimes served blended with the ice.<ref name=Laskin>{{cite book|last=Laskin|first=Avner|title=Coffee: More Than 65 Delicious & Healthy Recipes|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4027-4937-7|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TB_Xu-SkJXQC&lpg=PA4&pg=PA46#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref> The espresso can be pre-chilled (sometimes as a mixture of espresso and milk) or frozen in advance to avoid warming up the drink.<ref name=moore>{{cite book|pages=144\u2013145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbLa7xGXxeIC&lpg=PA144&pg=PA144#v=onepage&f=false|last=Moore|first=Victoria|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date=Apr 22, 2010|isbn=978-0-7407-9845-0|title=How to Drink}}</ref>\n\n==Caff\u00e8 latte vs. latte macchiato==\n[[File:Latte macchiato with coffee beans.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A glass of latte macchiato]]\nA caff\u00e8 latte differs from a [[latte macchiato]]. In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caff\u00e8 lattes have a stronger coffee flavour.\n\nThe latte macchiato is milk steamed to [[microfoam]], served in a glass with a half shot of [[espresso]] poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a \"macchia\"\u2014a spot\u2014of espresso on the top. As with a [[caff\u00e8 macchiato]], which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there is a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk.\n\nThe use of the term 'macchiato' has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (such as Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. The word \"macchiato\" itself is Italian for \"stained\" which refers to creating a coffee or milk \"stain\" in the drink.\n\nAlthough the term macchiato has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a caff\u00e8 macchiato is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A caff\u00e8 macchiato is about {{convert|60|-|90|mL|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is usually served in a demi tasse. Although a traditional macchiato is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. The only difference between pouring latte art and macchiato art is that for a macchiato, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream.\n\n==Serving styles==\n[[File:Matcha Latte KF.JPG|thumb|A cup of latte made with matcha, called green tea latte. Popular variation of latte found in Asian countries.]]\n*In some establishments, lattes are served in a glass on a saucer with a napkin to hold the (sometimes hot) glass.\n*A latte is sometimes served in a bowl; in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, this is referred to as a [[caf\u00e9 au lait]].\n*Increasingly common in the United States and Europe, [[latte art]] has led to the stylization of coffee making, and the creation of which is now a popular art form. Created by pouring steaming, and mostly frothed, milk into the coffee, that liquid is introduced into the beverage in such a way that patterns are distinguishable on the top of coffee. Popular patterns can include hearts, flowers, trees and other forms of simplistic representations of images and objects.\n*Iced latte is often served unstirred so that coffee appears to \"float\" on top of white milk in a glass cup.\n*A variation of the iced latte, known as the \"bootleg latte\", \"ghetto latte\", or \"poor man's latte\",<ref>Charles Leroux. 2006.
