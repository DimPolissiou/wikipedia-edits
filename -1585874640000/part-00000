The dynasty provided four [[List of German Kings and Emperors#Kings|German Kings]] (1024\u20131125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1027\u20131125); as such, the term ''Salic dynasty'' is also used to refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the time as a separate term.\n\nAfter the death of the last [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] of the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] in 1024, the [[Elective monarchy|elective]] titles of [[King of the Germans]] and then three years later Holy Roman Emperor both passed to the first monarch of the Salian dynasty in the person of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], the only son of [[Henry of Speyer|Count Henry of Speyer]] and [[Adelheid of Alsace]] (both territories in the Franconia of the day). He was elected German King in 1024 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 26 March 1027.\n\nThe four Salian kings of the dynasty\u2014[[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]\u2014ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 to 1125 and firmly established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.\n\n==Origins and name==\n\n[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen.]]\n\nModern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the [[Widonids]], a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th&nbsp;century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers [[Moselle]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] and they supported the [[Carolingians]]. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river [[Rhine]] started after they founded [[Hornbach Abbey]] in the [[Bliesgau]] around 750. Hornbach remained their [[proprietary church|proprietary monastery]] and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the [[Wormsgau]]. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto]] descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in [[Duchy of Franconia|Rhenish Franconia]]. {{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n[[Wipo of Burgundy]], the biographer of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], described Conrad's father and uncle as \"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely [[etimology]] links the appelation to the old German world ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139\u201340, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appelation have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}\n\nAll male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]].

He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad&nbsp;I of Germany. This marriage alliance with the [[Conradines]] introduced Conrad as a [[leading name]] in his family.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=9}}\n\n===Conrad the Red===\n{{Main|Conrad the Red}}\n\nWerner's son, Conrad the Red, inherited his father Franconian estates. His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I of Germany]] crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto&nbsp;I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the [[Duchy of Lotharingia]] in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Luidgard]], in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal [[Ottonian dynasty]] and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lech]] in 955. The contemporaneous [[Widukind of Corvey]] praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the [[Worms Cathedral]], although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=6, 9}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 361 (note 22)}}\n\n===Otto of Worms===\n{{Main|Otto I, Duke of Carinthia}}\n\nConrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal granfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto&nbsp;I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the [[Nahegau]] in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, [[Niddagau]], [[Elsenzgau]], [[Kraichgau]] and [[Pfinzgau]], thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and [[Neckar]] by the time Otto&nbsp;I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]], to Count Henry of Arlon, or to [[Burkhard, Margrave of Austria|Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches]]. Otto&nbsp;I's son and successor, Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], was obviously worried aboukt the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona]] in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town to the [[Bishop of Worms|local bishop]]. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in [[Wasgau]], the royal palace at [[Kaiserslautern]] and the properiatery rights over [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|Weissenburg Abbey]]. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry of Bavaria]] in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=11, 14, 184, 190 (notes 10 and 12)}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18\u201319, 23, 361 (note 20)}}\n\n==Dukes and bishops==\n\n{{chart top|Salian dukes and bishops}}\n{{Tree chart/start|align=center}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | |SEE1|SEE1=''[[#Early Salians|Early Salians]]''|boxstyle_SEE1=background-color:#F5FAFF}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | |Q|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | |!|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | |OTT|~|y|~|JUD|OTT=[[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]]<br>\u20201004<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|978|985|1002|1004}})|JUD=Judith<br>\u2020991|boxstyle_OTT=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{Tree chart|ADE|~|y|~|HEN| | |GRE| | |MAT|~|y|~|CON1| | |WIL|ADE=Adelaide of Metz<br>\u20201039/1046|HEN=[[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]]<br>\u2020990/991 (?)|GRE=[[Pope Gregory V]]<br>*972 \u2020999<br>({{reign|996|999}})|MAT=[[Matilda of Swabia]]<br>\u20201031/32|CON1=[[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I]]<br>\u20201011<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|1004|1011}})|WIL=[[William I (bishop of Strasbourg)|William]]<br>\u20201046/47<br>B. of Strasbourg<br>({{reign|1028/29|1046/47}})|boxstyle_HEN=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_GRE=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_CON1=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_WIL=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | |Q| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | |SEE2| | | | | | | | | | |CON2| | | |BRU|SEE2=''[[#Imperial Salians|Imperial Salians]]''|CON2=[[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad II]]<br>*1002\u201305 \u20201039<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|1036|1039}})|BRU=[[Bruno (bishop of W\u00fcrzburg)|Bruno]]<br>\u20201045<br>B. of W\u00fcrzburg<br>({{reign|1034|1045}})|boxstyle_SEE2=background-color:#F5FAFF|boxstyle_CON2=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_BRU=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n===Henry of Worms===\n\n{{Main|Henry of Speyer}}\n\nHenry was Otto of Worms's eldest son.

Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.\n\nAlready in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052\u20131055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.\n[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]\nThe early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.\n\nThe monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.\n\nAccording to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.\n\nThe first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Salian Kings and Emperors==\n{{Salian dynasty}}\n* [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] 1024\u20131039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027\n* [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] 1039\u20131056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046\n* [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] 1056\u20131106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084\n** [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad (III)]] 1087\u20131098, nominal king under his father Henry IV\n* [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] 1106\u20131125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111\n\nTheir regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concordat of Worms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{loc}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Schutz|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Schutz|year=2010|title=The Medieval Empire in Central Europe: Dynastyc Continuity in the Post-Carolingian Frankish Realm, 900-1300|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-1966-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Weinfurter|first=Stefan|orig-year=1992|year=1999|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|translator-last=Kaiser|translator-first=Denise A.|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Herwig|authorlink=Herwig Wolfram|orig-year=2000|year=2006|title=Conrad II, 990\u20131039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms|translator-last=Bowlus|translator-first=Barbara M.|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=0-271-02738-X|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Lenelotte M\u00f6ller, Hans Ammerich: Die Salier. 1024-1125.

The dynasty provided four [[List of German Kings and Emperors#Kings|German Kings]] (1024\u20131125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1027\u20131125); as such, the term ''Salic dynasty'' is also used to refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the time as a separate term.\n\nAfter the death of the last [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] of the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] in 1024, the [[Elective monarchy|elective]] titles of [[King of the Germans]] and then three years later Holy Roman Emperor both passed to the first monarch of the Salian dynasty in the person of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], the only son of [[Henry of Speyer|Count Henry of Speyer]] and [[Adelheid of Alsace]] (both territories in the Franconia of the day). He was elected German King in 1024 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 26 March 1027.\n\nThe four Salian kings of the dynasty\u2014[[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]\u2014ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 to 1125 and firmly established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.\n\n==Origins and name==\n\n[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen.]]\n\nModern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the [[Widonids]], a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th&nbsp;century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers [[Moselle]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] and they supported the [[Carolingians]]. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river [[Rhine]] started after they founded [[Hornbach Abbey]] in the [[Bliesgau]] around 750. Hornbach remained their [[proprietary church|proprietary monastery]] and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the [[Wormsgau]]. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto]] descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in [[Duchy of Franconia|Rhenish Franconia]]. {{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n[[Wipo of Burgundy]], the biographer of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], described Conrad's father and uncle as \"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely [[etimology]] links the appelation to the old German world ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139\u201340, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appelation have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}\n\nAll male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]].

The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto&nbsp;I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the [[Duchy of Lotharingia]] in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Luidgard]], in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal [[Ottonian dynasty]] and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lech]] in 955. The contemporaneous [[Widukind of Corvey]] praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the [[Worms Cathedral]], although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=6, 9}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 361 (note 22)}}\n\n===Otto of Worms===\n{{Main|Otto I, Duke of Carinthia}}\n\nConrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal granfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto&nbsp;I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the [[Nahegau]] in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, [[Niddagau]], [[Elsenzgau]], [[Kraichgau]] and [[Pfinzgau]], thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and [[Neckar]] by the time Otto&nbsp;I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]], to Count Henry of Arlon, or to [[Burkhard, Margrave of Austria|Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches]]. Otto&nbsp;I's son and successor, Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], was obviously worried aboukt the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona]] in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town to the [[Bishop of Worms|local bishop]]. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in [[Wasgau]], the royal palace at [[Kaiserslautern]] and the properiatery rights over [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|Weissenburg Abbey]]. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry of Bavaria]] in 1002.

Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.\n\nAlready in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052\u20131055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.\n[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]\nThe early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.\n\nThe monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.\n\nAccording to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.\n\nThe first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Salian Kings and Emperors==\n{{Salian dynasty}}\n* [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] 1024\u20131039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027\n* [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] 1039\u20131056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046\n* [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] 1056\u20131106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084\n** [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad (III)]] 1087\u20131098, nominal king under his father Henry IV\n* [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] 1106\u20131125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111\n\nTheir regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concordat of Worms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{loc}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Schutz|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Schutz|year=2010|title=The Medieval Empire in Central Europe: Dynastyc Continuity in the Post-Carolingian Frankish Realm, 900-1300|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-1966-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Weinfurter|first=Stefan|orig-year=1992|year=1999|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|translator-last=Kaiser|translator-first=Denise A.|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Herwig|authorlink=Herwig Wolfram|orig-year=2000|year=2006|title=Conrad II, 990\u20131039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms|translator-last=Bowlus|translator-first=Barbara M.|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=0-271-02738-X|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Lenelotte M\u00f6ller, Hans Ammerich: Die Salier. 1024-1125.

Letters ''a'' and ''b'' '''alternate''' in ''w'' if after removing from ''w'' all letters but the copies of ''a'' and ''b'' we either obtain a word ''abab''... or a word ''baba''.... In this context, we say that [[W|''w'']] is ''G''<nowiki/>'s '''word-representant''', or that ''w'' '''represents''' ''G''. For example, the [[cycle graph]] labeled by ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''s'' in clock-wise direction is word-representable because it can be represented by ''szxsyxzy''. The smallest (by the number of&nbsp; vertices) non-word-representable graph is the [[wheel graph]] ''W''<sub>5</sub>, which is the only non-word-representable graph on 6 vertices.\n\nThe definition of a word-representable graph works both in labelled and unlabelled cases since any labelling of a graph is equivalent to any other labelling. Also, the class of word-representable graphs is [[Hereditary property|hereditary]].

These fields are [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], [[computer science]], [[combinatorics on words]], and [[scheduling]]. Word-representable graphs are especially important in graph theory, since they generalise several important classes of graphs, e.g. [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]].\n\n==Early results==\n\nIt was shown in <ref name=\"KP08\" /> that a graph ''G'' is word-representable iff it is '''k-representable''' for some ''k'', that is, ''G'' can be represented by a word having ''k'' copies of each letter. Moreover, if a graph is ''k''-representable then it is also (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-representable. Thus, the notion of the '''representation number of a graph''', as the ''minimum'' ''k'' such that a graph is word-representable, is well-defined. Non-word-representable graphs have the representation number \u221e. Graphs with representation number 1 are precisely the set of [[Complete graph|complete graphs]], while graphs with representation number 2 are precisely the class of [[Circle graph|circle]] non-complete graphs. In particular, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Forest.html forests] (except for single [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] on at most 2 vertices), [[Ladder graph|ladder graphs]] and [[Cycle graph|cycle graphs]] have representation number 2. No classification for graphs with representation number 3 is known. However, there are examples of such graphs, e.g. [[Petersen graph|Petersen's graph]] and [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrismGraph.html prisms]. Moreover, 3-[[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of any graph is 3-representable. In particular, for every graph ''G'' there exists a 3-representable graph ''H'' that contains ''G'' as a [[Graph<ref name=\"KP08\" />. \n\nA graph ''G'' is '''permutationally representable''' if it can be represented by a word of the form ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>...''p<sub>k</sub>'', where ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is a [[permutation]]. On can also say that ''G'' is '''permutationally ''k''-representable'''. A graph is permutationally representable iff it is a [[Comparability graph|comparability graph]] <ref name=\"KS08\" />. A graph is word-representable implies that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is permutationally representable (i.e. is a [[comparability graph]]) <ref name=\"KS08\" />. Converse to the last statement is not true <ref name=\":0\" />. However, the fact that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is a [[comparability graph]] implies that the [[Clique problem|Maximum Clique problem]] is polynomially solvable on word-representable graphs <ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. \n\n==Semi-transitive orientations==\n\nSemi-transitive orientations provide a powerful tool to study word-representable graphs. A directed graph is '''semi-transitively oriented''' iff it is http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AcyclicGraph.html acyclic] and for any directed path ''u''<sub>1</sub>\u2192''u''<sub>2</sub>\u2192 ...\u2192''u<sub>t</sub>'', ''t'' \u2265 2, either there is no edge from ''u''<sub>1</sub> to ''u<sub>t</sub>'' or all edges ''u<sub>i</sub>'' \u2192 ''u<sub>j</sub>'' exist for 1 \u2264 ''i'' < ''j'' \u2264 ''t''. A key theorem in the theory of word-representable graphs states that a graph is word-representable iff it admits a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As a corollary to the proof of the key theorem one obtain an upper bound on word-representants: Each non-complete word-representable graph ''G'' is 2(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03ba''(''G''))-representable, where ''\u03ba''(''G'') is the size of a maximal clique in ''G'' <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As an immediate corollary of the last statement, one has that the [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Recognition_problem recognition problem] of word-representability is in [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. In 2014, [http://fc.isima.fr/~limouzy/ Vincent Limouzy] observed that it is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete problem]] to recognise whether a given graph is word-representable <ref name=\"KL15\" /> <ref name=\":2\" />. Another important corollary to the key theorem is that any [[Graph coloring|3-colorable<sub>2''n''+1</sub>, for ''n'' \u2265 2, are not word-representable and ''W''<sub>5</sub> is the minimum (by the number of vertices) non-word-representable graph. Taking any non-comparability graph and adding an apex (a vertex connected to any other vertex), we obtain a non-word-representable graph, which then can produce infinitely many non-word-representable graphs <ref name=\"KL15\" />. Any graph produced in this way will necessarily have a triangle (a cycle of length 3), and a vertex of degree at least 5. Non-word-representable graphs of maximum degree 4 exist <ref>[[arxiv:1307.1810|A. Collins, S. Kitaev, and V. Lozin. New results on word-representable graphs, Discr. Appl.

In particular, <ref name=\"KLMW2017\" /> offers a characterisation in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs of word-representable split graphs in which vertices in the independent set are of degree at most 2, or the size of the clique is 4, while a computational characterisation of word-representable split graphs with the clique of size 5 is given in <ref name=\"CKS2019\" />. Also, necessary and sufficient conditions for an orientation of a split graph to be semi-transitive are given in <ref name=\"KLMW2017\" />, while in <ref name=\"CKS2019\" /> [[Threshold graph|threshold graphs]] are shown to be word-representable and the split graphs are used to show that gluing two word-representable graphs in any clique of size at least 2 may, or may not result in a word-representable graph, which solved a long-standing open problem.\n\n===Graphs representable by pattern avoiding words===\n\nA graph is '''''p''-representable''' if it can be represented by a word avoiding a [[Permutation pattern|pattern]] ''p''. For example, 132-representable graphs are those that can be represented by words ''w''<sub>1</sub>w<sub>2</sub>...''w<sub>n</sub>'' where there are no 1 \u2264 ''a'' < ''b'' < ''c'' \u2264 ''n'' such that ''w<sub>a</sub>'' < ''w<sub>c</sub>'' < ''w<sub>b</sub>''.

That is, we can say that if there are up to ''k'' occurrence of ''p'' formed by letters ''a'' and ''b'', then there is an edge between ''a'' and ''b''. This gives the notion of a ''k''-''p''-representable graph, and ''k''-11-representable graphs are studied in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\">[[arxiv:1803.01055|G.-S. Cheon, J. Kim, M. Kim, and A. Pyatkin.

Whether or not any graph is 1-11-representable is a challenging open problem.\n\nFor yet another type of relevant generalisation, [[Hans Zantema]] suggested the notion of a '''''k''-semi-transitive orientation''' refining the notion of a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"AGKZ2019\" />.

Also, the class of word-representable graphs is [[Hereditary property|hereditary]]. Word-representable graphs generalise several important classes of graphs such as [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]].

These fields are [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], [[computer science]], [[combinatorics on words]], and [[scheduling]]. Word-representable graphs are especially important in graph theory, since they generalise several important classes of graphs, e.g. [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]].\n\n==Early results==\n\nIt was shown in <ref name=\"KP08\" /> that a graph ''G'' is word-representable iff it is '''k-representable''' for some ''k'', that is, ''G'' can be represented by a word having ''k'' copies of each letter. Moreover, if a graph is ''k''-representable then it is also (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-representable. Thus, the notion of the '''representation number of a graph''', as the ''minimum'' ''k'' such that a graph is word-representable, is well-defined. Non-word-representable graphs have the representation number \u221e. Graphs with representation number 1 are precisely the set of [[Complete graph|complete graphs]], while graphs with representation number 2 are precisely the class of [[Circle graph|circle]] non-complete graphs. In particular, [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Forest.html forests] (except for single [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] on at most 2 vertices), [[Ladder graph|ladder graphs]] and [[Cycle graph|cycle graphs]] have representation number 2. No classification for graphs with representation number 3 is known. However, there are examples of such graphs, e.g. [[Petersen graph|Petersen's graph]] and [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrismGraph.html prisms]. Moreover, 3-[[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of any graph is 3-representable. In particular, for every graph ''G'' there exists a 3-representable graph ''H'' that contains ''G'' as a [[Graph minor|minor]] <ref name=\"KP08\" />. \n\nA graph ''G'' is '''permutationally representable''' if it can be represented by a word of the form ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>...''p<sub>k</sub>'', where ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is a [[permutation]]. On can also say that ''G'' is '''permutationally ''k''-representable'''. A graph is permutationally representable iff it is a [[Comparability graph|comparability graph]] <ref name=\"KS08\" />. A graph is word-representable implies that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is permutationally representable (i.e. is a [[comparability graph]]) <ref name=\"KS08\" />. Converse to the last statement is not true <ref name=\":0\" />. However, the fact that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is a [[comparability graph]] implies that the [[Clique problem|Maximum Clique problem]] is polynomially solvable on word-representable graphs <ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. \n\n==Semi-transitive orientations==\n\nSemi-transitive orientations provide a powerful tool to study word-representable graphs. A directed graph is '''semi-transitively oriented''' iff it is [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AcyclicGraph.html acyclic] and for any directed path ''u''<sub>1</sub>\u2192''u''<sub>2</sub>\u2192 ...\u2192''u<sub>t</sub>'', ''t'' \u2265 2, either there is no edge from ''u''<sub>1</sub> to ''u<sub>t</sub>'' or all edges ''u<sub>i</sub>'' \u2192 ''u<sub>j</sub>'' exist for 1 \u2264 ''i'' < ''j'' \u2264 ''t''. A key theorem in the theory of word-representable graphs states that a graph is word-representable iff it admits a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As a corollary to the proof of the key theorem one obtain an upper bound on word-representants: Each non-complete word-representable graph ''G'' is 2(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03ba''(''G''))-representable, where ''\u03ba''(''G'') is the size of a maximal clique in ''G'' <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As an immediate corollary of the last statement, one has that the [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Recognition_problem recognition problem] of word-representability is in [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. In 2014, [http://fc.isima.fr/~limouzy/ Vincent Limouzy] observed that it is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete problem]] to recognise whether a given graph is word-representable <ref name=\"KL15\" /> <ref name=\":2\" />. Another important corollary to the key theorem is that any [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graph]] is word-representable. The last fact implies that many classical graph problems are NP-hard on word-representable graphs. \u00a0 \n\n==Overview of selected results==\n\n===Non-word-representable graphs===\n\n[[Wheel graph|Wheel graphs]] ''W''<sub>2''n''+1</sub>, for ''n'' \u2265 2, are not word-representable and ''W''<sub>5</sub> is the minimum (by the number of vertices) non-word-representable graph. Taking any non-comparability graph and adding an apex (a vertex connected to any other vertex), we obtain a non-word-representable graph, which then can produce infinitely many non-word-representable graphs <ref name=\"KL15\" />. Any graph produced in this way will necessarily have a triangle (a cycle of length 3), and a vertex of degree at least 5. Non-word-representable graphs of maximum degree 4 exist <ref>[[arxiv:1307.1810|A. Collins, S. Kitaev, and V. Lozin. New results on word-representable graphs, Discr. Appl.

Also, necessary and sufficient conditions for an orientation of a split graph to be semi-transitive are given in <ref name=\"KLMW2017\" />, while in <ref name=\"CKS2019\" /> [[Threshold graph|threshold graphs]] are shown to be word-representable and the split graphs are used to show that gluing two word-representable graphs in any clique of size at least 2 may, or may not result in a word-representable graph, which solved a long-standing open problem.\n\n===Graphs representable by pattern avoiding words===\n\nA graph is '''''p''-representable''' if it can be represented by a word avoiding a [[Permutation pattern|pattern]] ''p''. For example, 132-representable graphs are those that can be represented by words ''w''<sub>1</sub>w<sub>2</sub>...''w<sub>n</sub>'' where there are no 1 \u2264 ''a'' < ''b'' < ''c'' \u2264 ''n'' such that ''w<sub>a</sub>'' < ''w<sub>c</sub>'' < ''w<sub>b</sub>''.

Enumeration and Extensions of Word-representants, arXiv:1909.00019.]]</ref> of the notion of a word-representable graph are based on the observation by [https://www.math.ucsd.edu/memorials/jeffrey-remmel/ Jeff Remmel] that non-edges are defined by occurrences of the pattern 11 (two consecutive equal letters) in a word representing a graph, while edges are defined by avoidance of this pattern. For example, instead of the pattern 11, one can use the pattern 112, or the pattern, 1212, or any other binary pattern where the assumption that the alphabet is ordered can be made so that a letter in a word corresponding to 1 in the pattern is less than that corresponding to 2 in the pattern. Letting ''u'' be an ordered binary pattern we thus get the notion of a '''''u''-representable graph'''. So, word-representable graphs are just the class of 11-representable graphs. Intriguingly, '''any graph''' can be ''u''-represented assuming ''u'' is of length at least 3 <ref name=\"K2017\">[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgt.22097 S. Kitaev.

That is, we can say that if there are up to ''k'' occurrence of ''p'' formed by letters ''a'' and ''b'', then there is an edge between ''a'' and ''b''. This gives the notion of a ''k''-''p''-representable graph, and ''k''-11-representable graphs are studied in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\">[[arxiv:1803.01055|G.-S. Cheon, J. Kim, M. Kim, and A. Pyatkin.

The key results in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\" /> are that '''any''' graph is 2-11-representable and that word-representable graphs are a proper subclass of 1-11-representable graphs. Whether or not any graph is 1-11-representable is a challenging open problem.\n\nFor yet another type of relevant generalisation, [[Hans Zantema]] suggested the notion of a '''''k''-semi-transitive orientation''' refining the notion of a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"AGKZ2019\" />.

She is a [[cardiologist]] at the eponymous hospital, and [[widow]] of physician [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]). The role was originated by Patsy Rahn in 1976, who played the role until [[showrunner]]s replaced her with Charleson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> Charleson's tenure with the [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] is [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|one of the longest in American soap operas]].\n\n==Character and casting==\nMonica becomes [[Chief Physician|Chief of Staff]] at General Hospital following the death of her husband, [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]]. Her specialty is [[cardiology]]. Her various affairs, primarily with fellow doctors [[Jeff Webber]] and his older brother [[Rick Webber]], and her quarrels with husband and their dysfunctional family were all major stories on the show throughout the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn her time on the show, Monica has battled [[breast cancer]], and dealt with outliving almost all of her children. Her two remaining children are Jason Morgan and Skye Quartermaine. She is the owner of the [[Quartermaine]] mansion, as she often reminds her family when they begin quarreling. She has been known to throw them out of her house.\n\nIn 2006, she only had rare appearances. New storylines developed in 2007 (an investigation into the murder of Rick Webber, the deaths of her husband and daughter [[Emily Quartermaine]]), and she is being featured more prominently.\n\nWith the returns of [[Denise Alexander]] ([[Lesley Webber]]), [[Genie Francis]] ([[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]]), and [[Kin Shriner]] ([[Scott Baldwin]]), Monica remains the fourth oldest character on ''General Hospital''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|title=General Hospital 1976|date=January 1, 1976|work=[[ABC Daytime]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=[[New York City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326104340/http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hvROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6987%2C5357067|title=Frank Plans To Divorce Nancy; Mac Moves Back With Rachel|date=February 21, 1977|department=The Soaps|first=Lynda|last=Hirsch|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/features/9303190826_1_leslie-charleson-soap-gloria-monty|title=Seeing 'General Hospital' Through Good Times And Ill|date=March 10, 1993|first=Marla|last=Hart|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> and Charleson is the show's most tenured performer.<ref name=\"Monica Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |title=Character Monica Quartermaine Biography |publisher=[[ABC Daytime]] |work=[[General Hospital]] |location=United States |accessdate=July 10, 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919003854/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0825-charleson.php|title=Leslie Charleson dropped to recurring status|website=[[SoapCentral]]|location=United States|publisher=Soap Central Live|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Charleson off contract\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Fairman|title=Leslie Charleson taken off contract at GH!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/leslie-charleson-taken-off-contract-at-gh/2010/08/24/|website=[[Michael Fairman TV]]|publisher=The Michael Fairman Company|location=United States|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, newly appointed head writer [[Garin Wolf]] expressed his interest in having Charleson appear on a much more frequent basis.

However, Greg, Gail's husband took advantage of Monica and raped her. Gail remained unaware of this for many years but the two were able to reconcile once the truth came out. Monica was able to use her experience with Greg to help [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]] when she was raped.\n\nMonica later had an affair with David Langston and gave birth to a daughter, Dawn, whom she gave up for adoption.\n\nJust prior to her arrival on GH, Monica had been engaged to [[Rick Webber]]. However, he had broken up with her and flew off to [[Africa]] where he became caught up in a [[civil war]] and was presumed dead. Monica turned to [[Jeff Webber]], Rick's brother, for comfort and married him, not knowing that Rick was still alive.\n\n===1970s===\nMonica arrived in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] in 1976, having recently married [[Jeff Webber]]. [[Steve Hardy]], who had been recently appointed as Chief of Staff at [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)#General Hospital|General Hospital]], invited the couple to take part in his ''Mr. and Mrs. Intern Programme'', believing that the couple had an idyllic marriage. However, the truth was that Monica had only married Jeff on the rebound. She was still deeply in love with Jeff's brother, Rick, who had been presumed dead in Africa. Thus, the marriage collapsed when Rick was revealed to be still alive and Monica cheated on Jeff with Rick, while Jeff cheated on Monica with [[Heather Grant]], with whom he had a son, [[Steven Webber]]. Jeff and Monica divorced in 1977.\n\nThroughout this time, Rick had grown close to [[Lesley Webber|Lesley Faulkner]] and planned to marry her. Monica was devastated, and tried to put a stop to it, blackmailing Lesley into turning down Rick's proposal. If Lesley didn't, Monica would tell the hospital board of Monica's affair with Rick, denying him the opportunity to become Chief of Cardiology at General Hospital. During the argument, a pregnant Lesley fell down the stairs and miscarried. Lesley was despondent, and called off her engagement to Rick, hoping to save Rick's career. Meanwhile, Monica and Rick talk about how important the promotion is to Rick, and Monica realizes she cannot go through with her threat, but doesn't tell Lesley as much. Monica's found out when Lesley's daughter Laura's tape recorder is found to have caught Monica's threats to Lesley. Lesley and Rick are married in October 1977.\n\nRick and Monica's relationship becomes embittered, and Monica nearly loses her job, though Lesley sets aside her personal feelings and vouches for Monica's talents as a doctor to Steve, saving her job. Monica claims to be moving on, but she and Rick are forced to work together with [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] on plans for a new wing at the hospital. Monica makes a last-ditch effort to bed Rick while trapped in a remote ranger station overnight during a storm while working on the project, but is turned down. While Monica continues to antagonize Lesley and Rick, she soon begins a relationship with Alan, though she's still very much attracted to Rick.\n\nMonica had doubts about her relationship with Alan, but these were soon overshadowed when Monica's foster mother Gail Adamson discovered that Monica had slept with Gail's late husband Greg. Gail did not believe Monica's explanation that Greg had forced her into the affair and cut ties with Monica. Monica turned to Alan for support and agreed to marry him. Eventually Gail and Monica made amends. She was thrilled when Gail found happiness by finally agreeing to marry [[Lee Baldwin]] after months of putting him off. Monica became a close confidante to Laura who found that Monica treated her like an adult while her mother continuously treated her like a child.\n\nAfter their 1978 wedding, Alan bought a mansion for Monica as a wedding present, and his family ended up re-settling in Port Charles as well. Monica adored Alan's parents, Edward (who ran the family empire, ELQ) and Lila, but his sister, Tracy, felt Monica was beneath them and caused problems every chance she got. Monica continued to be a confidante to Lesley's young daughter, Laura, and when nurse Bobbie Spencer began to harass Laura and blamed her for attacking her in the hospital book store, Monica took Laura's side, realizing the extent of her own harassment towards Lesley whom she made an effort to become friends with. However, within a year of her second marriage, Monica once again fell into Rick's arms and the two had a one-night stand. Monica was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Tracy, who had made efforts to get to know her sister-in-law whom she respected as a physician, suspected the truth and plotted to have the unborn child declared illegitimate so her son Ned would inherit the Quartermaine estate. For many months, Monica was bedridden, and innocent student nurse [[Amy Vining]] her only companion. Monica was unaware that the gossipy Amy was totally enamored of the handsome Alan who used her as a spy to keep an eye on his wife. Monica gave birth to a son, [[A. J. Quartermaine|A.J.]] during the middle of a winter storm with only Gail and Lesley present and screamed out that Rick was the father.\n\n===1980s===\nRick and Lesley divorced so Rick and Monica could be together. Alan was enraged by this turn of events and made several attempts to kill Rick and Monica, but was thwarted at every attempt. While both Scotty and Lee found Monica's actions repulsive, their wives Laura and Gail were more compassionate even though Laura was heartsick at seeing Lesley and her adoptive father separated. Monica managed to trick Alan into admitting on tape that he had tried to kill her and Rick and moved into Tracy's old apartment as she prepared to file for an uncontested divorce. Eventually, both Monica and Alan realized that A.J. was indeed Alan's son and not Rick's. Monica attempted to hide this fact from Rick, but Alan eventually exposed the truth that there were rare circumstances when two parents with type O blood could conceive a type B blood baby. Rick, disgusted with Monica's continued manipulations, left her and focused on the formation of the waterfront clinic. A confrontation with Lesley over the revelation of Alan Jr.'s paternity ended up with Monica viciously maligning Lesley's lack of passion and Lesley's surprising response of a hard slap across Monica's face. The next day when Monica went to get her final divorce decree, she discovered that Alan had contested it, and when she confronted him, he threatened her with the loss of her son for her actions, forcing her to return to him even though she couldn't stand the sight of him. Eventually, because of issues concerning Laura on the run, Rick went back to Lesley, having Monica removed as his assistant in surgery, although he later relented, citing their shared excellence in the operating room. Monica felt that she had no other alternative but to stay with Alan, biding her time to find a way out. The only good thing that happened for Monica around this time was Tracy's departure after discovering that her husband [[Mitch Williams]] was having an affair with sexy waitress [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]] who ended up being manager of the Campus Disco which Alan bought as a side investment after owner [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]] was sent to prison for mob activities.\n\nFollowing their 'reconciliation', Monica refused to sleep with Alan and insisted on separate rooms. Despite attempts by both to be civil to each other, Alan grew frustrated and in 1981, he embarked on an affair with Susan, who became pregnant and would give birth to Alan's son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] while out of town. Alan moved Susan into a cottage but continued to live in the Quartermaine mansion until the tensions became so great between him and Monica that he moved in with Susan. The only calm moments between Alan and Monica was their shared desire to prove that Alan's cousin, [[Alexandria Quartermaine]] was utilizing the family fortune in ways that would not keep their holdings strong. Monica was greatly amused when Alexandria's will left all of her ELQ stock to Lila, putting her in control and keeping Edward from making deals he felt important to gain more money and power. Monica hired private investigator Larry Corrigan ([[Frank Ashmore]]) to get proof of Alan's affair with Susan, and he took a job at the campus disco, managing it after Susan went to New York to have her baby. Between Larry and Cathy Summers (A.J.'s nanny), she got the evidence she needed and used it to make Alan's life a living hell. In spite of public scenes at the hospital which caused both of them to be reprimanded by Steve Hardy, Monica would continue to be seen with Alan at social functions, including Luke and Laura's wedding, even though she was preparing to file for divorce and sell the Quartermaine house, a move that Alan put a stop to. But the chemistry between Alan and Susan soon waned and he found himself becoming bored with her which lead to him unable to make love. Arguing with Monica over Susan and Jason led to them admitting their passion for one another, and Alan broke off with Susan who sued him for palimony and major child support. The final straw for Alan came when she turned into a drunk and married Scott Baldwin after being in a horrendous car accident. In 1983, Susan was murdered by Lila's first husband, Crane Tolliver (discovered after all of the Quartermaines, including Monica, were questioned as suspects), and Susan's aunt Alice Grant took Jason in. After Alice died of an embolism a few months later, Monica and Alan fought her daughter, Heather (the same Heather whom Jeff had cheated on Monica with seven years earlier) for custody of the baby. Monica was not pleased at having her husband's illegitimate offspring in the house at first, but eventually grew to love Jason as if he were her own. She later legally adopted him as well.\n\nMonica was saddened by the sudden death in a car accident of her old rival Lesley Webber whom she had somewhat made peace with. Only a few months before, the Quartermaines had shared in the Webber family's joy over Laura Spencer's return from the dead. While determined to make her marriage to Alan work this time around, Monica did become a source of comfort for her ex-lover, Rick, and even wished him much happiness when he married [[Ginny Blake]], the natural mother of Rick and Lesley's adopted son, Mikey. The Quartermaines had more than their share of tensions on their hand when Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt showed up and ended up with proof that Edward and Lila's marriage had not been legal. The following year, Jimmy Lee's mother, Beatrice LaSeur, showed up and proceeded to attempt to blackmail the family, leading to her apparent murder in which Monica was once again a suspect. But she had accidentally drank Lila's heart medication which caused her death. One of the suspects in Beatrice's death was spa owner [[Lorena Sharpe]] who turned out to be Monica's long-lost cousin. In 1986, Monica had an affair with [[Sean Donely]], and kicked all the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]s out of the mansion. Alan concocted a bizarre scheme to frame Sean for his 'murder' and even went missing for several months as part of the plan. Eventually, Sean left Monica for [[Tiffany Hill]], and Monica reluctantly reconciled with Alan and let the Quartermaines back into the mansion.\n\nMonica went away to a spa resort and ended up sleeping with one of the workers there, a young man named Ward. To Monica's surprise, Ward turned out to be [[List of past General Hospital characters#Ned Ashton|Ned Ashton]], the son of her sister-in-law, [[Tracy Quartermaine]] (who came back after a decade's absence) and thus, Alan's nephew. The two agreed to keep the affair a secret, but soon another secret of Monica's would come out. Monica's secret daughter, [[Dawn Winthrop]] turned up and began dating Ned. These two secrets proved at last to be the deathblow to Monica and Alan's marriage and the two divorced. Alan later married [[Lucy Coe]] in 1990. During this time, the family believed that Edward had been killed in a helicopter crash and fought brutally over his estate.\n\n===1990s===\nDawn was later murdered and Monica was devastated by her death. After Alan's marriage to Lucy also proved a disaster, Monica and Alan were drawn back together by their son A.J's rebellious behavior. In 1991, the two remarried and the next three years of their marriage were relatively calm, although the return of David Langton (Dawn's father), A.J.'s relationship with David's daughter Nikki and Alan's friendship with Rhonda Wexler did give the couple some cause for concern. It was during this time that Edward was found alive and returned to Port Charles to help the Quartermaine's take on the cartel who had tried to take over ELQ. Alan and Monica also welcomed Lee and Gail Baldwin back to Port Charles, getting Gail to provide some therapy for the problematic A.J. Monica supported Alan fully when he confessed to her that he had discovered that Ray Conway, Rhonda's boyfriend, had sexually molested Karen, and had pushed him after finding Ray beating up Rhonda, causing Ray to hit his head and die.\n\nMonica's life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Monica became despondent and began pushing Alan away, though Alan fought hard to give Monica the support she needed. During this time, Monica befriended [[Paige Bowen]], a fellow cancer patient. Monica was devastated when Paige died, but ended up adopting Paige's daughter, [[Emily Quartermaine|Emily]]. Finally, Monica went into remission, but she and Alan were drifting further and further apart.\n\nBy 1995, A.J.'s alcoholism, which had been developing for several years, culminated in family tragedy when he and Jason were in a serious car accident. A.J. escaped relatively unhurt, but Jason was left with amnesia and brain damage. The family's attempts to make Jason remember alienated him from the family and he eventually rejected all of them including Monica in favor of working for local mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]]. As a result of all the tragedy in her life, Monica separated from Alan and longed to make herself feel better. Monica embarked on an affair with Dr. [[Pierce Dorman]], which predictably ended in disaster when Dorman made false allegations of sexual harassment against Monica. In court, Dorman's lawyers brought up Monica's past indiscretions, including her affair with Ned and ended up winning the case. Monica was fired from General Hospital as a result. Monica also had to deal with both A.J.'s alcoholism and Emily's drug addiction. Monica snapped and kidnapped Dorman, and threatened to give him a lobotomy. Only Jason's intervention stopped her from doing so. Eventually though, Monica was vindicated when Dorman was murdered and revealed to have been a drug dealer. Monica and the rest of the Quartermaines were both shocked and delighted when it was revealed that the presumably deceased Lesley Webber was very much alive. When Monica went to visit her old rival, the mentally fragile Lesley calmly said she could never ever forget Monica. The two women would socialize at hospital events even though Lesley did not return to the medical profession, but on occasion, their pasts would create some comic tension.\n\nMore family drama ensued in 1998 when [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Roberts]] claimed that her son [[Michael Corinthos III|Michael]] was Jason's. Monica's father-in-law, [[Edward Quartermaine]], wanted to gain custody of Michael and thus Jason, who had been growing close to the Quartermaines was alienated from the family once again. Eventually, it was revealed that Jason was covering for Carly and that Michael was not Jason's son, but rather A.J.'s. During this time, Alan had become addicted to painkillers, which caused another brief estrangement between Alan and Monica.\n\n===2000s===\nAlan and Monica eventually reconciled and briefly considered trying for another baby. In 2001, they decided to renew their vows only for [[Skye Quartermaine|Skye Chandler]] to turn up and claim that she was Alan's daughter. While Monica and Skye clashed at first, they eventually established a cordial relationship and Monica even allowed Skye to stay at the mansion after Tracy revealed she wasn't Alan's daughter after all. Alan and Monica stayed stable for several years, even as drama occurred amongst their children. A.J. lost custody of Michael to Carly and her new husband Sonny Corinthos, while Emily was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and later diagnosed with breast cancer. When [[Rick Webber]] returned to town for Laura's remarriage to Luke, he re-kindled his old friendship with Monica which caused Alan to become jealous of them once again and brought back some bad memories for Lesley Webber who had never stopped loving him. When Rick was suddenly killed, Alan and Monica were both mentioned as suspects, and for a long time, everybody believed that Laura had killed him in self-defense. The real killer was eventually revealed to be Scotty Baldwin.\n\nIn 2005, A.J. faked his death as part of a complicated plot to frame his ex-wife, [[Courtney Matthews]], for murder and eventually kidnap his son Michael. Alan and Monica blamed each other for failing to show A.J. enough love and attention and once again a rift began in their marriage. When A.J. turned up alive and was subsequently murdered, Alan and Monica separated. Monica also believed that she had witnessed Michael kill A.J. and helped in the cover up, though eventually it was revealed that her grandson was not to blame. Monica and Alan eventually patched up their differences and decided to remain married.\n\nAs of 2006, Monica spends most of her time at the hospital, or being amused by the various dramas that have been occurring in her family. In February 2007, she was devastated by the death of her husband Alan, followed in November 2007 by the death of Emily after district attorney and Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] tightened security at the Metro Court Hotel. Monica blamed Jason for Emily's death. Even though he was her only child left, she would not have anything to do with him, and turned to alcohol. Her drinking led to her being sued for medical malpractice by her sister-in-law [[Tracy Quartermaine Spencer|Tracy Quartermaine]] after a botched surgery that Monica performed on Tracy's husband [[Luke Spencer]]. Monica also drank while driving, and hit [[Sam McCall]] in a hit and run. She continued to blame Jason both for her grief and her drinking problem because his job had cost her Alan, A.J. and Emily.\n\nMonica's drinking landed her in a horrific car accident; Jason insisted that she seek treatment otherwise he would report her to the police. Monica chose to get help and report herself. Monica would reconcile with Jason, apologize for the way she had treated him and reassure him that regardless of his parentage, she thought of him aa her son and she loves him. Jason would promise help her in future, be a better son, and hire his lawyer [[Diane Miller]] (who bores a striking resemblance to Ric) to defend Monica. She pleaded guilty to Sam's hit and run and driving while under the influence. Though a deal was made to have Monica attend rehab and do six months of community service, the judge insists that Monica deserves a more severe punishment, stating that Monica's grief did not give her an excuse to endanger people's lives and that she should have sought help for her condition sooner. However, Nikolas and Sam's testimonies convinced the judge to accept Monica's plea bargain.\n\nMonica resumed her position as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with the rest of the operation room's surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that was inside the patient. She was taken to the ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer [[Rebecca Shaw (General Hospital)|Rebecca Shaw]], Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.\n\nMonica once again became a key player in the reconstruction efforts for General Hospital to re-open after the toxin outbreak. She later stepped down from her role as Chief of Staff, contacting former physician [[Steven Webber|Dr. Steven Webber]] to take over for her so that she could re-focus on her specialty of cardiology.\n\n===2010s===\nEarly in the decade, Monica was seen infrequently, often not present from Quartermaine family events because it is too painful for her after Alan's death. After [[Elizabeth Webber]]'s son, [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Webber]], died in a hit-and-run, Monica found out that he was actually Jason's son. She was heartbroken over Jake's death, and admonished both Jason and Elizabeth for denying her the right to know her grandson. She also yelled at Luke, the driver who accidentally hit Jake. After Jason is admitted to the hospital following a car accident, Monica finds out that he & Sam are engaged. She imagines a life where Jason never got in the car with A.J., and was still Jason Quartermaine. She's later glad to still have Jason as he is. When Jason eventually woke up, she helped him and Sam plan their wedding. She gave Alan's wedding ring to Sam, who in turn gave it to Jason on their wedding day. Monica eventually returns to her job as Chief of Staff at the hospital.\n\nMonica is thrilled when Jason and Sam have a son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Morgan]], and ask her to be part of her grandson's life. Sadly, Jason disappears, and is presumed dead shortly after, and Monica had to deal with losing another child. At the same time, A.J. returns, and it's revealed that Monica helped him fake his death and sneak out of the country to avoid the criminal charges. A.J. comes back, wanting to reconnect with his family, especially Michael. Monica supported him, despite others saying he was going to cause trouble. However, he did reconnect with Michael and, in turn, Monica. When A.J. was accused of murdering [[Connie Falconeri]] and lapsed back into alcoholism, Monica got fired as chief of staff trying to support A.J. She lost her son again when A.J. was murdered by Sonny. Monica was furious, but happy when Michael disowned Sonny and started to bond more with the Quartermaines because of Sonny being like [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]].\n\nMonica found out that Jake was actually alive, having been held captive by [[Helena Cassadine]], and got a chance to be a part of Jake's life. She also bonded with \"Jake Doe,\" an amnesiac patient who had a facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. It later turned out that \"Jake Doe\" was actually Jason, though he had no memories of his past. Monica promised not to make the same mistakes with Jason that she made before, and was able to reconnect with him. Meanwhile, Monica had to deal with the new chief of staff, [[Liesl Obrecht]], and her strict conduct rules. Tracy, though, helped Monica get back the job after Monica called in Dr. [[General Hospital characters (2016)#Hamilton Finn|Hamilton Finn]] to help an ailing Tracy. She fought to help Finn stay on staff, despite Liesl's objections. Jason, meanwhile, recovered his memories, and apologized to Monica for pushing her away for many years. He promised to make more of an effort to include her as his mother; Monica assured Jason that she loved him.\n\nMonica was targeted by the General Hospital serial killer, later revealed to be [[Paul Hornsby]] who is like [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] and [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Victor Cassadine|Victor Cassadine]]. She was attacked and left unconscious, but was saved by Nurse [[Sabrina Santiago]]. Unfortunately, Sabrina figured out Paul was the culprit, and he killed her to keep her silent. Monica survived, but she and Tracy were forced to shut down General Hospital to prevent anyone else from getting killed. When Paul was caught and sent to prison, she and Tracy both feverishly worked to get the hospital opened up again. They succeeded, but were facing financial trouble trying to keep the hospital open. Monica and the Quartermaines rallied together, and decided to buy out the hospital so that it wouldn't be sold to develop condominiums. With Finn's help, they succeeded in stopping the Jeromes in their tracks. Monica was there when Jason and Sam decided to name their newborn daughter [[Emily Morgan (General Hospital)|Emily]], in honor of Monica's daughter. She was thrilled by the tribute, and met her granddaughter after [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] was sent to a mental asylum when Judge Horace Sanchez found out Liv was unfit to stand trial.\n\nIn January 2019, Monica learned from Scotty that the widowed Gail Baldwin had died.

She is a [[cardiologist]] at the eponymous hospital, and [[widow]] of physician [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]). The role was originated by Patsy Rahn in 1976, who played the role until [[showrunner]]s replaced her with Charleson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> Charleson's tenure with the [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] is [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|one of the longest in American soap operas]].\n\n==Character and casting==\nMonica becomes [[Chief Physician|Chief of Staff]] at General Hospital following the death of her husband, [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]]. Her specialty is [[cardiology]]. Her various affairs, primarily with fellow doctors [[Jeff Webber]] and his older brother [[Rick Webber]], and her quarrels with husband and their dysfunctional family were all major stories on the show throughout the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn her time on the show, Monica has battled [[breast cancer]], and dealt with outliving almost all of her children. Her two remaining children are Jason Morgan and Skye Quartermaine. She is the owner of the [[Quartermaine]] mansion, as she often reminds her family when they begin quarreling. She has been known to throw them out of her house.\n\nIn 2006, she only had rare appearances. New storylines developed in 2007 (an investigation into the murder of Rick Webber, the deaths of her husband and daughter [[Emily Quartermaine]]), and she is being featured more prominently.\n\nWith the returns of [[Denise Alexander]] ([[Lesley Webber]]), [[Genie Francis]] ([[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]]), and [[Kin Shriner]] ([[Scott Baldwin]]), Monica remains the fourth oldest character on ''General Hospital''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|title=General Hospital 1976|date=January 1, 1976|work=[[ABC Daytime]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=[[New York City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326104340/http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hvROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6987%2C5357067|title=Frank Plans To Divorce Nancy; Mac Moves Back With Rachel|date=February 21, 1977|department=The Soaps|first=Lynda|last=Hirsch|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/features/9303190826_1_leslie-charleson-soap-gloria-monty|title=Seeing 'General Hospital' Through Good Times And Ill|date=March 10, 1993|first=Marla|last=Hart|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> and Charleson is the show's most tenured performer.<ref name=\"Monica Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |title=Character Monica Quartermaine Biography |publisher=[[ABC Daytime]] |work=[[General Hospital]] |location=United States |accessdate=July 10, 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919003854/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0825-charleson.php|title=Leslie Charleson dropped to recurring status|website=[[SoapCentral]]|location=United States|publisher=Soap Central Live|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Charleson off contract\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Fairman|title=Leslie Charleson taken off contract at GH!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/leslie-charleson-taken-off-contract-at-gh/2010/08/24/|website=[[Michael Fairman TV]]|publisher=The Michael Fairman Company|location=United States|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, newly appointed head writer [[Garin Wolf]] expressed his interest in having Charleson appear on a much more frequent basis.

However, Greg, Gail's husband took advantage of Monica and raped her. Gail remained unaware of this for many years but the two were able to reconcile once the truth came out. Monica was able to use her experience with Greg to help [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]] when she was raped.\n\nMonica later had an affair with David Langston and gave birth to a daughter, Dawn, whom she gave up for adoption.\n\nJust prior to her arrival on GH, Monica had been engaged to [[Rick Webber]]. However, he had broken up with her and flew off to [[Africa]] where he became caught up in a [[civil war]] and was presumed dead. Monica turned to [[Jeff Webber]], Rick's brother, for comfort and married him, not knowing that Rick was still alive.\n\n===1970s===\nMonica arrived in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] in 1976, having recently married [[Jeff Webber]]. [[Steve Hardy]], who had been recently appointed as Chief of Staff at [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)#General Hospital|General Hospital]], invited the couple to take part in his ''Mr. and Mrs. Intern Programme'', believing that the couple had an idyllic marriage. However, the truth was that Monica had only married Jeff on the rebound. She was still deeply in love with Jeff's brother, Rick, who had been presumed dead in Africa. Thus, the marriage collapsed when Rick was revealed to be still alive and Monica cheated on Jeff with Rick, while Jeff cheated on Monica with [[Heather Grant]], with whom he had a son, [[Steven Webber]]. Jeff and Monica divorced in 1977.\n\nThroughout this time, Rick had grown close to [[Lesley Webber|Lesley Faulkner]] and planned to marry her. Monica was devastated, and tried to put a stop to it, blackmailing Lesley into turning down Rick's proposal. If Lesley didn't, Monica would tell the hospital board of Monica's affair with Rick, denying him the opportunity to become Chief of Cardiology at General Hospital. During the argument, a pregnant Lesley fell down the stairs and miscarried. Lesley was despondent, and called off her engagement to Rick, hoping to save Rick's career. Meanwhile, Monica and Rick talk about how important the promotion is to Rick, and Monica realizes she cannot go through with her threat, but doesn't tell Lesley as much. Monica's found out when Lesley's daughter Laura's tape recorder is found to have caught Monica's threats to Lesley. Lesley and Rick are married in October 1977.\n\nRick and Monica's relationship becomes embittered, and Monica nearly loses her job, though Lesley sets aside her personal feelings and vouches for Monica's talents as a doctor to Steve, saving her job. Monica claims to be moving on, but she and Rick are forced to work together with [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] on plans for a new wing at the hospital. Monica makes a last-ditch effort to bed Rick while trapped in a remote ranger station overnight during a storm while working on the project, but is turned down. While Monica continues to antagonize Lesley and Rick, she soon begins a relationship with Alan, though she's still very much attracted to Rick.\n\nMonica had doubts about her relationship with Alan, but these were soon overshadowed when Monica's foster mother Gail Adamson discovered that Monica had slept with Gail's late husband Greg. Gail did not believe Monica's explanation that Greg had forced her into the affair and cut ties with Monica. Monica turned to Alan for support and agreed to marry him. Eventually Gail and Monica made amends. She was thrilled when Gail found happiness by finally agreeing to marry [[Lee Baldwin]] after months of putting him off. Monica became a close confidante to Laura who found that Monica treated her like an adult while her mother continuously treated her like a child.\n\nAfter their 1978 wedding, Alan bought a mansion for Monica as a wedding present, and his family ended up re-settling in Port Charles as well. Monica adored Alan's parents, Edward (who ran the family empire, ELQ) and Lila, but his sister, Tracy, felt Monica was beneath them and caused problems every chance she got. Monica continued to be a confidante to Lesley's young daughter, Laura, and when nurse Bobbie Spencer began to harass Laura and blamed her for attacking her in the hospital book store, Monica took Laura's side, realizing the extent of her own harassment towards Lesley whom she made an effort to become friends with. However, within a year of her second marriage, Monica once again fell into Rick's arms and the two had a one-night stand. Monica was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Tracy, who had made efforts to get to know her sister-in-law whom she respected as a physician, suspected the truth and plotted to have the unborn child declared illegitimate so her son Ned would inherit the Quartermaine estate. For many months, Monica was bedridden, and innocent student nurse [[Amy Vining]] her only companion. Monica was unaware that the gossipy Amy was totally enamored of the handsome Alan who used her as a spy to keep an eye on his wife. Monica gave birth to a son, [[A. J. Quartermaine|A.J.]] during the middle of a winter storm with only Gail and Lesley present and screamed out that Rick was the father.\n\n===1980s===\nRick and Lesley divorced so Rick and Monica could be together. Alan was enraged by this turn of events and made several attempts to kill Rick and Monica, but was thwarted at every attempt. While both Scotty and Lee found Monica's actions repulsive, their wives Laura and Gail were more compassionate even though Laura was heartsick at seeing Lesley and her adoptive father separated. Monica managed to trick Alan into admitting on tape that he had tried to kill her and Rick and moved into Tracy's old apartment as she prepared to file for an uncontested divorce. Eventually, both Monica and Alan realized that A.J. was indeed Alan's son and not Rick's. Monica attempted to hide this fact from Rick, but Alan eventually exposed the truth that there were rare circumstances when two parents with type O blood could conceive a type B blood baby. Rick, disgusted with Monica's continued manipulations, left her and focused on the formation of the waterfront clinic. A confrontation with Lesley over the revelation of Alan Jr.'s paternity ended up with Monica viciously maligning Lesley's lack of passion and Lesley's surprising response of a hard slap across Monica's face. The next day when Monica went to get her final divorce decree, she discovered that Alan had contested it, and when she confronted him, he threatened her with the loss of her son for her actions, forcing her to return to him even though she couldn't stand the sight of him. Eventually, because of issues concerning Laura on the run, Rick went back to Lesley, having Monica removed as his assistant in surgery, although he later relented, citing their shared excellence in the operating room. Monica felt that she had no other alternative but to stay with Alan, biding her time to find a way out. The only good thing that happened for Monica around this time was Tracy's departure after discovering that her husband [[Mitch Williams]] was having an affair with sexy waitress [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]] who ended up being manager of the Campus Disco which Alan bought as a side investment after owner [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]] was sent to prison for mob activities.\n\nFollowing their 'reconciliation', Monica refused to sleep with Alan and insisted on separate rooms. Despite attempts by both to be civil to each other, Alan grew frustrated and in 1981, he embarked on an affair with Susan, who became pregnant and would give birth to Alan's son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] while out of town. Alan moved Susan into a cottage but continued to live in the Quartermaine mansion until the tensions became so great between him and Monica that he moved in with Susan. The only calm moments between Alan and Monica was their shared desire to prove that Alan's cousin, [[Alexandria Quartermaine]] was utilizing the family fortune in ways that would not keep their holdings strong. Monica was greatly amused when Alexandria's will left all of her ELQ stock to Lila, putting her in control and keeping Edward from making deals he felt important to gain more money and power. Monica hired private investigator Larry Corrigan ([[Frank Ashmore]]) to get proof of Alan's affair with Susan, and he took a job at the campus disco, managing it after Susan went to New York to have her baby. Between Larry and Cathy Summers (A.J.'s nanny), she got the evidence she needed and used it to make Alan's life a living hell. In spite of public scenes at the hospital which caused both of them to be reprimanded by Steve Hardy, Monica would continue to be seen with Alan at social functions, including Luke and Laura's wedding, even though she was preparing to file for divorce and sell the Quartermaine house, a move that Alan put a stop to. But the chemistry between Alan and Susan soon waned and he found himself becoming bored with her which lead to him unable to make love. Arguing with Monica over Susan and Jason led to them admitting their passion for one another, and Alan broke off with Susan who sued him for palimony and major child support. The final straw for Alan came when she turned into a drunk and married Scott Baldwin after being in a horrendous car accident. In 1983, Susan was murdered by Lila's first husband, Crane Tolliver (discovered after all of the Quartermaines, including Monica, were questioned as suspects), and Susan's aunt Alice Grant took Jason in. After Alice died of an embolism a few months later, Monica and Alan fought her daughter, Heather (the same Heather whom Jeff had cheated on Monica with seven years earlier) for custody of the baby. Monica was not pleased at having her husband's illegitimate offspring in the house at first, but eventually grew to love Jason as if he were her own. She later legally adopted him as well.\n\nMonica was saddened by the sudden death in a car accident of her old rival Lesley Webber whom she had somewhat made peace with. Only a few months before, the Quartermaines had shared in the Webber family's joy over Laura Spencer's return from the dead. While determined to make her marriage to Alan work this time around, Monica did become a source of comfort for her ex-lover, Rick, and even wished him much happiness when he married [[Ginny Blake]], the natural mother of Rick and Lesley's adopted son, Mikey. The Quartermaines had more than their share of tensions on their hand when Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt showed up and ended up with proof that Edward and Lila's marriage had not been legal. The following year, Jimmy Lee's mother, Beatrice LaSeur, showed up and proceeded to attempt to blackmail the family, leading to her apparent murder in which Monica was once again a suspect. But she had accidentally drank Lila's heart medication which caused her death. One of the suspects in Beatrice's death was spa owner [[Lorena Sharpe]] who turned out to be Monica's long-lost cousin. In 1986, Monica had an affair with [[Sean Donely]], and kicked all the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]s out of the mansion. Alan concocted a bizarre scheme to frame Sean for his 'murder' and even went missing for several months as part of the plan. Eventually, Sean left Monica for [[Tiffany Hill]], and Monica reluctantly reconciled with Alan and let the Quartermaines back into the mansion.\n\nMonica went away to a spa resort and ended up sleeping with one of the workers there, a young man named Ward. To Monica's surprise, Ward turned out to be [[List of past General Hospital characters#Ned Ashton|Ned Ashton]], the son of her sister-in-law, [[Tracy Quartermaine]] (who came back after a decade's absence) and thus, Alan's nephew. The two agreed to keep the affair a secret, but soon another secret of Monica's would come out. Monica's secret daughter, [[Dawn Winthrop]] turned up and began dating Ned. These two secrets proved at last to be the deathblow to Monica and Alan's marriage and the two divorced. Alan later married [[Lucy Coe]] in 1990. During this time, the family believed that Edward had been killed in a helicopter crash and fought brutally over his estate.\n\n===1990s===\nDawn was later murdered and Monica was devastated by her death. After Alan's marriage to Lucy also proved a disaster, Monica and Alan were drawn back together by their son A.J's rebellious behavior. In 1991, the two remarried and the next three years of their marriage were relatively calm, although the return of David Langton (Dawn's father), A.J.'s relationship with David's daughter Nikki and Alan's friendship with Rhonda Wexler did give the couple some cause for concern. It was during this time that Edward was found alive and returned to Port Charles to help the Quartermaine's take on the cartel who had tried to take over ELQ. Alan and Monica also welcomed Lee and Gail Baldwin back to Port Charles, getting Gail to provide some therapy for the problematic A.J. Monica supported Alan fully when he confessed to her that he had discovered that Ray Conway, Rhonda's boyfriend, had sexually molested Karen, and had pushed him after finding Ray beating up Rhonda, causing Ray to hit his head and die.\n\nMonica's life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Monica became despondent and began pushing Alan away, though Alan fought hard to give Monica the support she needed. During this time, Monica befriended [[Paige Bowen]], a fellow cancer patient. Monica was devastated when Paige died, but ended up adopting Paige's daughter, [[Emily Quartermaine|Emily]]. Finally, Monica went into remission, but she and Alan were drifting further and further apart.\n\nBy 1995, A.J.'s alcoholism, which had been developing for several years, culminated in family tragedy when he and Jason were in a serious car accident. A.J. escaped relatively unhurt, but Jason was left with amnesia and brain damage. The family's attempts to make Jason remember alienated him from the family and he eventually rejected all of them including Monica in favor of working for local mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]]. As a result of all the tragedy in her life, Monica separated from Alan and longed to make herself feel better. Monica embarked on an affair with Dr. [[Pierce Dorman]], which predictably ended in disaster when Dorman made false allegations of sexual harassment against Monica. In court, Dorman's lawyers brought up Monica's past indiscretions, including her affair with Ned and ended up winning the case. Monica was fired from General Hospital as a result. Monica also had to deal with both A.J.'s alcoholism and Emily's drug addiction. Monica snapped and kidnapped Dorman, and threatened to give him a lobotomy. Only Jason's intervention stopped her from doing so. Eventually though, Monica was vindicated when Dorman was murdered and revealed to have been a drug dealer. Monica and the rest of the Quartermaines were both shocked and delighted when it was revealed that the presumably deceased Lesley Webber was very much alive. When Monica went to visit her old rival, the mentally fragile Lesley calmly said she could never ever forget Monica. The two women would socialize at hospital events even though Lesley did not return to the medical profession, but on occasion, their pasts would create some comic tension.\n\nMore family drama ensued in 1998 when [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Roberts]] claimed that her son [[Michael Corinthos III|Michael]] was Jason's. Monica's father-in-law, [[Edward Quartermaine]], wanted to gain custody of Michael and thus Jason, who had been growing close to the Quartermaines was alienated from the family once again. Eventually, it was revealed that Jason was covering for Carly and that Michael was not Jason's son, but rather A.J.'s. During this time, Alan had become addicted to painkillers, which caused another brief estrangement between Alan and Monica.\n\n===2000s===\nAlan and Monica eventually reconciled and briefly considered trying for another baby. In 2001, they decided to renew their vows only for [[Skye Quartermaine|Skye Chandler]] to turn up and claim that she was Alan's daughter. While Monica and Skye clashed at first, they eventually established a cordial relationship and Monica even allowed Skye to stay at the mansion after Tracy revealed she wasn't Alan's daughter after all. Alan and Monica stayed stable for several years, even as drama occurred amongst their children. A.J. lost custody of Michael to Carly and her new husband Sonny Corinthos, while Emily was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and later diagnosed with breast cancer. When [[Rick Webber]] returned to town for Laura's remarriage to Luke, he re-kindled his old friendship with Monica which caused Alan to become jealous of them once again and brought back some bad memories for Lesley Webber who had never stopped loving him. When Rick was suddenly killed, Alan and Monica were both mentioned as suspects, and for a long time, everybody believed that Laura had killed him in self-defense. The real killer was eventually revealed to be Scotty Baldwin.\n\nIn 2005, A.J. faked his death as part of a complicated plot to frame his ex-wife, [[Courtney Matthews]], for murder and eventually kidnap his son Michael. Alan and Monica blamed each other for failing to show A.J. enough love and attention and once again a rift began in their marriage. When A.J. turned up alive and was subsequently murdered, Alan and Monica separated. Monica also believed that she had witnessed Michael kill A.J. and helped in the cover up, though eventually it was revealed that her grandson was not to blame. Monica and Alan eventually patched up their differences and decided to remain married.\n\nAs of 2006, Monica spends most of her time at the hospital, or being amused by the various dramas that have been occurring in her family. In February 2007, she was devastated by the death of her husband Alan, followed in November 2007 by the death of Emily after district attorney and Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] tightened security at the Metro Court Hotel. Monica blamed Jason for Emily's death. Even though he was her only child left, she would not have anything to do with him, and turned to alcohol. Her drinking led to her being sued for medical malpractice by her sister-in-law [[Tracy Quartermaine Spencer|Tracy Quartermaine]] after a botched surgery that Monica performed on Tracy's husband [[Luke Spencer]]. Monica also drank while driving, and hit [[Sam McCall]] in a hit and run. She continued to blame Jason both for her grief and her drinking problem because his job had cost her Alan, A.J. and Emily.\n\nMonica's drinking landed her in a horrific car accident; Jason insisted that she seek treatment otherwise he would report her to the police. Monica chose to get help and report herself. Monica would reconcile with Jason, apologize for the way she had treated him and reassure him that regardless of his parentage, she thought of him aa her son and she loves him. Jason would promise help her in future, be a better son, and hire his lawyer [[Diane Miller]] (who bores a striking resemblance to Ric) to defend Monica. She pleaded guilty to Sam's hit and run and driving while under the influence. Though a deal was made to have Monica attend rehab and do six months of community service, the judge insists that Monica deserves a more severe punishment, stating that Monica's grief did not give her an excuse to endanger people's lives and that she should have sought help for her condition sooner. However, Nikolas and Sam's testimonies convinced the judge to accept Monica's plea bargain.\n\nMonica resumed her position as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with the rest of the operation room's surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that was inside the patient. She was taken to the ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer [[Rebecca Shaw (General Hospital)|Rebecca Shaw]], Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.\n\nMonica once again became a key player in the reconstruction efforts for General Hospital to re-open after the toxin outbreak. She later stepped down from her role as Chief of Staff, contacting former physician [[Steven Webber|Dr. Steven Webber]] to take over for her so that she could re-focus on her specialty of cardiology.\n\n===2010s===\nEarly in the decade, Monica was seen infrequently, often not present from Quartermaine family events because it is too painful for her after Alan's death. After [[Elizabeth Webber]]'s son, [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Webber]], died in a hit-and-run, Monica found out that he was actually Jason's son. She was heartbroken over Jake's death, and admonished both Jason and Elizabeth for denying her the right to know her grandson. She also yelled at Luke, the driver who accidentally hit Jake. After Jason is admitted to the hospital following a car accident, Monica finds out that he & Sam are engaged. She imagines a life where Jason never got in the car with A.J., and was still Jason Quartermaine. She's later glad to still have Jason as he is. When Jason eventually woke up, she helped him and Sam plan their wedding. She gave Alan's wedding ring to Sam, who in turn gave it to Jason on their wedding day. Monica eventually returns to her job as Chief of Staff at the hospital.\n\nMonica is thrilled when Jason and Sam have a son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Morgan]], and ask her to be part of her grandson's life. Sadly, Jason disappears, and is presumed dead shortly after, and Monica had to deal with losing another child. At the same time, A.J. returns, and it's revealed that Monica helped him fake his death and sneak out of the country to avoid the criminal charges. A.J. comes back, wanting to reconnect with his family, especially Michael. Monica supported him, despite others saying he was going to cause trouble. However, he did reconnect with Michael and, in turn, Monica. When A.J. was accused of murdering [[Connie Falconeri]] and lapsed back into alcoholism, Monica got fired as chief of staff trying to support A.J. She lost her son again when A.J. was murdered by Sonny.
