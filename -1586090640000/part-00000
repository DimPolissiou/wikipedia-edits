It was formed as per the instructions given by Swami Vivekananda, a patriot-saint of India. Fifty years after the passing away of Swami Vivekananda, in 1954, the Sri Sarada Math was established at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata with a group of eight nuns. \n\nThe headquarters of Sri Sarada Math is situated on the bank of Ganga in Dakshineshwar, Kolkata. Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia. \n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]]. \n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They had intense dispassion for the world. \n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates if the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were Pravrajika Bharatiprana, Pravrajika Mokshaprana, Pravrajika Muktiprana, Pravrajika Dayaprana, Pravrajika Vidyaprana, Pravrajika Shraddhaprana, Pravrajika Bhaktiprana, and Pravrajika Medhaprana. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But by his love and grace, [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the Sister Nivedita Girls School to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math\u2019s emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen. \nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Presidents ==\nThe first president of the Math was Pravrajika Bharatiprana. Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]]. Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Sarala Devi lived in [[Varanasi]] from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines. She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from [[Swami Saradananda]]. Assuming the leadership of the Sri Sarada Math, Bharatiprana served from December 1954 to January 1973, till her Mahasamadhi. \nHer pious life was written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''Bharatiprana Smriti Katha'' and later translated in [[English]] by Pravrajika Atmaprana as Pravrajika Bharatiprana.\n\n== The Idea ==\nThe idea to form a monastic institution for women was first envisioned by [[Swami Vivekananda]], long before he established the well-known [[Ramakrishna Math]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women\u2019s Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901. \n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\nMother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive\u2026[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi|Maitreyis]] be born into the world\u2026 Hence it is her Math that I want first\u2026 Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished\u2026.
