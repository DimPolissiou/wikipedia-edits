Its transmitter is located in [[Moraine, Ohio|Moraine]] and can be heard clearly throughout Southwest Ohio, including nearly all of [[Cincinnati metropolitan area|Greater Cincinnati]]. 104.7 WTUE can also be heard as far north as [[Wapakoneta, Ohio|Wapakoneta]] also to the east in places [[London, Ohio|London]] and over to the west [[Richmond, Indiana]].\n\nBriefly known as WIFE-FM and WTWO, WTUE's beginnings was that of WONE-FM simulcasting sister station WONE which had a Top 40 format until 1967. WONE-FM played Top 40 hits without live personalities when WONE switched to country in 1969. In 1971, the FCC granted permission to boost its power to 50,000 watts and monaural WONE-FM transformed to FM-stereo, and briefly quadraphonic, \"the all new W-2\" under the programming of Bill Struck, followed by Gregg Mason (Terry Dorsey). In 1974, WTUE was \"The Super Ten Four!\" with morning personality Gregg Mason, Sean McKay in the 10 am \u2013 2 pm slot, Al Morgan 2 pm \u2013 4 pm, Bill Lyons 4 pm \u2013 8 pm and Dave Michaels 8pm-Midnight.\n\nThe station was playing Top 40 hits with live DJs until 1976 when it switched to the new and innovative [[album oriented rock]] format under the direction of Dave Michaels as Program Director. Gregg Mason was moved to sister station, 98 Country WONE. Patty Spitler, who had been the Morning Host at the University Of Dayton's WVUD, (considered \"underground rock\" at the time) would become \"T-105's first Morning Show Host.  Dave Michaels (Dave Ingersoll) left WTUE and was replaced by Chuck Browning as Program Director from M 105 (WWWM) in Cleveland. Browning also held a 2 hour air shift between 10am-2pm Monday-Friday.\n\nSean Scott (Sean Scott Sizemore) was the first AOR announcer hired from North Carolina by WTUE to replace Al Morgan in the 4 pm \u2013 8 pm slot. Scott was also WTUE's first Music Director. This was the beginning of the transformation from WTUE, the rock station manned by Top-40 announcers, to a station who staffed themselves by hiring graduates of the University of Dayton's radio station, WVUD. Patty Spitler, Bob Clark, Jim Tobin, Dan Pugh (Dan Patrick), Bill Pugh, Dave Luczak, Kevin Crisler (K.C), Sandy Smith and Alan McConnell were all graduates (or at least attended) The University of Dayton and were all part of their radio program. McConnell, whose name was changed to Mike McConnell because Alan Sells was a part time announcer and the station thought one Alan was enough. Alan Sells, who was hired as a part timer while at suburban Stebbins High School in 1974 was given his first full-time slot holding down the 8 pm \u2013 1 am in 1976 until his departure for Cincinnati's WSAI-FM in 1979. Sells is now Big Al of Big Al and Charlie at KFRQ in McAllen/Brownsville, TX.\n\nEarly 1979 was a transitional point for WTUE.  Patty Spitler left the station.  Sue Arenston joined the station from Cincinnati and Sean \"The Space Cowboy\" Scott was moved to the Morning slot.  Alan McConnell who came to WTUE as a fill in jock was given the 4 pm \u2013 8 pm slot. Scott would soon leave WTUE for WMAD in Madison, Wisconsin to pursue his desire to program his own radio station.  After Several years in Madison, Sean Scott left Madison and radio.  [[Mike McConnell (radio personality)|Mike McConnell]] would soon become the Program Director at WTUE to replace Chuck Browning who left the airwaves to take a larger management role at 11 South Wilkinson, where the station had been located. McConnell would go on to Program WSKS-FM, 96 ROCK, in Hamilton in May 1982 before moving to sister station WLW in Cincinnati a little over a year later. McConnell remained at WLW until 2010 when it was announced he would be moving to Chicago to become a host for WGN-AM. In 2013 McConnell left WGN. In 2014, he returned to WLW where he currently is the morning show host.\n\nSports personality and University of Dayton graduate [[Dan Patrick]] was half of the morning team on WTUE in the late-1970s/early-1980s under his given name, Dan Pugh. Dan was partnered as morning host with several other DJs over the years including Sean Scott, Dave Luczak, Major Dick Hale and Jeff Curry.  WTUE was awarded Billboard Magazine's coveted \"Station Of The Year\" in the album-oriented rock format for medium-sized markets in 1983 under Program Director Bill Pugh (Dan Pugh's brother) and again in 1985 under Tom Carroll who served as Program Director from 1984\u20131997.\n\nDuring 1986-1999, WTUE was home to the highly rated Kerrigan & Christopher morning show.  Christopher (Geisen) left the station in 1999 and (Steve) Kerrigan left WTUE's airwaves in 2003.  Steve Kerrigan died of multiple myeloma in March 2011.  Steve Kerrigan was inducted into the Dayton Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2011.  Christopher Geisen was inducted in 2017, and John \"B-Man\" Beaulieu was inducted in 2013.\n\nWTUE is currently an affiliate of ''[[The Bob and Tom Show]]'' in the mornings and features afternoon veteran John \"B-Man\" Beaulieu.  Christopher Geisen and Mike Thomas also served as Program Directors prior to Tony Tilford.  Dent is the current WTUE Program Director.  Christopher Geisen has recently returned to WTUE Mid-days (10am-3pm), Beaulieu afternoons, and Dent 7pm-12Mid.\n\nStation ownership has included Group One Broadcasting (Akron), DKM Broadcasting, Summit Communications, Stoner Broadcasting, [[American Radio Systems]], Inc., [[Jacor Communications]] and [[Citicasters|Citicasters Co.]], a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications.\n\n==HD radio==\nIn March 2007, WTUE began broadcasts in [[HD-Radio]] by simulcasting its analog audio on its HD1 stream and broadcasting a more album-oriented rock format on its HD2 stream.

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5373|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]750&nbsp;million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.<ref name=\"Terry's Story\" />\n\nFox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], [[Terry Fox Secondary School|high school]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in [[Vancouver]], winning three national championships.\n\nIn 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24&nbsp;million people. He began with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], Fox won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.\n\n==Early life and cancer==\nTerry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to Rolland and [[Betty Fox]].

He stated that he would \"conquer\" his disability, and promised to complete his run, even if he had to \"crawl every last mile\". Explaining why he wanted to raise money for research, Fox described his personal experience of cancer treatment:{{quote|I soon realized that that would only be half my quest, for as I went through the 16 months of the physically and emotionally draining ordeal of chemotherapy, I was rudely awakened by the feelings that surrounded and coursed through the cancer clinic. There were faces with the brave smiles, and the ones who had given up smiling. There were feelings of hopeful denial, and the feelings of despair. My quest would not be a selfish one. I could not leave knowing these faces and feelings would still exist, even though I would be set free from mine.

I believe in miracles. I have to.\"<ref name=cosentino/> The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]&nbsp;\u2013 an enlarged heart&nbsp;\u2013 a condition commonly associated with athletes.

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5373|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]750&nbsp;million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.<ref name=\"Terry's Story\" />\n\nFox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], [[Terry Fox Secondary School|high school]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in [[Vancouver]], winning three national championships.\n\nIn 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], Fox won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.\n\n==Early life and cancer==\nTerry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to Rolland and [[Betty Fox]]. Rolland was a switchman for the [[Canadian National Railway]].<ref name=\"MtlGazette42880\">{{cite news|last=Scrivener|first=Leslie|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kBQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1162,4206618|title=Terry's running for the cancer society|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|date=April 28, 1980|accessdate=February 25, 2010|page=21}}</ref> Fox had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrell, and a younger sister, Judith.<ref name=\"Greatest Canadian\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/fox-terry.html|title=The Greatest Canadian: Terry Fox|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=February 25, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121456/http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/fox-terry.html|archivedate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Fox's maternal grandmother is [[M\u00e9tis]] and Fox's younger brother Darrell has official M\u00e9tis status.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Ian|title=A marathon of genealogy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/terry-fox-was-metis-fox-family-explores-and-claims-metisheritage/article37517004/|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis family moved to [[Surrey, British Columbia]], in 1966, then settled in [[Port Coquitlam]], in 1968.<ref name=\"Greatest Canadian\"/> His parents were dedicated to their family, and his mother was especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed to do.<ref name=\"Scrivener13\">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Fox hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.<ref name=\"Inwood\">{{cite news|first=Damian|last=Inwood|title=Terry Fox: 25 years; Celebrating his dream: a 12-page special section honouring the 25th Annual Terry Fox Run|newspaper=Vancouver Province |date=September 18, 2005}}</ref>\n\nHe was an enthusiastic athlete, playing [[association football|soccer]], [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[baseball]] as a child.<ref name=\"Scrivener16\">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> His passion was for [[basketball]] and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight.

There were faces with the brave smiles, and the ones who had given up smiling. There were feelings of hopeful denial, and the feelings of despair. My quest would not be a selfish one.

The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to.\"<ref name=cosentino/> The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]&nbsp;\u2013 an enlarged heart&nbsp;\u2013 a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 69\u201370.</ref>\n\nA second letter was sent to several corporations seeking donations for a vehicle and running shoes, and to cover the other costs of the run.<ref name=\"Scrivener63\">Scrivener, 2000, p. 63.</ref> Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg.

Much of Palmerstown has been developed for residential, transportation and commercial purposes over the last half century. [[Townland]]s include:<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Palmerstown&streets=no Placenames Database of Ireland] - Palmerstown townlands</ref>\n* Palmerston Lower \n* Palmerston Upper \n* Irishtown\n* Saint Laurence\n* Johnstown\n* Palmerstown Manor\n* Yellow Walls\n* Fonthill\n* Redcowfarm\n* Woodfarm \n* Quarryvale\n* Brooklawn\n* Liffey Valley \n===Palmerstown village===\n[[Image:Stewarts Hospital.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The main building of Stewartscare and HSE from Mill Lane.]]\n[[Image:PalmerstownChurch.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The church in Palmerstown village.]]\nThe townlands of Palmerstown Upper and Palmerstown Lower straddle the old Lucan Road which was the ancient western highway. Many of Palmerstown's local amenities are located in a cluster along the road. Robin Villas and Hollyville were labourers' cottages built at the beginning of the last century. The old national school is now a community centre. Stewarts Hospital, (formerly the residence of the [[Earl of Donoughmore|Hely-Hutchinson]] family, the Roman Catholic Church of St. Philomena, the National School, the Palmerstown House Pub and Restaurant and a variety of general enterprises, including a bank and convenience stores are located here. [[Stewartscare]] is a health care facility at the Stewarts buildings and grounds which overlook the meandering Liffey valley. The Stewarts complex houses the administration of the Irish [[Health Service Executive]]. Stewarts Sports and Leisure centre is open to the general public. It also hosts an annual summer camp.\n\n===Redcow Farm===\n[[Image:Glenaulin Park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Glenaulin Park, adjacent to St. Patrick's GAA Club and home to many local sports fixtures]]\nThis area was the location of the first modern housing development in Palmerstown, constructed between 1955 and 1965. Centred on Manor road, this area contains several shops, the local credit union and a doctor's surgery. To the east of Redcow Farm, adjacent to the California Hills Park, is Glenaulin Sports Park, home of [[St. Patricks GAA Palmerstown|St. Patricks GAA club]].\nThe name 'California Hill' was given, by the children of the area, to a small wasteland to the East of Glenaulin Park, which had been a builder\u2019s dump during the construction of the main Palmerstown Estate in the mid to late 60's. The wasteland had a series of small hills which were in fact mounds of builders rubble which had been buried under clay and eventually over grown with wild grass. The children of the area sometimes shortened the name to 'The Caliers' and this name is also still in use today. The hills or mounds were flattened some years ago and the area landscaped for communal/public use.\n\n===Palmerston Lower===\nMill Lane leads to the original Palmerstown settlement and centre of industry, which once employed over 600 millhands, craftsmen, and labourers. This seventeenth-century low-lying waterside industrial village was complete with flax, seed, oil, and flour mills. The ruin of a pre-Norman church and the remains of the once prosperous thriving community are situated near the river. A small ferry crossed the Liffey here, to where the Wren's Nest pub was situated on the North side. A football ground opposite the river Liffey is home to [[Palmerstown F.C.]] Muhammad Ali visited Stewarts Hospital on the 15th of July 1972 when the hospital was hosting its annual sporting fete.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comeheretome.com/2016/06/09/when-muhammad-ali-came-to-palmerstown/|title=When Muhammad Ali came to Palmerstown.|date=2016-06-09|website=Come Here To Me!|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Palmerstown Manor===\nPalmerstown's largest housing estate was built in the early 1990s in the south east of the area. Adjacent to the Coldcut and Kennelsfort roads and the M50 motorway, the estate marks the 'border' between Palmerstown with [[Ballyfermot]] and [[Clondalkin]].\n\n===Woodfarm Acres===\nThe townland of Woodfarm Acres was mostly farmland, with a few council cottages previously existed on the site. This housing development was built during the 1970s. The estate is bounded by the M50 motorway and N4. Adjacent to Woodfarm Acres is another shopping centre containing a local [[SuperValu (Ireland)|SuperValu]] market, a bowling alley and other amenities. Access to the local cemetery is adjacent to this centre. The Silver Granite Pub is located nearby, as is ''Pobalscoil Isolde'', a secondary-level community school which opened in the 1980s.\n\n===Oakcourt===\nThe Oakcourt housing estate lies in the western part of the 59-acre Johnstown townland, behind Pobalscoil Iosolde. It was originally developed in the 1970s, and expanded in the mid-1990s. The Johnstown townland extends due west from the Georgian Johnstown House (now St. John's College) on Le Fanu Rd. It runs west to Kennelsfort Road and lies between St. Laurence townland (the St. Laurence House is now the West County Hotel) from the River Liffey and Chapelizod in the north, to Ballyfermot Upper/Blackditch on the south.\n\n==Transport==\nThe main public transport is Dublin Bus running via the N4 at Palmerstown village. Scheduled services run east to the city and west to [[Lucan]], [[Celbridge]], [[Leixlip]] and [[Maynooth]]. Route 26 operates from travels from Woodfarm Acres to Dublin city via Kennelsfort Road. Route 18, a circular city route runs from the Old Lucan Road to [[Sandymount]] Green via many south Dublin suburbs including [[Walkinstown]], [[Crumlin, Dublin|Crumlin]] and [[Rathgar]]. Route 40 operates via the Coldcut road to [[Finglas]] via Dublin city. Routes 67, 66, 66a, 66b, 25, 25a and 25b operates via the Chapelizod Bypass to [[Merrion Square]] via Dublin City.\nPalmerstown railway station on the [[Dublin and Lucan tramway]], later part of the [[Dublin United Transport Company]] tram system, opened in November 1881 and closed on 13 April 1940.<ref>{{cite web | title=Palmerstown station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-11-22|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Palmerstown Cemetery==\nPalmerstown Cemetery was originally opened in 1978. It is located on Kennelsfort Road, adjacent to Woodfarm Acres. It is currently being managed as part of the Glasnevin Trust.<ref>http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/funeral-services/palmerstown-cemetery/ Glasnevin Trust</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of towns and villages in the Republic of Ireland]]\n\n==Footnote==\n{{Reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.southdublinhistory.ie South Dublin County History]\n*[http://www.southdublinimages.ie South Dublin County Images]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404064257/http://prfc.ie/ Palmerstown Rangers Football Club Website]\n*[http://www.stpatricksgaa.ie St Patricks GAA Hurling, Football and Camogie Club Website]\n\n{{Dublin residential areas}}\n\n[[Category:Palmerstown|  ]]\n[[Category:Towns and villages in South Dublin (county)]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes of County Dublin]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = Palmerstown\n|other_name             = {{pad top italic|Baile Ph\u00e1mar}}\n|settlement_type        = Town\n|image_skyline          = \n|image_caption          = \n|pushpin_map            = Ireland\n|pushpin_label_position = right\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Ireland\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Leinster]]\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Counties of Ireland|County]]\n|subdivision_name2      = [[South Dublin]]\n|subdivision_type3      = [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]\n|subdivision_name3      = [[Dublin Mid-West  (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Mid-West]]\n|subdivision_type4      = [[European Parliament]]\n|subdivision_name4      = [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]]\n|established_title      = \n|established_date       = \n|unit_pref              = Metric\n|area_footnotes         = \n|area_total_km2         = \n|population_as_of       = 2016\n|population_footnotes   = \n|population_total       = \n|population_urban       = 11130\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|timezone1              = [[West European Time|WET]] \n|utc_offset1            = +0\n|timezone1_DST          = [[Irish Standard Time|IST]] ([[Western European Summer Time|WEST]]) \n|utc_offset1_DST        = -1\n|coordinates            = {{coord|53.35|-6.379|dim:100000_region:IE|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    = <ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/EI/7/Palmerston.html Maps, Weather, and Airports for Palmerston, Ireland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|elevation_m            = 17\n|blank_name             = [[Irish grid reference system|Irish Grid Reference]]\n|blank_info             = {{iem4ibx|O082345}}\n|website                = {{URL|www.sdcc.ie}}\n|footnotes              = \n}}\n'''Palmerstown''' ({{Irish place name|Baile Ph\u00e1mar}}) is a [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and suburb in [[South Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Much of Palmerstown has been developed for residential, transportation and commercial purposes over the last half century. [[Townland]]s include:<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Palmerstown&streets=no Placenames Database of Ireland] - Palmerstown townlands</ref>\n* Palmerston Lower \n* Palmerston Upper \n* Irishtown\n* Saint Laurence\n* Johnstown\n* Palmerstown Manor\n* Yellow Walls\n* Fonthill\n* Redcowfarm\n* Woodfarm \n* Quarryvale\n* Brooklawn\n* Liffey Valley \n===Palmerstown village===\n[[Image:Stewarts Hospital.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The main building of Stewartscare and HSE from Mill Lane.]]\n[[Image:PalmerstownChurch.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The church in Palmerstown village.]]\nThe townlands of Palmerstown Upper and Palmerstown Lower straddle the old Lucan Road which was the ancient western highway. Many of Palmerstown's local amenities are located in a cluster along the road. Robin Villas and Hollyville were labourers' cottages built at the beginning of the last century. The old national school is now a community centre. Stewarts Hospital, (formerly the residence of the [[Earl of Donoughmore|Hely-Hutchinson]] family, the Roman Catholic Church of St. Philomena, the National School, the Palmerstown House Pub and Restaurant and a variety of general enterprises, including a bank and convenience stores are located here. [[Stewartscare]] is a health care facility at the Stewarts buildings and grounds which overlook the meandering Liffey valley. The Stewarts complex houses the administration of the Irish [[Health Service Executive]]. Stewarts Sports and Leisure centre is open to the general public. It also hosts an annual summer camp.\n\n===Redcow Farm===\n[[Image:Glenaulin Park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Glenaulin Park, adjacent to St. Patrick's GAA Club and home to many local sports fixtures]]\nThis area was the location of the first modern housing development in Palmerstown, constructed between 1955 and 1965. Centred on Manor road, this area contains several shops, the local credit union and a doctor's surgery. To the east of Redcow Farm, adjacent to the California Hills Park, is Glenaulin Sports Park, home of [[St. Patricks GAA Palmerstown|St. Patricks GAA club]].\nThe name 'California Hill' was given, by the children of the area, to a small wasteland to the East of Glenaulin Park, which had been a builder\u2019s dump during the construction of the main Palmerstown Estate in the mid to late 60's. The wasteland had a series of small hills which were in fact mounds of builders rubble which had been buried under clay and eventually over grown with wild grass. The children of the area sometimes shortened the name to 'The Caliers' and this name is also still in use today. The hills or mounds were flattened some years ago and the area landscaped for communal/public use.\n\n===Palmerston Lower===\nMill Lane leads to the original Palmerstown settlement and centre of industry, which once employed over 600 millhands, craftsmen, and labourers. This seventeenth-century low-lying waterside industrial village was complete with flax, seed, oil, and flour mills. The ruin of a pre-Norman church and the remains of the once prosperous thriving community are situated near the river. A small ferry crossed the Liffey here, to where the Wren's Nest pub was situated on the North side. A football ground opposite the river Liffey is home to [[Palmerstown F.C.]] Muhammad Ali visited Stewarts Hospital on the 15th of July 1972 when the hospital was hosting its annual sporting fete.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comeheretome.com/2016/06/09/when-muhammad-ali-came-to-palmerstown/|title=When Muhammad Ali came to Palmerstown.|date=2016-06-09|website=Come Here To Me!|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Palmerstown Manor===\nPalmerstown's largest housing estate was built in the early 1990s in the south east of the area. Adjacent to the Coldcut and Kennelsfort roads and the M50 motorway, the estate marks the 'border' between Palmerstown with [[Ballyfermot]] and [[Clondalkin]].\n\n===Woodfarm Acres===\nThe townland of Woodfarm Acres was mostly farmland, with a few council cottages previously existed on the site. This housing development was built during the 1970s. The estate is bounded by the M50 motorway and N4. Adjacent to Woodfarm Acres is another shopping centre containing a local [[SuperValu (Ireland)|SuperValu]] market, a bowling alley and other amenities. Access to the local cemetery is adjacent to this centre. The Silver Granite Pub is located nearby, as is ''Pobalscoil Isolde'', a secondary-level community school which opened in the 1980s.\n\n===Oakcourt===\nThe Oakcourt housing estate lies in the western part of the 59-acre Johnstown townland, behind Pobalscoil Iosolde. It was originally developed in the 1970s, and expanded in the mid-1990s. The Johnstown townland extends due west from the Georgian Johnstown House (now St. John's College) on Le Fanu Rd. It runs west to Kennelsfort Road and lies between St. Laurence townland (the St. Laurence House is now the West County Hotel) from the River Liffey and Chapelizod in the north, to Ballyfermot Upper/Blackditch on the south.\n\n==Transport==\nThe main public transport is Dublin Bus running via the N4 at Palmerstown village. Scheduled services run east to the city and west to [[Lucan]], [[Celbridge]], [[Leixlip]] and [[Maynooth]]. Route 26 operates from travels from Woodfarm Acres to Dublin city via Kennelsfort Road. Route 18, a circular city route runs from the Old Lucan Road to [[Sandymount]] Green via many south Dublin suburbs including [[Walkinstown]], [[Crumlin, Dublin|Crumlin]] and [[Rathgar]]. Route 40 operates via the Coldcut road to [[Finglas]] via Dublin city. Routes 67, 66, 66a, 66b, 25, 25a and 25b operates via the Chapelizod Bypass to [[Merrion Square]] via Dublin City.\nPalmerstown railway station on the [[Dublin and Lucan tramway]], later part of the [[Dublin United Transport Company]] tram system, opened in November 1881 and closed on 13 April 1940.<ref>{{cite web | title=Palmerstown station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-11-22|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Palmerstown Cemetery==\nPalmerstown Cemetery was originally opened in 1978. It is located on Kennelsfort Road, adjacent to Woodfarm Acres. It is currently being managed as part of the Glasnevin Trust.<ref>http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/funeral-services/palmerstown-cemetery/ Glasnevin Trust</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of towns and villages in the Republic of Ireland]]\n\n==Footnote==\n{{Reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.southdublinhistory.ie South Dublin County History]\n*[http://www.southdublinimages.ie South Dublin County Images]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404064257/http://prfc.ie/ Palmerstown Rangers Football Club Website]\n*[http://www.stpatricksgaa.ie St Patricks GAA Hurling, Football and Camogie Club Website]\n\n{{Dublin residential areas}}\n\n[[Category:Palmerstown|  ]]\n[[Category:Towns and villages in South Dublin (county)]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes of County Dublin]]\n", "name_user": "92.251.248.223", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerstown"}

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick.

The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time. The winner of the Augusta National Women's Amateur is exempt from two women's golf majors.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/masters-2018-augusta-national-womens-amateur-championship-to-debut-in-2019 |title=Masters 2018: Augusta National Women's Amateur Championship to debut in 2019 |last=Herrington |first=Ryan |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.golfchannel.com/news/six-players-including-arizonas-yu-sang-hou-complete-augusta-national-womens-amateur-field |title=Six players, including Arizona's Yu-Sang Hou, complete Augusta National Women's Amateur field |work=Golf Channel |access-date=2019-02-03 |first=Brentley |last=Romine |date=January 28, 2019 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Par-3 contest===\n{{main|Masters Tournament Par-3 contest}}\n[[File:The Masters.jpg|thumb|The 9th hole on the par 3 course.]]\nThe Par 3 Contest was first introduced in 1960, and was won that year by Snead.

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot.

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

They are planning to carve an open pit mine over [[pegmatite]] dikes. (The pegmatite is about 1% lithium carbonate.) The mine is about {{convert|60|km|mi}} north of Val-d'Or, {{convert|38|km|mi}} southeast of Amos, and {{convert|15|km|mi}} km west of [[Barraute, Quebec|Barraute]].

Abitibi itself was then annexed to the province in Quebec on June 13, 1898, by an act of the federal Parliament.\n\nAmos was the first colonisation point for the region of [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue|Abitibi]], with colonization beginning in 1910. The municipality was established in 1914 while the city itself was chartered in 1925. The name of the city came from the maiden name of the wife of Sir [[Lomer Gouin]], then premier of Quebec.\n\nA related municipality was created in 1917 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie ouest des cantons unis de Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the western part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier) which changed its name to Amos-Ouest in 1949. In 1974 the municipality fused with the city of Amos proper. Another related municipality was created in 1918 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie est des cantons Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the eastern part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier), which also changed its name later 1950 to Amos-Est. The municipality was finally integrated into the city of Amos itself in 1987.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin-09-08-2014-4.JPG|thumb|left|Former mayor Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin during an event associated with Amos' centennial celebration.]]\nThe current mayor of the city is S\u00e9bastien D'Astous, who took office on February 20, 2015, after winning a [[by-election]]<ref>[http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois \"D'Astous gagne le c\u0153ur des Amossois\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216085351/http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois |date=2015-02-16 }}.

It is the seat of [[Abitibi Regional County Municipality]].\n\nAmos is the main town on the Harricana River, and the smallest of the three primary towns \u2014 after [[Rouyn-Noranda]] and [[Val-d'Or]] \u2014 in the [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] region of Quebec. Its main resources are spring water, gold and [[wood]] products, including [[paper]]. In 2012, Quebec Lithium Corp. re-opened Canada's first [[lithium]] mine, which had operated as an underground mine from 1955&ndash;65. They are planning to carve an open pit mine over [[pegmatite]] dikes. (The pegmatite is about 1% lithium carbonate.) The mine is about {{convert|60|km|mi}} north of Val-d'Or, {{convert|38|km|mi}} southeast of Amos, and {{convert|15|km|mi}} km west of [[Barraute, Quebec|Barraute]]. It is in the northeast corner of [[La Corne, Quebec|La Corne]] Township. Access to the mine is via paved road from Val d'Or.<ref name=CanLith>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.canadalithium.com/s/QuebecLithium.asp\n |accessdate   = 2013-03-07\n |title        = Quebec Lithium\n |publisher    = Canada Lithium Corp.\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130310044550/http://www.canadalithium.com/s/QuebecLithium.asp\n |archive-date = 2013-03-10\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller communities of Lac-Gauvin and Saint-Maurice-de-Dalquier are also within the municipal boundaries of Amos.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:\u00c9glise d'Amos.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[St. Teresa of Avila Cathedral, Amos|The Amos Roman Catholic Cathedral]]]]\n[[Rupert's Land]], in which Abitibi was located, was owned by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and was bought by Canada in 1869. Abitibi itself was then annexed to the province in Quebec on June 13, 1898, by an act of the federal Parliament.\n\nAmos was the first colonisation point for the region of [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue|Abitibi]], with colonization beginning in 1910. The municipality was established in 1914 while the city itself was chartered in 1925. The name of the city came from the maiden name of the wife of Sir [[Lomer Gouin]], then premier of Quebec.\n\nA related municipality was created in 1917 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie ouest des cantons unis de Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the western part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier) which changed its name to Amos-Ouest in 1949. In 1974 the municipality fused with the city of Amos proper. Another related municipality was created in 1918 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie est des cantons Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the eastern part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier), which also changed its name later 1950 to Amos-Est. The municipality was finally integrated into the city of Amos itself in 1987.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin-09-08-2014-4.JPG|thumb|left|Former mayor Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin during an event associated with Amos' centennial celebration.]]\nThe current mayor of the city is S\u00e9bastien D'Astous, who took office on February 20, 2015, after winning a [[by-election]]<ref>[http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois \"D'Astous gagne le c\u0153ur des Amossois\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216085351/http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois |date=2015-02-16 }}.
