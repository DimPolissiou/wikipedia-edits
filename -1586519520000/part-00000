He was introduced in the first-season episode \"Maximum Security\" of ''[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]'' as Major \"Willi\" Schaeffer, the alcoholic second-in-command of the Kommandant ([[Bernard Hepton]]). In the [[Ian Curteis]] television play ''Suez 1956'' (1979), he portrayed Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]]. In 1981, he was reunited with [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Granada Television]]'s ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', portraying the doctor to Olivier's dying Lord Marchmain. Gough also appeared in ''[[The Citadel (television)|The Citadel]]'' (1983) as Sir Jenner Halliday, in 1985's ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' as [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|Lord Delamere]] and as the fictional deposed KGB spymaster Andrei Zorin in ''[[Sleepers (TV series)|Sleepers]]''.\n\n==Later roles==\nHis later roles included [[Alfred Pennyworth]] for [[Tim Burton]], including ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).
