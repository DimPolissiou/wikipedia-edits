{"title_page": "Copenhagen Consensus", "text_new": "{{short description|Welfare economics project}}\n'''Copenhagen Consensus''' is a project that seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]], using cost\u2013benefit analysis. It was conceived<ref>[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/about Copenhagen Consensus 2004 \u2013 addresses 10 major challenges in the world. \u2013 The Basic Idea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and organized by [[Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg]], the author of ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' and the then director of the Danish government's [[Environmental Assessment Institute]].\n\nThe project is run by the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]],<ref>http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com Copenhagen Consensus Center \u2013 CCC Home Page</ref> which is directed by Lomborg and was part of the [[Copenhagen Business School]], but it is now an independent [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organisation]] registered in the USA. The project considers possible solutions to a wide range of problems, presented by experts in each field. These are evaluated and ranked by a panel of economists. The emphasis is on rational prioritization by economic analysis. The panel is given an arbitrary budget constraint and instructed to use cost\u2013benefit analysis to focus on a bottom line approach in solving/ranking presented problems. The approach is justified as a corrective to standard practice in [[international development]], where, it is alleged, media attention and the \"court of public opinion\" results in priorities that are often far from optimal.\n\n==History==\nThe project has held conferences in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The 2012 conference ranked bundled [[micronutrient]] interventions the highest priority,<ref name=\"CC12 Outcome\">{{cite web|title=CC12 Outcome|url=http://copenhagenconsensus.com/projects/copenhagen-consensus-2012/outcome}}</ref> and the 2008 report identified [[supplementing vitamins]] for undernourished children as the world\u2019s best investment.<ref>[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/projects/copenhagen-consensus-2008 Copenhagen Consensus 2008 \u2013 The world\u2019s best investment: Vitamins for undernourished children]</ref> The 2009 conference, dealing specifically with [[global warming]], proposed research into [[cloud reflectivity modification|marine cloud whitening]] (ships spraying seawater into clouds to make them reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperature) as the top climate change priority, though climate change itself is ranked well below other world problems. In 2011 the Copenhagen Consensus Center carried out the Rethink HIV project together with the RUSH Foundation, to find smart solutions to the problem of [[HIV/AIDS]]. In 2007 looked into which projects would contribute most to welfare in Copenhagen Consensus for Latin America in cooperation with the [[Inter-American Development Bank]].\n\nThe initial project was co-sponsored by the Danish government and ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the Copenhagen Consensus 2004 conclusions, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]], followed by the second edition published in 2009 based on the 2008 conclusions. The book containing the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 research and outcomes is in the process of publication.\n\n==Copenhagen Consensus 2012==\nIn May 2012, the third global Copenhagen Consensus<ref>Copenhagen Consensus 2012</ref> was held, gathering economists to analyze the costs and benefits of different approaches to tackling the world\u2018s biggest problems. The aim was to provide an answer to the question:\nIf you had $75bn for worthwhile causes, where should you start?\nA panel including four Nobel laureates met in Copenhagen, Denmark, in May 2012. The panel\u2019s deliberations were informed by thirty new economic research papers that were written just for the project by scholars from around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Copenhagen Consensus 2012|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/copenhagen-consensus-2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Economists ===\nThe panel members were the following, four of whom are [[List of Nobel laureates in Economics|Nobel Laureate economists]].\n* [[Robert Mundell]]\n* [[Nancy Stokey]]\n* [[Thomas Schelling]]\n* [[Vernon L.

The process was similar to the 2004 and 2008 Copenhagen Consensus, involving papers by specialists considered by a panel of economists. The panel ranked 15 solutions, of which the top 5 were:\n# Research into marine cloud whitening (involving ships spraying sea-water into clouds so as to reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperatures)\n# Technology-led policy response\n# Research into stratospheric aerosol injection (involving injected ?sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to reduce sunlight)\n# Research into carbon storage\n# Planning for adaptation\n\nThe benefits of the number 1 solution are that if the research proved successful this solution could be deployed relatively cheaply and quickly. Potential problems include environmental impacts e.g. from changing rainfall patterns.\n\nMeasures to cut [[CO2 emissions|carbon]] and [[methane emissions]], such as [[carbon tax]]es, came bottom of the results list, partly because they would take a long time to have much effect on temperatures.\n\n==Copenhagen Consensus 2004==\n\n=== Process ===\nEight economists met May 24\u201328, 2004 at a roundtable in [[Copenhagen]]. A series of background papers had been prepared in advance to summarize the current knowledge about the welfare economics of 32 proposals (\"opportunities\") from 10 categories (\"challenges\"). For each category, one assessment article and two critiques were produced. After a closed-door review of the background papers, each of the participants gave economic priority rankings to 17 of the proposals (the rest were deemed inconclusive).\n\n=== Economists ===\n''[[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize]] winners marked with (''\u00a4'')''\n* [[Jagdish Bhagwati]]\n* [[Robert Fogel]] (\u00a4)\n* [[Bruno Frey]]\n* [[Justin Yifu Lin]]\n* [[Douglass North]] (\u00a4)\n* [[Thomas Schelling]] (\u00a4)\n* [[Vernon L.

The rated opportunities were further classified into four groups: Very Good, Good, Fair and Bad; all results are based using cost\u2013benefit analysis.\n\n====Very good====\nThe highest priority was assigned to implementing certain new measures to prevent the spread of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]]. The economists estimated that an investment of $27 billion could avert nearly 30 million new infections by 2010.\n\nPolicies to reduce malnutrition and hunger were chosen as the second priority. Increasing the availability of [[micronutrient]]s, particularly reducing [[iron deficiency anemia]] through [[dietary supplement]]s, was judged to have an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to costs, which were estimated at $12 billion.\n\n[[File:AnophelesGambiaemosquito.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Control malaria]]\nThird on the list was [[free trade|trade liberalization]]; the experts agreed that modest costs could yield large benefits for the world as a whole and for [[developing nation]]s.\n\nThe fourth priority identified was controlling and treating [[malaria]]; $13 billion costs were judged to produce very good benefits, particularly if applied toward chemically-treated [[mosquito]] netting for beds.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/110312.html Search \u2013 International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Good====\nThe fifth priority identified was increased spending on [[International agricultural research|research into new agricultural technologies]] appropriate for developing nations.  Three proposals for improving sanitation and water quality for a billion of the world\u2019s poorest followed in priority (ranked sixth to eighth: small-scale water technology for livelihoods, community-managed water supply and sanitation, and research on water productivity in food production). Completing this group was the 'government' project concerned with lowering the cost of starting new businesses.\n\n====Fair====\nRanked tenth was the project on lowering barriers to migration for [[skilled worker]]s. Eleventh and twelfth on the list were malnutrition projects \u2013 improving infant and child nutrition and reducing the prevalence of [[low birth weight]]. Ranked thirteenth was the plan for scaled-up basic health services to fight diseases.\n\n====Poor====\nRanked fourteenth to seventeenth were: a migration project (guest-worker programmes for the unskilled), which was deemed to discourage integration; and three projects addressing climate change ([[optimal carbon tax]], the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and [[value-at-risk carbon tax]]), which the panel judged to be least cost-efficient of the proposals.\n\n=== Global warming ===\n\nThe panel found that all three climate policies presented have \"costs that were likely to exceed the benefits\". It further stated \"global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift toward lower emissions of carbon are needlessly expensive.\" <ref>http://copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CC04-final_result.pdf</ref>\n\nIn regard to the science of global warming, the paper presented by Cline relied primarily on the framework set by [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and accepted the consensus view on global warming that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary cause of the global warming.  Cline relies on various research studies published in the field of economics and attempted to compare the estimated cost of mitigation policies against the expected reduction in the damage of the global warming.\n\nCline used a discount rate of 1.5%. (Cline's summary is on the project webpage <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/research/climate-change-and-energy Copenhagen Consensus 2004 \u2013 addresses 10 major challenges in the world. \u2013 Climate Change<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>)  He justified his choice of discount rate on the ground of \"utility-based discounting\", that is there is zero bias in terms of preference between the present and the [[future generation]] (see [[time preference]]). Moreover, Cline extended the time frame of the analysis to three hundred years in the future. Because the expected net damage of the global warming becomes more apparent beyond the present generation(s), this choice had the effect of increasing the present-value cost of the damage of global warming as well as the benefit of abatement policies.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nMembers of the panel including Thomas Schelling and one of the two perspective paper writers [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] (both opponents of the Kyoto protocol) criticised Cline, mainly on the issue of discount rates. (See \"The opponent notes to the paper on Climate Change\" <ref name=autogenerated3 />) Mendelsohn, in particular, characterizing Cline's position, said that \"[i]f we use a large discount rate, they will be judged to be small effects\" and called it \"circular reasoning, not a justification\". Cline responded to this by arguing that there is no obvious reason to use a large discount rate just because this is what is usually done in economic analysis. In other words, climate change ought to be treated differently from other, more imminent problems.  The Economist quoted Mendelsohn as worrying that \"climate change was [[setting up to fail|set up to fail]]\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3630425 | work=The Economist | title=Hotting up | date=2005-02-04}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Mendelsohn argued that Cline's damage estimates were excessive. Citing various recent articles, including some of his own, he stated that \"[a] series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits.\"\n\nMembers of the panel, including Schelling, criticised the way this issue was handled in the Consensus project.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe 2004 Copenhagen Consensus attracted various criticisms:\n\n===Approach and alleged bias===\n\nThe 2004 report, especially its conclusion regarding climate change was subsequently criticised from a variety of perspectives. The general approach adopted to set priorities was criticised by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], an American economist and advocate of both the Kyoto protocol <ref>[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs105 Project Syndicate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and increased development aid, who argued that the analytical framework was inappropriate and biased and that the project \"failed to mobilize an expert group that could credibly identify and communicate a true consensus of expert knowledge on the range of issues under consideration.\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/430725a Citation Results : Nature<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTom Burke, a former director of Friends of the Earth, repudiated the entire approach of the project, arguing that applying cost\u2013benefit analysis in the way the Copenhagen panel did was  \"junk economics\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1334209,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=This is neither scepticism nor science \u2013 just nonsense | date=2004-10-23 | accessdate=2010-04-30 | first=Tom | last=Burke}}</ref>\n\n[[John Quiggin]], an Australian economics professor, commented that the project is a mix of \"a substantial contribution to our understanding of important issues facing the world\" and an \"exercises in political propaganda\" and argued that the selection of the panel members was slanted towards the conclusions previously supported by Lomborg.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">[http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2005/01/21/copenhagen-review/ Copenhagen review at John Quiggin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Quiggin observed that Lomborg had argued in his controversial book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' that resources allocated to mitigating global warming would be better spent on improving water quality and sanitation, and was therefore seen as having prejudged the issues.\n\nUnder the heading \"Wrong Question\", Sachs further argued that: \"The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus was asked to allocate an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world\u2019s biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum \u2014 a tiny fraction of global income \u2014 the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services.\"\n\nIn response Lomborg argued that $50 billion was \"an optimistic but realistic example of actual spending.\" \"Experience shows that pledges and actual spending are two different things. In 1970 the UN set itself the task of doubling development assistance. Since then the percentage has actually \nbeen dropping\". \"But even if Sachs or others could gather much more than $50 billion over the next 4 years, the Copenhagen Consensus priority list would still show us where it should be invested first.\"  <ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/projects/copenhagen-consensus-2004/outcome Copenhagen Consensus 2004 \u2013 addresses 10 major challenges in the world. \u2013 Press releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOne of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced himself from the way in which the Consensus results have been interpreted in the wider debate. [[Thomas Schelling]] now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.\n<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PGNPNNV | work=The Economist | title=Hotting up | date=2005-02-03}}</ref>\n\nMichael Grubb, an economist and lead author for several [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, commented on the Copenhagen Consensus, writing:<ref name=\"grubbm\">{{cite web\n|date=9 March 2005\n|title=House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs Minutes of Evidence.

This way of posing the question is both morally inappropriate and irrelevant to the determination of real climate mitigation policy.</blockquote>\n\n===Panel membership===\n\nQuiggin argued that the members of the 2004 panel, selected by Lomborg, were \"generally towards the right and, to the extent that they had stated views, to be opponents of Kyoto.\"<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Sachs also noted that the panel members had not previously been much involved in issues of [[development economics]] and were unlikely to reach useful conclusions in the time available to them.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Commenting on the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus, [[climatologist]] and IPCC author [[Stephen Schneider]] criticised Lomborg for only inviting economists to participate:<ref name=\"schneiders\">{{cite web\n|date=n.d.\n|title=Climate Science: Contrarians.\n|publisher=Stephen Schneider's website\n|author=Schneider, S.\n|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/CliSciFrameset.html\n|accessdate=2009-02-07\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185204/http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/CliSciFrameset.html\n|archive-date=2008-05-11\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n<blockquote>In order to achieve a true consensus, I think Lomborg would've had to invite ecologists, social scientists concerned with justice and how climate change impacts and policies are often inequitably distributed, philosophers who could challenge the economic paradigm of \"one dollar, one vote\" implicit in cost\u2013benefit analyses promoted by economists, and [[climate scientist]]s who could easily show that Lomborg's claim that climate change will have only minimal effects is not sound science.</blockquote>\n\nLomborg countered criticism of the panel membership by stating that \"Sachs disparaged the Consensus 'dream team' because it only consisted of economists.

It was conceived<ref>[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/about Copenhagen Consensus 2004 \u2013 addresses 10 major challenges in the world. \u2013 The Basic Idea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and organized by [[Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg]], the author of ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' and the then director of the Danish government's [[Environmental Assessment Institute]].\n\nThe project is run by the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]],<ref>http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com Copenhagen Consensus Center \u2013 CCC Home Page</ref> which is directed by Lomborg and was part of the [[Copenhagen Business School]], but it is now an independent [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organisation]] registered in the USA. The project considers possible solutions to a wide range of problems, presented by experts in each field. These are evaluated and ranked by a panel of economists. The emphasis is on rational prioritization by economic analysis. The panel is given an arbitrary budget constraint and instructed to use cost\u2013benefit analysis to focus on a bottom line approach in solving/ranking presented problems. The approach is justified as a corrective to standard practice in [[international development]], where, it is alleged, media attention and the \"court of public opinion\" results in priorities that are often far from optimal.\n\n==History==\nThe project has held conferences in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012.

In 2011 the Copenhagen Consensus Center carried out the Rethink HIV project together with the RUSH Foundation, to find smart solutions to the problem of [[HIV/AIDS]]. In 2007 looked into which projects would contribute most to welfare in Copenhagen Consensus for Latin America in cooperation with the [[Inter-American Development Bank]].\n\nThe initial project was co-sponsored by the Danish government and ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the Copenhagen Consensus 2004 conclusions, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]], followed by the second edition published in 2009 based on the 2008 conclusions.

Within each challenge, 3\u20134 opportunities (proposals) were analyzed:\n[[File:HIV-budding-Color.jpg|thumb|180px|Preventing spread of HIV]]\n* [[Infectious disease|Communicable diseases]] ([[Anne Mills]])\n* [[Armed conflict|Conflicts]] ([[Paul Collier]])\n* [[Education]] ([[Lant Pritchett]])\n* [[Currency crisis|Financial instability]] ([[Barry Eichengreen]])\n* [[Global Warming]] sometimes also called Climate change ([[William R. Cline]])\n* [[Government]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]] ([[Susan Rose-Ackerman]])\n* [[Malnutrition]] and [[hunger]] ([[Jere Behrman]])\n* [[Population]]: [[Human migration|migration]] ([[Phillip L. Martin]])\n* [[Sanitation]] and [[water#Water rights and development|water]] ([[Frank Rijsberman]])\n* [[subsidy|Subsidies]] and [[trade barrier]]s ([[Kym Anderson]])\n\n=== Results ===\nThe panel agreed to rate seventeen of the thirty-two opportunities within seven of the ten challenges. The rated opportunities were further classified into four groups: Very Good, Good, Fair and Bad; all results are based using cost\u2013benefit analysis.\n\n====Very good====\nThe highest priority was assigned to implementing certain new measures to prevent the spread of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]]. The economists estimated that an investment of $27 billion could avert nearly 30 million new infections by 2010.\n\nPolicies to reduce malnutrition and hunger were chosen as the second priority. Increasing the availability of [[micronutrient]]s, particularly reducing [[iron deficiency anemia]] through [[dietary supplement]]s, was judged to have an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to costs, which were estimated at $12 billion.\n\n[[File:AnophelesGambiaemosquito.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Control malaria]]\nThird on the list was [[free trade|trade liberalization]]; the experts agreed that modest costs could yield large benefits for the world as a whole and for [[developing nation]]s.\n\nThe fourth priority identified was controlling and treating [[malaria]]; $13 billion costs were judged to produce very good benefits, particularly if applied toward chemically-treated [[mosquito]] netting for beds.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/110312.html Search \u2013 International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Good====\nThe fifth priority identified was increased spending on [[International agricultural research|research into new agricultural technologies]] appropriate for developing nations.  Three proposals for improving sanitation and water quality for a billion of the world\u2019s poorest followed in priority (ranked sixth to eighth: small-scale water technology for livelihoods, community-managed water supply and sanitation, and research on water productivity in food production). Completing this group was the 'government' project concerned with lowering the cost of starting new businesses.\n\n====Fair====\nRanked tenth was the project on lowering barriers to migration for [[skilled worker]]s. Eleventh and twelfth on the list were malnutrition projects \u2013 improving infant and child nutrition and reducing the prevalence of [[low birth weight]]. Ranked thirteenth was the plan for scaled-up basic health services to fight diseases.\n\n====Poor====\nRanked fourteenth to seventeenth were: a migration project (guest-worker programmes for the unskilled), which was deemed to discourage integration; and three projects addressing climate change ([[optimal carbon tax]], the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and [[value-at-risk carbon tax]]), which the panel judged to be least cost-efficient of the proposals.\n\n=== Global warming ===\n\nThe panel found that all three climate policies presented have \"costs that were likely to exceed the benefits\". It further stated \"global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift toward lower emissions of carbon are needlessly expensive.\" <ref>http://copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CC04-final_result.pdf</ref>\n\nIn regard to the science of global warming, the paper presented by Cline relied primarily on the framework set by [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and accepted the consensus view on global warming that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary cause of the global warming.  Cline relies on various research studies published in the field of economics and attempted to compare the estimated cost of mitigation policies against the expected reduction in the damage of the global warming.\n\nCline used a discount rate of 1.5%. (Cline's summary is on the project webpage <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/research/climate-change-and-energy Copenhagen Consensus 2004 \u2013 addresses 10 major challenges in the world. \u2013 Climate Change<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>)  He justified his choice of discount rate on the ground of \"utility-based discounting\", that is there is zero bias in terms of preference between the present and the [[future generation]] (see [[time preference]]). Moreover, Cline extended the time frame of the analysis to three hundred years in the future. Because the expected net damage of the global warming becomes more apparent beyond the present generation(s), this choice had the effect of increasing the present-value cost of the damage of global warming as well as the benefit of abatement policies.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nMembers of the panel including Thomas Schelling and one of the two perspective paper writers [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] (both opponents of the Kyoto protocol) criticised Cline, mainly on the issue of discount rates. (See \"The opponent notes to the paper on Climate Change\" <ref name=autogenerated3 />) Mendelsohn, in particular, characterizing Cline's position, said that \"[i]f we use a large discount rate, they will be judged to be small effects\" and called it \"circular reasoning, not a justification\". Cline responded to this by arguing that there is no obvious reason to use a large discount rate just because this is what is usually done in economic analysis. In other words, climate change ought to be treated differently from other, more imminent problems.  The Economist quoted Mendelsohn as worrying that \"climate change was [[setting up to fail|set up to fail]]\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3630425 | work=The Economist | title=Hotting up | date=2005-02-04}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Mendelsohn argued that Cline's damage estimates were excessive. Citing various recent articles, including some of his own, he stated that \"[a] series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits.\"\n\nMembers of the panel, including Schelling, criticised the way this issue was handled in the Consensus project.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe 2004 Copenhagen Consensus attracted various criticisms:\n\n===Approach and alleged bias===\n\nThe 2004 report, especially its conclusion regarding climate change was subsequently criticised from a variety of perspectives. The general approach adopted to set priorities was criticised by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], an American economist and advocate of both the Kyoto protocol <ref>[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs105 Project Syndicate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and increased development aid, who argued that the analytical framework was inappropriate and biased and that the project \"failed to mobilize an expert group that could credibly identify and communicate a true consensus of expert knowledge on the range of issues under consideration.\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/430725a Citation Results : Nature<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTom Burke, a former director of Friends of the Earth, repudiated the entire approach of the project, arguing that applying cost\u2013benefit analysis in the way the Copenhagen panel did was  \"junk economics\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1334209,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=This is neither scepticism nor science \u2013 just nonsense | date=2004-10-23 | accessdate=2010-04-30 | first=Tom | last=Burke}}</ref>\n\n[[John Quiggin]], an Australian economics professor, commented that the project is a mix of \"a substantial contribution to our understanding of important issues facing the world\" and an \"exercises in political propaganda\" and argued that the selection of the panel members was slanted towards the conclusions previously supported by Lomborg.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">[http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2005/01/21/copenhagen-review/ Copenhagen review at John Quiggin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Quiggin observed that Lomborg had argued in his controversial book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' that resources allocated to mitigating global warming would be better spent on improving water quality and sanitation, and was therefore seen as having prejudged the issues.\n\nUnder the heading \"Wrong Question\", Sachs further argued that: \"The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus was asked to allocate an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world\u2019s biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum \u2014 a tiny fraction of global income \u2014 the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services.\"\n\nIn response Lomborg argued that $50 billion was \"an optimistic but realistic example of actual spending.\" \"Experience shows that pledges and actual spending are two different things. In 1970 the UN set itself the task of doubling development assistance. Since then the percentage has actually \nbeen dropping\". \"But even if Sachs or others could gather much more than $50 billion over the next 4 years, the Copenhagen Consensus priority list would still show us where it should be invested first.\"  <ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://copenhagenconsensus.com/projects/copenhagen-consensus-2004/outcome Copenhagen Consensus 2004 \u2013 addresses 10 major challenges in the world. \u2013 Press releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOne of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced himself from the way in which the Consensus results have been interpreted in the wider debate. [[Thomas Schelling]] now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist [[Robert O. Mendelsohn]] was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.\n<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PGNPNNV | work=The Economist | title=Hotting up | date=2005-02-03}}</ref>\n\nMichael Grubb, an economist and lead author for several [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, commented on the Copenhagen Consensus, writing:<ref name=\"grubbm\">{{cite web\n|date=9 March 2005\n|title=House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs Minutes of Evidence.

No government is proposing that the [[marginal cost]]s associated with, for example, an [[emissions trading]] system, should be deducted from its [[foreign aid]] budget. This way of posing the question is both morally inappropriate and irrelevant to the determination of real climate mitigation policy.</blockquote>\n\n===Panel membership===\n\nQuiggin argued that the members of the 2004 panel, selected by Lomborg, were \"generally towards the right and, to the extent that they had stated views, to be opponents of Kyoto.\"<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Sachs also noted that the panel members had not previously been much involved in issues of [[development economics]] and were unlikely to reach useful conclusions in the time available to them.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Commenting on the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus, [[climatologist]] and IPCC author [[Stephen Schneider]] criticised Lomborg for only inviting economists to participate:<ref name=\"schneiders\">{{cite web\n|date=n.d.\n|title=Climate Science: Contrarians.\n|publisher=Stephen Schneider's website\n|author=Schneider, S.\n|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/CliSciFrameset.html\n|accessdate=2009-02-07\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185204/http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/CliSciFrameset.html\n|archive-date=2008-05-11\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n<blockquote>In order to achieve a true consensus, I think Lomborg would've had to invite ecologists, social scientists concerned with justice and how climate change impacts and policies are often inequitably distributed, philosophers who could challenge the economic paradigm of \"one dollar, one vote\" implicit in cost\u2013benefit analyses promoted by economists, and [[climate scientist]]s who could easily show that Lomborg's claim that climate change will have only minimal effects is not sound science.</blockquote>\n\nLomborg countered criticism of the panel membership by stating that \"Sachs disparaged the Consensus 'dream team' because it only consisted of economists. But that was the very point of the project. Economists have expertise in economic prioritization. It is they and not climatologists or malaria experts who can prioritize between battling global warming or communicable disease\".<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Copenhagen Diagnosis]]\n* [[UN Economic and Social Council]]\n* [[UN Human Development Index]]\n* [[Measuring well-being]]\n* [[Physical quality-of-life index]]\n* [[Environmental Economics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| last = Lomborg| first = Bjorn| title = How to Spend $50 Billion to Make the World a Better Place| year = 2006| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-68571-9 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Lomborg| first = Bj\u00f8rn| title = Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems: Costs and Benefits| year = 2007| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-71597-3 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Lomborg| first = Bj\u00f8rn| title = Global Crises, Global Solutions: Costs and Benefits| year = 2009| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-74122-4 }}\n* Sachs, Jeffrey D.
