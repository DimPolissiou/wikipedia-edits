The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Satellite state#Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Eastern Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Reunification Day|reunified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name.

In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function. Under socialism, it is not a \"government of people, but the administration of things\", thereby ceasing to be a state by the traditional definition.<ref>\"Withering away of the state\".

In order not to be overthrown once having conquered power, Engels argues that the working class \"must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any moment\".

Bernstein stated: \"The socialist movement is everything to me while what people commonly call the goal of Socialism is nothing\".<ref>[[Manfred Steger|Steger, Manfred]] (1996). ''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment.

He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Satellite state#Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Eastern Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Vietnamese reunification|re-unified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name.

In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function.

''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 371. {{ISBN|9780199585977}}.</ref> In this way, Lenin was thereby proposing a classically dynamic view of progressive social structure which during his own short period of governance emerged as a defensive and preliminary bureaucratic centralist stage. He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

They reason that a socialist state is antithetical to socialism and that socialism will emerge spontaneously from the [[grassroots]] level in an [[Evolutionary economics|evolutionary manner]], developing its own unique political and economic institutions for a highly organized [[stateless society]]. Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nIn late 2018 to early 2019, the band went for recording their debut album in a studio based in their hometown Ranchi. They were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants. The band was booked to judge Fuego of KIIT Fest 2019 in [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Highway 69 as the judges for Fuego.|url=https://www.facebook.com/kiitfest/photos/a.754450924636786/2076640085751190/|website=Facebook page of KIIT Fest|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Avalanche of [[Srijan]] 2019 in [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]] and twice at Rhapsody of Bitotsav 2019 and 2020 in [[Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The local metal band of Ranchi, Highway 69 performed in the Fusion Arena|url=https://bitmesra.ac.in/naps/11813-2/|website=NAPS of BIT Mesra|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> They even got headliner shows in [[Jorhat]], twice in [[Jalpaiguri]], opening for [[Jubin Nautiyal]], a Bollywood singer at [[Srijan]] of [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]], Bitotsav of [[Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Plethora of events enthuse participants at BITOTSAV 2020|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/plethora-of-events-enthuse-participants-at-bitotsav-2020.html|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and shows in Ranchi.<ref>{{cite web|title=State to celebrate its 19th year of foundation on November 15|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/state-to-celebrate-its-19th-year-of-foundation-on-november-15.html|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Despite their decision of 2018, which meant to not take part in any competitions, the band went to register for Wacken Metal Battle which is organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]]. It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nIn late 2018 to early 2019, the band went for recording their debut album in a studio based in their hometown Ranchi. They were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.
