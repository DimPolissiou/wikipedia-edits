Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. A \"[[Human rights|rights]] organization which has worked to denounce Saudi Arabia\u2019s abuses in northern Yemen\",<ref name=PressTV>{{cite news|title=Yemen's Houthis standing ground against Saudi Arabia |url= http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349604/houthis-stand-ground-against-s-arabia |work=Press TV| date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> the Asir Movement described itself as a \u201ccivil popular\u201d movement that seeks to raise \"internal Yemeni awareness\" about the situation and to explore legal remedies against Saudi Arabia \"for their involvement and assistance in abdicating Yemen\u2019s historical right to its territories\", all while emphasizing Yemeni unity.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]]. Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. A \"[[Human rights|rights]] organization which has worked to denounce Saudi Arabia\u2019s abuses in northern Yemen\",<ref name=PressTV>{{cite news|title=Yemen's Houthis standing ground against Saudi Arabia |url= http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349604/houthis-stand-ground-against-s-arabia |work=Press TV| date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> the Asir Movement described itself as a \u201ccivil popular\u201d movement that seeks to raise \"internal Yemeni awareness\" about the situation and to explore legal remedies against Saudi Arabia \"for their involvement and assistance in abdicating Yemen\u2019s historical right to its territories\", all while emphasizing Yemeni unity. The movement sought to speak out against the 2000 Jeddah border agreement as well as the 1934 Taif Agreement that was signed in 1934 to end the [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Jomana Farhat|title=Saudi-Yemeni Border: A Line in the Sand|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/8500|work=Al Akhbar|date=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Qatif conflict]] refers to the modern phase of [[sectarian]] tensions and violence in Eastern Arabia between Arab Shi'a Muslims and Arab Sunni majority, which has ruled Saudi Arabia since early 20th century.

In the present day, six [[Administrative divisions of Taiwan|province-level subdivisions]] ([[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]]) have been [[Secession|carved out of]] (seceded from) Taiwan Province (by the Taiwanese (ROC) government), and, therefore, Taiwan Province is ''de jure'' (under [[Law of Taiwan|Taiwanese (ROC) law]]) divided into seven distinct province-level subdivisions, including itself.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]]. Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".
