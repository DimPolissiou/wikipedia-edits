France]] and finished second in [[Ligue 1]], just three points away from title glory. However, manager Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107's second season at the club was not a success. From their opening Champions League [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group H|group stage]] 0\u20133 home loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], to their poor [[2004\u201305 Ligue 1|domestic form]], PSG never looked like replicating the winning form of the previous season. Going into the final round of Champions League group stage fixtures in December, the team still had a chance of advancing to the knockout stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=107183|title=After poor start, PSG still has hope|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=6 December 2004|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> The club, however, suffered a disappointing 1\u20133 defeat at home, courtesy of a [[Sergei Semak]] hat-trick, which meant straight elimination from Europe. It was a bitter loss that even prompted club president Francis Graille to publicly relay his disappointment at the \"lack of pride\" shown by the squad, though remaining guardedly coy when explicitly asked about Halilhod\u017ei\u0107's future at the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=107429|title=PSG boss wants answers after loss|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=8 December 2004|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nWith only domestic competition to worry about, PSG began 2005 looking to improve its league standing. Sluggish form continued, however, and on 8 February, following a 2\u20130 home defeat versus [[RC Lens|Lens]] that saw PSG drop to 12th, the club's management decided to sack Halilhod\u017ei\u0107.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=114234|title=Halilhodzic sacked as PSG coach|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=8 February 2005|accessdate=27 July

2014}}</ref> He was replaced by the coach of the reserves team, [[Laurent Fournier]], under whom the club eventually finished ninth in the league.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, Sochaux's
