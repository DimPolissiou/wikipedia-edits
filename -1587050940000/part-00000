Her parents are looking for a suitable groom for her. But due to her dark complexion, she is not able to get any groom. Mangesh, an arts student from the college accidentally meets her and she starts loving the fragrance that he brings with himself. She hears a rumour from her colleague that Mangesh is alcoholic and hence is drowsy in his classes and comes with red-eyes. One day she follows him to his home and then comes to know of the truth that Mangesh works in an [[incense stick]] factory at night. This explains the fragrance he brings and his drowsy look.

She is irritated by some disgusting smell that comes from the whole house. They both reminisce over the past and she has a thought of giving their marriage another chance. But the weird unknown smell keeps irritating her. Her irritation for the smell and Sarang's silence on how he turned out HIV+ turns her mad and she ransacks the whole house for the source of smell. She finally find a dead rat under the bed.

After reaching an agreement with his father, he agreed to continue his education on the condition that he be allowed to travel.  Dano served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]] where he attained the rank of Sergeant.  He was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Career==\nAn early acting effort saw Dano cast as McSnoyd the [[leprechaun]] in the stage show ''[[Barnaby (comics)#Theater|Barnaby and Mr. O'Malley]]'', based on the [[comic strip]] by [[Crockett Johnson]]. McSnoyd appears to the audience only as a blinking light on a large mushroom, so only his voice is heard.  However, at the conclusion of the show Dano joined the rest of the cast, wearing a leprechaun costume.\n\nDano is remembered for his supporting roles in a number of 1950s [[western (genre)|western]] and mystery films. The chance for the breakout role of a lifetime escaped him in the theatrical release of ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (1951 film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]''. Dano, cast as The Tattered Man, delivered such a disturbing performance in his death scene, according to director [[John Huston]], that the initial test audience left the theater in droves, e.g., \"I've never seen so many people get up and leave the theater...they liked no part of it.\" The death scene was lent a human touch by Dano, and in 1951, war-weary Americans rejected it (Huston: \"...[the audience rejection] was a pretty sickening event.\"). ''Red Badge'' was immediately recut, and the death scene was removed. It is long believed, and as early as Huston commenting in an interview in 1972, the scene has been lost (\"I doubt very much, whether the scene still exists.\").<ref>''The Dick Cavett Show'' (2/21/72)</ref> Dano was also cast in [[Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln|\"Mr. Lincoln\"]], a five-part TV episode appearing in 1952\u201353 on ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]''; in keeping with a Civil War theme, Dano portrayed Lincoln himself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omnibus: James Agee's Mr Lincoln and the Civil War (DVD)|publisher=Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.com/Omnibus-James-Agees-Lincoln-Civil/dp/B0091C21XM|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe often worked with [[Anthony Mann]] and [[James Stewart]]. He played Elijah in [[John Huston]]'s film version of ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'', intoning to [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, \"At sea one day, you'll smell land where there'll be no land, and on that day, Ahab will go to his grave, but he'll rise again within the hour.

In the [[black comedy]] ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'', directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he had a small but pivotal role as the officious Deputy Sheriff. Over the years, Dano made many television appearances, often in bizarre, macabre roles such as [[Richard Boone]]'s ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' and the [[NBC]] [[legal drama]] ''[[Justice (1954 TV series)|Justice]]'' starring [[Dane Clark]] and [[Gary Merrill]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Justice|publisher=The Classic TV Archive|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Legal/Justice.htm|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn December 2, 1957, Dano appeared as Wilbur English, a fearful man who kills a fellow gang member to collect the reward in the episode \"Cheyenne Express\" of [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s [[NBC]] western series, ''[[The Restless Gun]].'' Ultimately, his cowardice causes Wilbur's own accidental death.<ref>\"Cheyenne\", ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', [[DVD]], Timeless Media Group.</ref> Earlier that year, he had played \"Sageman\", a wizened mystic, in the 1957 ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' episode \"Shoot for the Moon\".<ref>{{cite web|title=''Father Knows Best'' &ndash; Shoot for the Moon|work=[[TV Guide]]|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/father-knows-best/shoot-for-the-moon-19270/|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> In the MGM Technicolor widescreen religious epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', Dano in 1961 played the role of [[Simon Peter]].\n\nIn 1960, Dano guest starred on [[David McLean (actor)|David McLean]]'s NBC summer western series, ''[[Tate (TV series)|Tate]]''. That same year, he portrayed Lucas Frome in the episode \"Black Harvest\" on [[Don Durant]]'s [[CBS]] western, ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]''. In 1962, he guest starred on the CBS [[anthology series]], ''[[The Lloyd Bridges Show]]''. Dano also appeared on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in five separate appearances from 1962\u201366 in a variety of character roles, one of the most memorable being \"Faraway MacPhail\". In 1962 Dano appeared as escaped convict Dan Molder on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the episode titled \"The Brazen Bell.\" In the 1965\u20131966 season, he guest starred on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s western series ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]''. He played an ex-con who became Northfork's pastor, and \"Honest Abe\" in 1961 episodes of ''[[The Rifleman]]'', an ABC Western series. He appeared on the series five times. Dano was also a frequent guest star on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', with a total of thirteen appearances.  In season 1 (1955\u201356) of \"Gunsmoke,\" he acted in the title role of \"Obie Tater\" (No. 5 in the series) about a group of outlaws who try to force Obie, an old prospector, to give up his gold.  (Newcomb, Horace (2010). \"Gunsmoke.\" The Museum of Broadcast Communications. Retrieved March 21, 2010.)    In 1962, he played Monty Fox, a prospector, in the episode \"Incident at Quivira\" on CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nDano was the voice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]]'' attraction, first presented at the [[1964 World's Fair]]. Disney personally selected Dano, because he felt the actor came closest to the historical descriptions of Lincoln's voice. ''Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln'' was moved to [[Disneyland]] in 1965, and Dano's vocals continued to be a part of the attraction until 2001. In 1971, his voice was also used for a revised Lincoln speech in the new \"Hall Of Presidents\" attraction at [[Magic Kingdom]] in Florida, which ran to 1993. In 2009, Dano's vocals were returned to ''Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln'' at Disneyland in an updated version of the show.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=Voice of Disneyland's Lincoln takes criticism|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/18/business/la-fi-ct-lincoln18-2009dec18|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 10, 2016|date=December 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDano was cast as the historical [[Henderson Luelling]] in the 1965 episode, \"The Traveling Trees,\" on the [[Television syndication|syndicated]]  [[anthology series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the story line, Luelling, against the advice of his wagon master, takes the [[Hastings Cutoff]] en route to [[Oregon]], where he intends to plant an [[apple]] orchard. [[Tim McIntire]] appeared as a young reformed outlaw, Ben Fraser, with Robert Yuro as Ben's older brother, Spencer Fraser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556914/|title=The Traveling Trees on ''Death Valley Days''|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> Dano also appeared in four other ''Death Valley Days'' episodes, including another 1965 segment, \"The Trouble with Taxes,\" in the role of Aaron Winters, founder of the Death Valley [[borax]] strike.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556888/|title=The Trouble with Taxes on '''Death Valley Days''|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDano played a coroner in ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973), who gets into a loud shouting match with [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]'s character. With no spoken dialogue (but singing the airman's version of the Navy Hymn), Dano was the saddened, unnamed preacher in ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''. Dano was the father of the Daltons in the 1979 TV movie ''[[The Last Ride of the Dalton Gang]]''. He is remembered for his comedic performance as the undead gold prospector, Gramps, in the horror/suspense/comedy/Aztec adventure ''[[House II: The Second Story]]'', and as Uncle Ned, a carnival attraction magician, in 1988's ''[[Ghoulies II]]''.

However, at the conclusion of the show Dano joined the rest of the cast, wearing a leprechaun costume.\n\nDano is remembered for his supporting roles in a number of 1950s [[western (genre)|western]] and mystery films. The chance for the breakout role of a lifetime escaped him in the theatrical release of ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (1951 film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]''. Dano, cast as The Tattered Man, delivered such a disturbing performance in his death scene, according to director [[John Huston]], that the initial test audience left the theater in droves, e.g., \"I've never seen so many people get up and leave the theater...they liked no part of it.\" The death scene was lent a human touch by Dano, and in 1951, war-weary Americans rejected it (Huston: \"...[the audience rejection] was a pretty sickening event.\"). ''Red Badge'' was immediately recut, and the death scene was removed. It is long believed, and as early as Huston commenting in an interview in 1972, the scene has been lost (\"I doubt very much, whether the scene still exists.\").<ref>''The Dick Cavett Show'' (2/21/72)</ref> Dano was also cast in [[Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln|\"Mr. Lincoln\"]], a five-part TV episode appearing in 1952\u201353 on ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]''; in keeping with a Civil War theme, Dano portrayed Lincoln himself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omnibus: James Agee's Mr Lincoln and the Civil War (DVD)|publisher=Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.com/Omnibus-James-Agees-Lincoln-Civil/dp/B0091C21XM|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe often worked with [[Anthony Mann]] and [[James Stewart]]. He played Elijah in [[John Huston]]'s film version of ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'', intoning to [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, \"At sea one day, you'll smell land where there'll be no land, and on that day, Ahab will go to his grave, but he'll rise again within the hour.

In the [[black comedy]] ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'', directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he had a small but pivotal role as the officious Deputy Sheriff. Over the years, Dano made many television appearances, often in bizarre, macabre roles such as [[Richard Boone]]'s ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' and the [[NBC]] [[legal drama]] ''[[Justice (1954 TV series)|Justice]]'' starring [[Dane Clark]] and [[Gary Merrill]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Justice|publisher=The Classic TV Archive|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Legal/Justice.htm|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn December 2, 1957, Dano appeared as Wilbur English, a fearful man who kills a fellow gang member to collect the reward in the episode \"Cheyenne Express\" of [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s [[NBC]] western series, ''[[The Restless Gun]].'' Ultimately, his cowardice causes Wilbur's own accidental death.<ref>\"Cheyenne\", ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', [[DVD]], Timeless Media Group.</ref> Earlier that year, he had played \"Sageman\", a wizened mystic, in the 1957 ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' episode \"Shoot for the Moon\".<ref>{{cite web|title=''Father Knows Best'' &ndash; Shoot for the Moon|work=[[TV Guide]]|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/father-knows-best/shoot-for-the-moon-19270/|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> In the MGM Technicolor widescreen religious epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', Dano in 1961 played the role of [[Simon Peter]].\n\nIn 1960, Dano guest starred on [[David McLean (actor)|David McLean]]'s NBC summer western series, ''[[Tate (TV series)|Tate]]''. That same year, he portrayed Lucas Frome in the episode \"Black Harvest\" on [[Don Durant]]'s [[CBS]] western, ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]''. In 1962, he guest starred on the CBS [[anthology series]], ''[[The Lloyd Bridges Show]]''.

Disney personally selected Dano, because he felt the actor came closest to the historical descriptions of Lincoln's voice. ''Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln'' was moved to [[Disneyland]] in 1965, and Dano's vocals continued to be a part of the attraction until 2001. In 1971, his voice was also used for a revised Lincoln speech in the new \"Hall Of Presidents\" attraction at [[Magic Kingdom]] in Florida, which ran to 1993.

Around this time, prostitution was reported to have taken place in brothels, such as the Paresis Hall in the [[Bowery]] district of New York and in some [[gay bathhouse]]s. Solicitation for sex, including paid sex, took place in certain bars between so-called \"fairies\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Heather Lee |last=Miller |title=Prostitution, Hustling, and Sex Work}}</ref>\n\nMale street prostitutes solicited clients in specific areas which became known for the trade. Well-known areas for street \"hustlers\" have included: parts of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd&nbsp;Street]] in New York City; [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in Los Angeles; Cypress Street in Atlanta; [[Piccadilly Circus]] in London; \"The Wall\" in Sydney's [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]; [[The Drug Store]] and [[Rue Sainte-Anne]] in [[Paris]]; [[Polk Street|Polk Street Gulch]] in San Francisco; and [[Taksim Square]] in Istanbul. Bars such as ''Cowboys and Cowgirls'' and ''Rounds'' in New York City, ''Numbers'' in Los Angeles, and certain go-go bars in [[Patpong, Thailand]] were popular venues where male prostitutes offered their services.\n\n===Examples===\nYoung male prostitutes in the [[Edo period]] of Japan were called [[kagema]]. Their clients were mainly adult men.\n\nIn southern areas of Central Asia and Afghanistan, adolescent males between twelve and sixteen years old perform erotic songs and suggestive dancing and are available as sex workers. Such boys are known as [[bacch\u00e1]].\n\nIn India, a [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is a physically male or [[intersex]] person who may sometimes enter into prostitution. Not all hijras are prostitutes, however, and many consider themselves to have a female identity in a male body and accept this as a sacred condition or gift. A common tradition in India is that Hijras dress as women and dance at weddings, child births, and other celebrations and demand a large amount of money from the owner.\n\nThe most famous male prostitute of the Victorian era was the Irish-born [[John Saul (prostitute)|John Saul]], who was involved in both the 1884 [[Dublin Castle]] scandal, and the [[Cleveland Street scandal|Cleveland Street Scandal]] of 1889.\n\n[[Cuba]]n male prostitutes are called [[Jineterismo|jinetero]] \u2013 literally \"horse jockey\"; female prostitutes are called [[jinetera]].\n\nA male sex worker in the [[Caribbean]] who solicits on the beaches and accepts clients of either sex is called a [[sanky-panky]].\n\n==Present-day male prostitution==\nThe following categorization of the male prostitute is not exhaustive:[[File:A popular \"Peep Show\" along St Catherine street in Montreal's Gay Village..jpg|thumb|A \"Peep Show\" along St Catherine street in Montreal's Gay Village.]]\n\n===Online===\nProfessional escorts (indoor sex workers) often advertise on male escorting websites, usually either independently or through an [[escort agency]].

Such an area may have a locally-known informal name. These areas tend to be risky for both the client and the prostitute, from a legal perspective when it is in a region where street prostitution or [[solicitation]] is prohibited by law, or also from a safety perspective. These areas may be targets for surveillance and arrests by law enforcement. Some male prostitutes solicit potential clients in other public spaces such as bus terminals, parks and rest stops.\n\n===Bathhouses and sex clubs===\nMale prostitutes may attempt to work in [[gay bathhouse]]s, [[sex shop|adult bookstores]] or [[sex club]]s, but prostitution is usually prohibited in such establishments, and known prostitutes are often banned by management.

Teenagers and runaways engaging in sex work have shown to be particularly at risk. In 2008, a scholarly paper reported that 300,000 male prostitutes were under the age of 16.<ref>https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2311&context=theses</ref>\n\nFor clients, risks may include: fear of social stigma and family or work problems if their activities with prostitutes do not remain secret; health-related risks; being robbed; or, very rarely, being blackmailed or injured.<ref name=Dynes/> German fashion designer [[Rudolph Moshammer]], for example, was killed by a man who said that Moshammer had reneged on a promise to pay him for sex.<ref>BBC News, 2005-01-16.

Men working on the street and younger men appear to be at greatest risk of being victimized by clients. Conversely, the risk of being robbed or blackmailed posed to clients of sex workers appears to be much lower than many imagine. This is especially true when clients hire sex workers through an established agency or when they hire men who have been consistently well reviewed by previous clients.\n\nThe [[pimp]] is relatively rare in male prostitution in the West, where most prostitutes generally work independently or, less frequently, through an agency.<ref name=Dynes/>\n\n====Stigma====\nFactors like the [[age disparity in sexual relationships|difference in age]], in [[social status]] and in economic status between the sex worker and his client have been cited as major sources of social criticism.<ref name=negatives>See, for example, [http://www.enmp.org/downloads/activity_report_compr.pdf European Network Male Prostitution Activity Report, November 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221184110/http://www.enmp.org/downloads/activity_report_compr.pdf |date=2007-02-21 }}, \"Practical experiences of Men in Prostitution\" (Sweden, Denmark, Stockholm), pp. 23\u201326: \"All [the] interviewed men [in Denmark] are aware of societies\u2019 negative perception of prostitution and do whatever possible to cover up. As a result they live double lives and create more and more distance from close relations and the wider society. Isolation and sufferance from not having anybody to share prostitution experiences with is profound. Some men describe[d] how the clients are their main or only social relation to society, and consider the relations as sexual friendships or the customers as father figures.\"</ref> Similar social stigma may also be attached to amorous relationships that do not involve direct payment for sexual services, and therefore do not fit the definition of prostitution, but which may be seen by some as a form of \"quasi\"-prostitution, (in that there is a power imbalance and a reward for companionship or sex). The older member in such relationships may be referred as a \"sugar daddy\" or \"sugar momma\"; the young lover may be called a \"kept boy\" or \"boy toy\".<ref>see Dynes, ''supra'', for a discussion of the fine line between \"kept boys\" and prostitution.</ref> Within the gay community, the members of this kind of couple are sometimes called \"dad\" (or \"daddy\") and \"son\" - without implying incest.

Offering support and health care to such stigmatized people can be difficult due to a reluctance to disclose information about their work to health care professionals, which can also make male prostitutes difficult to identify in order to reach out to.\n\nIn recent years, some organizations directed specifically at helping male sex workers have been founded and some studies have begun on this little-studied population. For example, [[Richard Holcomb]], a former sex worker, founded \"Project Weber\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Joe|title=Former Male Prostitute Helps Hustlers Leave R.I.

Holcomb cited the lack of data available on male commercial sex workers in the region as his reason for helping develop a 2010 survey to assess the needs of this population. Project Weber recruited and surveyed 50 male sex workers living on the streets of Providence. Holcomb cited the fact that he and members of his team are former sex workers themselves as one of the primary reasons why they were able to gain access to the men in order to conduct this survey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goslant|first=Justin|title=Male Prostitution in Providence|url=http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence|work=Article in The Anchor Newspaper.|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702224116/http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence/|archivedate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The project says they have gleaned valuable data on male sex workers who work and live on the streets of Providence. Holcomb has also created several documentaries meant to draw attention to the subjects of male street prostitution and drug use.\n\n==Feminist studies==\n\nThe topic of male prostitution has been examined by [[feminism|feminist theorists]]. Feminist theorists Justin Gaffney and Kate Beverley stated that the insights gained from research on male sex workers in central [[London]] allowed comparison between the experiences of the 'hidden' population of male prostitutes and the traditionally subordinate position of women in a patriarchal society. Gaffney and Beverley argue that male sex workers occupy a subordinate position in our society which, as with women, is ensured by hegemonic and patriarchal constructs.<ref>Justin Gaffney & Kate Beverley, \"Contextualizing the Construction and Social Organization of the Commercial Male Sex Industry in London at the Beginning of the Twenty-First Century,\" ''Feminist Review'', No. 67, Sex Work Reassessed (Spring, 2001), pp. 133\u2013141.</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{Main|Male prostitution in the arts}}\n\nThe male prostitute has been a common literary and cinematic [[stereotype]] in the West from the 1960s onwards. The male sex worker is often portrayed as a tragic figure; examples in film include Oscar-winning picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969) about a tragic would-be gigolo, ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991) about the friendship of two young hustlers, ''[[Mandragora (film)|Mandragora]]'' (1997) about young runaways who are manipulated into the dark underground world of prostitution, and ''[[Mysterious Skin]]'' (2004) in which a hustler has a history of molestation.\n\nThe male prostitute may be presented as an impossible object of love or an idealized rebel, such as in ''[[The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone]]'' (1961) about a middle-aged woman and a young gigolo in a tragic tryst. Though less frequent in cinema and in novels, the gigolo (a male prostitute with an exclusively female clientele) is generally depicted as less tragic than the gay hustler. The comedy-drama TV series ''[[Hung (TV series)|Hung]]'' (2009\u20132011) is about a high school basketball coach who turns to prostitution to deal with financial troubles.  Male prostitution is sometimes the subject of derisive humor, such as the slapstick farce ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'' (1999) and [[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo|its sequel]] (2005).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality|LGBT}}\n* [[Male prostitution in the arts]]\n* [[Gigolo]]\n* [[Age of consent]]\n* [[Female sex tourism]]\n* [[Male promiscuity]]\n* [[Prostitution]]\n* [[Sex tourism]]\n* [[Sacred prostitute]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=35em}}<!--Alphabetic-->\n* {{Cite book |author=Aggleton, Peter |title=Men Who Sell Sex: International Perspectives on Male Prostitution and AIDS |url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/aggle_reg_print.html |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-669-1|year=1999}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Elias |first=James |year=1998 |title=Prostitution : on whores, hustlers, and johns |publisher=Prometheus |isbn=978-1-57392-229-6 |oclc=39379620 }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Friedman |first=Mack |year=2003 |title=Strapped for cash : a history of American hustler culture |publisher=Alyson Books |isbn=978-1-55583-731-0 |oclc=51607360 }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Itiel |first=Joseph |year=1998 |title=A Consumer's Guide to Male Hustlers |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7890-0596-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0PA-4hrt_NoC}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Itiel |first=Joseph |year=2002 |title=Sex Workers As Virtual Boyfriends |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-56023-191-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ucUHlUEWb0C}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Koken |first1=Juline |last2=Bimbi |first2=David |last3=Parsons |first3=Jeffrey |chapter=Male and Female Escorts: A Comparative Analysis |year=2000 |title=Sex for Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-92295-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=LEhzBddEcjkC}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Aaron |year=2000 |title=The Male Escort's Handbook: Your Guide to Getting Rich the Hard Way |publisher=Late Night Press |isbn=978-0-9667691-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6XauPAAACAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Lumsden |first=Ian |year=1996 |title=Machos, maricones, and gays: Cuba and homosexuality |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-371-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mbH2pWBOZ1YC |page=7}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Padilla |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=Caribbean pleasure industry: tourism, sexuality, and AIDS in the Dominican Republic |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-64436-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HVS8GuF7QPUC}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Preston |first=John |year=1994 |title=Hustling: a gentleman's guide to the fine art of homosexual prostitution |publisher=Masquerade Books |isbn=978-1-56333-137-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AeK0AAAACAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Saunders |first=Dean |year=2008 |title=Nice Work If You Can Get It |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1-84454-509-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_t1XGgAACAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Steward |first=Samuel M. |year=1991 |title=Understanding the male hustler |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-56024-111-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=huJ6UwvZeL4C}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Sycamore |first=Matt Bernstein |year=2000 |title=Tricks and treats: sex workers write about their clients |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7890-0703-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BMrb5En0_S0C}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Jacqueline S\u00e1nchez |year=1997 |title=Marking the margins : research in the informal economy in Cuba and theDominican Republic |publisher=University of Leicester, Faculty of Social Sciences, Dept. of Sociology |series=Leicester University discussion papers in sociology, no S97/1 |oclc=37157551}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Jacqueline Sanchez |year=2001 |title=Dollars Are a Girl's Best Friend?

Well-known areas for street \"hustlers\" have included: parts of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd&nbsp;Street]] in New York City; [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in Los Angeles; Cypress Street in Atlanta; [[Piccadilly Circus]] in London; \"The Wall\" in Sydney's [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]; [[The Drug Store]] and [[Rue Sainte-Anne]] in [[Paris]]; [[Polk Street|Polk Street Gulch]] in San Francisco; and [[Taksim Square]] in Istanbul. Bars such as ''Cowboys and Cowgirls'' and ''Rounds'' in New York City, ''Numbers'' in Los Angeles, and certain go-go bars in [[Patpong, Thailand]] were popular venues where male prostitutes offered their services.\n\n===Examples===\nYoung male prostitutes in the [[Edo period]] of Japan were called [[kagema]]. Their clients were mainly adult men.\n\nIn southern areas of Central Asia and Afghanistan, adolescent males between twelve and sixteen years old perform erotic songs and suggestive dancing and are available as sex workers. Such boys are known as [[bacch\u00e1]].\n\nIn India, a [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is a physically male or [[intersex]] person who may sometimes enter into prostitution. Not all hijras are prostitutes, however, and many consider themselves to have a female identity in a male body and accept this as a sacred condition or gift. A common tradition in India is that Hijras dress as women and dance at weddings, child births, and other celebrations and demand a large amount of money from the owner.\n\nThe most famous male prostitute of the Victorian era was the Irish-born [[John Saul (prostitute)|John Saul]], who was involved in both the 1884 [[Dublin Castle]] scandal, and the [[Cleveland Street scandal|Cleveland Street Scandal]] of 1889.\n\n[[Cuba]]n male prostitutes are called [[Jineterismo|jinetero]] \u2013 literally \"horse jockey\"; female prostitutes are called [[jinetera]].\n\nA male sex worker in the [[Caribbean]] who solicits on the beaches and accepts clients of either sex is called a [[sanky-panky]].\n\n==Present-day male prostitution==\nIn 2008, a scholarly paper revealed that 300,000 male prostitutes were under the age of 16.<ref>https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2311&context=theses</ref>\n\nThe following categorization of the male prostitute is not exhaustive:\n[[File:A popular \"Peep Show\" along St Catherine street in Montreal's Gay Village..jpg|thumb|A \"Peep Show\" along St Catherine street in Montreal's Gay Village.]]\n\n===Online===\nProfessional escorts (indoor sex workers) often advertise on male escorting websites, usually either independently or through an [[escort agency]]. Such sites can face legal difficulties; in 2015, [[Rentboy.com]] \u2013 a well-known American site \u2013 was shut down by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and its operators charged with facilitating prostitution and other charges.<ref>{{cite news|title=Homeland Security's Peculiar Prosecution of Rentboy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/opinion/homeland-securitys-peculiar-prosecution-of-rentboy.html|accessdate=7 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2015}}</ref> Recent research suggests a substantial growth in numbers of online escorts worldwide, to the extent that the online market accounts for the vast majority of male sex workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.qut.edu.au/aboutmaleescorting/2017/11/01/number-of-online-male-escorts-by-nation-2/|title=Research shows distribution of online male escorts, by nation \u2013 Me, Us and Male Escorting|first=Suzanne|last=Dowey|website=Me, Us and Male Escorting}}</ref>\n\n===Streets, bars, and clubs===\nMajor cities in Europe and [[the Americas|the Eastern Hemisphere]] often have one or more areas where male street prostitutes regularly make themselves available to potential clients who drive by in cars. Such an area may have a locally-known informal name. These areas tend to be risky for both the client and the prostitute, from a legal perspective when it is in a region where street prostitution or [[solicitation]] is prohibited by law, or also from a safety perspective. These areas may be targets for surveillance and arrests by law enforcement. Some male prostitutes solicit potential clients in other public spaces such as bus terminals, parks and rest stops.\n\n===Bathhouses and sex clubs===\nMale prostitutes may attempt to work in [[gay bathhouse]]s, [[sex shop|adult bookstores]] or [[sex club]]s, but prostitution is usually prohibited in such establishments, and known prostitutes are often banned by management. However, in some places it is overlooked in order to keep the flow of business.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Male brothels===\n\nA male prostitute may work in a male [[brothel]], also known in some places as a \"stable\". {{citation needed span|text=This is common in South-East Asia and is also found in some towns and cities elsewhere.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe [[Cleveland Street scandal]] featured a [[London]] male brothel frequented by aristocrats, in 1889, when male homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom. In her biography ''The First Lady'', [[April Ashley]] quotes her ex-husband, the late [[Arthur Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan|Hon.

For prostitutes, the risks may include: social stigma; [[Homophobia|legal]]/criminal risks;<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/19317611.2011.537958|title = An Investigation of the Incidence of Client-Perpetrated Sexual Violence Against Male Sex Workers| journal=International Journal of Sexual Health| volume=23| pages=63\u201378|year = 2011|last1 = Jamel|first1 = Joanna}}</ref> physical abuse; health-related risks, such as the potential risk of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (especially high in case of [[anal sex]], less so in case of [[oral sex]]); rejection by family and friends; [[gay bashing]] (in the case of male-male prostitution); the financial risks that come with having an insecure income; and risks of the mental/emotional effects that come with all of those factors. Teenagers and runaways engaging in sex work have shown to be particularly at risk.\n\nFor clients, risks may include: fear of social stigma and family or work problems if their activities with prostitutes do not remain secret; health-related risks; being robbed; or, very rarely, being blackmailed or injured.<ref name=Dynes/> German fashion designer [[Rudolph Moshammer]], for example, was killed by a man who said that Moshammer had reneged on a promise to pay him for sex.<ref>BBC News, 2005-01-16. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4179807.stm Man 'confesses' to Munich murder].</ref> If a male prostitute steals from a male client or accepts money without then \"putting out\" the agreed-upon sexual services, it is sometimes referred to as \"rolling a john\".\n\nResearch suggests that the degree of violence against male prostitutes is somewhat lower than for female sex workers. Men working on the street and younger men appear to be at greatest risk of being victimized by clients. Conversely, the risk of being robbed or blackmailed posed to clients of sex workers appears to be much lower than many imagine. This is especially true when clients hire sex workers through an established agency or when they hire men who have been consistently well reviewed by previous clients.\n\nThe [[pimp]] is relatively rare in male prostitution in the West, where most prostitutes generally work independently or, less frequently, through an agency.<ref name=Dynes/>\n\n====Stigma====\nFactors like the [[age disparity in sexual relationships|difference in age]], in [[social status]] and in economic status between the sex worker and his client have been cited as major sources of social criticism.<ref name=negatives>See, for example, [http://www.enmp.org/downloads/activity_report_compr.pdf European Network Male Prostitution Activity Report, November 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221184110/http://www.enmp.org/downloads/activity_report_compr.pdf |date=2007-02-21 }}, \"Practical experiences of Men in Prostitution\" (Sweden, Denmark, Stockholm), pp. 23\u201326: \"All [the] interviewed men [in Denmark] are aware of societies\u2019 negative perception of prostitution and do whatever possible to cover up. As a result they live double lives and create more and more distance from close relations and the wider society. Isolation and sufferance from not having anybody to share prostitution experiences with is profound. Some men describe[d] how the clients are their main or only social relation to society, and consider the relations as sexual friendships or the customers as father figures.\"</ref> Similar social stigma may also be attached to amorous relationships that do not involve direct payment for sexual services, and therefore do not fit the definition of prostitution, but which may be seen by some as a form of \"quasi\"-prostitution, (in that there is a power imbalance and a reward for companionship or sex). The older member in such relationships may be referred as a \"sugar daddy\" or \"sugar momma\"; the young lover may be called a \"kept boy\" or \"boy toy\".<ref>see Dynes, ''supra'', for a discussion of the fine line between \"kept boys\" and prostitution.</ref> Within the gay community, the members of this kind of couple are sometimes called \"dad\" (or \"daddy\") and \"son\" - without implying incest. The social disdain for age/status disparity in relationships is and has been less pronounced in certain cultures at certain historical times.{{which|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Help and support for male sex workers==\n[[File:Rich Holcomb and James Waterman displaying the Project Weber poster at the 2010 HIV Prevention Summit in Washington DC..jpg|thumb|[[Richard Holcomb]] and James Waterman displaying the \"Project Weber\" poster at the 2010 HIV Prevention Summit in Washington, D.C.]]\nIn the United States and other places, there are few resources and little support readily available for male sex workers working and/or living on the streets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Joe|title=Do HIV/AIDS Service Organizations Effectively Reach Male Sex Workers?|url=http://www.edgenewengland.com/index.php?id=126242|work=Article in Edge New, Boston, Mass.|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> Men and boys in this situation may face many issues.

Offering support and health care to such stigmatized people can be difficult due to a reluctance to disclose information about their work to health care professionals, which can also make male prostitutes difficult to identify in order to reach out to.\n\nIn recent years, some organizations directed specifically at helping male sex workers have been founded and some studies have begun on this little-studied population. For example, [[Richard Holcomb]], a former sex worker, founded \"Project Weber\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Joe|title=Former Male Prostitute Helps Hustlers Leave R.I.

Holcomb cited the lack of data available on male commercial sex workers in the region as his reason for helping develop a 2010 survey to assess the needs of this population. Project Weber recruited and surveyed 50 male sex workers living on the streets of Providence. Holcomb cited the fact that he and members of his team are former sex workers themselves as one of the primary reasons why they were able to gain access to the men in order to conduct this survey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goslant|first=Justin|title=Male Prostitution in Providence|url=http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence|work=Article in The Anchor Newspaper.|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702224116/http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence/|archivedate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The project says they have gleaned valuable data on male sex workers who work and live on the streets of Providence. Holcomb has also created several documentaries meant to draw attention to the subjects of male street prostitution and drug use.\n\n==Feminist studies==\n\nThe topic of male prostitution has been examined by [[feminism|feminist theorists]]. Feminist theorists Justin Gaffney and Kate Beverley stated that the insights gained from research on male sex workers in central [[London]] allowed comparison between the experiences of the 'hidden' population of male prostitutes and the traditionally subordinate position of women in a patriarchal society. Gaffney and Beverley argue that male sex workers occupy a subordinate position in our society which, as with women, is ensured by hegemonic and patriarchal constructs.<ref>Justin Gaffney & Kate Beverley, \"Contextualizing the Construction and Social Organization of the Commercial Male Sex Industry in London at the Beginning of the Twenty-First Century,\" ''Feminist Review'', No. 67, Sex Work Reassessed (Spring, 2001), pp. 133\u2013141.</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{Main|Male prostitution in the arts}}\n\nThe male prostitute has been a common literary and cinematic [[stereotype]] in the West from the 1960s onwards. The male sex worker is often portrayed as a tragic figure; examples in film include Oscar-winning picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969) about a tragic would-be gigolo, ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991) about the friendship of two young hustlers, ''[[Mandragora (film)|Mandragora]]'' (1997) about young runaways who are manipulated into the dark underground world of prostitution, and ''[[Mysterious Skin]]'' (2004) in which a hustler has a history of molestation.\n\nThe male prostitute may be presented as an impossible object of love or an idealized rebel, such as in ''[[The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone]]'' (1961) about a middle-aged woman and a young gigolo in a tragic tryst. Though less frequent in cinema and in novels, the gigolo (a male prostitute with an exclusively female clientele) is generally depicted as less tragic than the gay hustler. The comedy-drama TV series ''[[Hung (TV series)|Hung]]'' (2009\u20132011) is about a high school basketball coach who turns to prostitution to deal with financial troubles.  Male prostitution is sometimes the subject of derisive humor, such as the slapstick farce ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'' (1999) and [[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo|its sequel]] (2005).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality|LGBT}}\n* [[Male prostitution in the arts]]\n* [[Gigolo]]\n* [[Age of consent]]\n* [[Female sex tourism]]\n* [[Male promiscuity]]\n* [[Prostitution]]\n* [[Sex tourism]]\n* [[Sacred prostitute]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=35em}}<!--Alphabetic-->\n* {{Cite book |author=Aggleton, Peter |title=Men Who Sell Sex: International Perspectives on Male Prostitution and AIDS |url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/aggle_reg_print.html |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-669-1|year=1999}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Elias |first=James |year=1998 |title=Prostitution : on whores, hustlers, and johns |publisher=Prometheus |isbn=978-1-57392-229-6 |oclc=39379620 }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Friedman |first=Mack |year=2003 |title=Strapped for cash : a history of American hustler culture |publisher=Alyson Books |isbn=978-1-55583-731-0 |oclc=51607360 }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Itiel |first=Joseph |year=1998 |title=A Consumer's Guide to Male Hustlers |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7890-0596-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0PA-4hrt_NoC}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Itiel |first=Joseph |year=2002 |title=Sex Workers As Virtual Boyfriends |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-56023-191-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ucUHlUEWb0C}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Koken |first1=Juline |last2=Bimbi |first2=David |last3=Parsons |first3=Jeffrey |chapter=Male and Female Escorts: A Comparative Analysis |year=2000 |title=Sex for Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-92295-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=LEhzBddEcjkC}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Aaron |year=2000 |title=The Male Escort's Handbook: Your Guide to Getting Rich the Hard Way |publisher=Late Night Press |isbn=978-0-9667691-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6XauPAAACAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Lumsden |first=Ian |year=1996 |title=Machos, maricones, and gays: Cuba and homosexuality |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-371-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mbH2pWBOZ1YC |page=7}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Padilla |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=Caribbean pleasure industry: tourism, sexuality, and AIDS in the Dominican Republic |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-64436-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HVS8GuF7QPUC}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Preston |first=John |year=1994 |title=Hustling: a gentleman's guide to the fine art of homosexual prostitution |publisher=Masquerade Books |isbn=978-1-56333-137-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AeK0AAAACAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Saunders |first=Dean |year=2008 |title=Nice Work If You Can Get It |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1-84454-509-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_t1XGgAACAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Steward |first=Samuel M. |year=1991 |title=Understanding the male hustler |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-56024-111-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=huJ6UwvZeL4C}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Sycamore |first=Matt Bernstein |year=2000 |title=Tricks and treats: sex workers write about their clients |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7890-0703-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BMrb5En0_S0C}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Jacqueline S\u00e1nchez |year=1997 |title=Marking the margins : research in the informal economy in Cuba and theDominican Republic |publisher=University of Leicester, Faculty of Social Sciences, Dept. of Sociology |series=Leicester University discussion papers in sociology, no S97/1 |oclc=37157551}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Jacqueline Sanchez |year=2001 |title=Dollars Are a Girl's Best Friend?

{"title_page": "Deformation theory", "text_new": "{{Short description|branch of mathematics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''deformation theory''' is the study of ''infinitesimal conditions'' associated with varying a solution ''P'' of a problem to slightly different solutions ''P''<sub>\u03b5</sub>, where \u03b5 is a small number, or vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon]),X)</math>\n\nwhere the source is the ring of [[Dual number|dual numbers]]. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThis implies that we can construct a [[formal scheme]] <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dual number]]\n*[[Exalcomm]]\n* [[Cotangent complex]]\n* [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]\n* [[Moduli of algebraic curves]]\n* [[Degeneration (algebraic geometry)]]\n\n==References==\n===Pedagogical===\n*Palamodov, V.

For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[x]),X)</math>\nSince we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nThis implies that we can construct a formal scheme <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dual number]]\n*[[Exalcomm]]\n* [[Cotangent complex]]\n* [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]\n* [[Moduli of algebraic curves]]\n* [[Degeneration (algebraic geometry)]]\n\n==References==\n===Pedagogical===\n*Palamodov, V.
