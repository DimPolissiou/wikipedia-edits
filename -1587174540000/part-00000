Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters and her pictures. On his doorstep, Hannah's friend [[Clay Jensen]] finds a box containing seven [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette tapes]], each containing a recording of Hannah narrating 13 reasons for her suicide.\n\nClay listens to the first tape, side A where Hannah talks about moving to town and becoming friends with her neighbor Kat, who is moving away before start of sophomore year. Kat throws a going-away party at Hannah\u2019s house so that Hannah can meet some new friends. Clay also attends the party, having been invited by Hannah at work. Clay recalls that [[Bryce Walker]] initially started to flirt with Hannah in which Hannah was receptive and flirted back until Kat realizing what is going on, breaks up the conversation by sending Bryce towards the beer. Both Kat and Clay warn her about Bryce. Kat then introduces her to [[Justin Foley (character)|Justin Foley]], Kat\u2019s boyfriend along with his friend [[Zach Dempsey]]. Kat  intends for Hannah to be interested in Zach, but Hannah instead finds herself smitten with Justin. Hannah later asks Kat for permission to pursue Justin, to which Kat consents. Hannah prints out Justin\u2019s class schedule to \u201cbump\u201d into him between classes and goes to his basketball game. Justin becomes interested and asks for her phone number. They begin a relationship, but it is ended by a bad first kiss between the two. Justin does nothing to stop the spread of a rumor about the encounter. Justin later shows Bryce a revealing photograph of Hannah, and Bryce circulates the photograph to everyone at school from Justin\u2019s phone, embarrassing Hannah. Clay recalls Hannah being hurt by his comment about the photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals Hannah\u2019s thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, the second set of tapes, held by a personal friend and classmate Tony, who is not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her. He finds listening to Hannah's story difficult, but his friend Tony finds him and reveals he plays a part in enforcing Hannah's will by making sure the tapes are heard; he knows Clay is mentioned on them. He warns Clay  things will go wrong if he does not obey the tapes.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite magazine|first=Shirlley|last=Li|title=Episode 1: \"Tape 1, Side A\"|url=https://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|access-date=April 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413074236/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|archive-date=April 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the B-side of the first tape, Hannah talks about her friendship with Jessica Davis and Alex Standall, who later start dating and stop hanging out with Hannah.

While secretly recording the conversation, Hannah does not explicitly tell him that she was raped but through questioning Hannah, Mr. Porter comes to understand that she was. Hannah refuses to disclose her rapist's identity if Mr. Porter cannot promise her that the rapist will go to jail. Mr. Porter could not promise her this but does vow to protect and support her through it. After failing to extract the boy's name and being told by Hannah that she does not want her parents or the police notified, Mr. Porter tells her that her the only other option would be to \"move on\". Hannah agrees and leaves his office, although he insists for her to stay. She leaves the office and briefly waits for Mr. Porter to chase after her but leaves once he does not do so. Hannah drops off her uniform on the counter at the Crestmont before delivering the tapes to Tony.

Although critics were split on several aspects of the show, in particular how it handled mental health and its depictions of rape and suicide, they highly praised Langford's performance. Langford later received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance.\n\n==Storyline (television series)==\nAt the beginning of the series, we learn that 17-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Baker has committed suicide by cutting her wrists. Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters and her pictures. On his doorstep, Hannah's friend [[Clay Jensen]] finds a box containing seven [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette tapes]], each containing a recording of Hannah narrating 13 reasons for her suicide.\n\nClay listens to the first tape, side A where Hannah talks about moving to town and becoming friends with her neighbor Kat, who is moving away before start of sophomore year. Kat throws a going-away party at Hannah\u2019s house so that Hannah can meet some new friends. Clay also attends the party, having been invited by Hannah at work. Clay recalls that [[Bryce Walker]] initially started to flirt with Hannah in which Hannah was receptive and flirted back until Kat realizing what is going on, breaks up the conversation by sending Bryce towards the beer. Both Kat and Clay warn her about Bryce. Kat then introduces her to [[Justin Foley (character)|Justin Foley]], Kat\u2019s boyfriend along with his friend [[Zach Dempsey]]. Kat  intends for Hannah to be interested in Zach, but Hannah instead finds herself smitten with Justin. Hannah later asks Kat for permission to pursue Justin, to which Kat consents. Hannah prints out Justin\u2019s class schedule to \u201cbump\u201d into him between classes and goes to his basketball game. Justin becomes interested and asks for her phone number. They begin a relationship, but it is ended by a bad first kiss between the two. Justin does nothing to stop the spread of a rumor about the encounter. Justin later shows Bryce a revealing photograph of Hannah, and Bryce circulates the photograph to everyone at school from Justin\u2019s phone, embarrassing Hannah. Clay recalls Hannah being hurt by his comment about the photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals Hannah\u2019s thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, the second set of tapes, held by a personal friend and classmate Tony, who is not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her.

The flag's design and symbolism are derived from several sources, but emerged during the [[Russian Revolution]]. The flag is also an international [[Communist symbolism|symbol]] of the [[communist movement]] as a whole. The nicknames for the flag were '''The Hammer and Sickle''' and '''The Red Banner'''.\n\nThe design is a solid field of [[Red (color)|red]] adorned with a unique [[Gold (color)|gold]] emblem in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|upper hoist quarter]]. The [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] was a traditional [[revolution]]ary symbol long before 1917, and its incorporation into the flag paid tribute to the international aspect of workers' revolution. The iconic [[hammer and sickle]] design was a modern industrial touch adopted from the Russian Revolution. The union of the hammer ([[workers]]) and the sickle ([[peasants]]) represents the victorious and enduring revolutionary alliance. The famous emblem is topped by a gold-bordered [[red star]] representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first flag was adopted in December 1922. In 1955, a statute on the flag was adopted which resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle. This was the final modification to the flag and it continued to be the official national flag until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=RCVH>{{cite web|url=http://www.vexillographia.ru/russia/ussr.htm|title=\u0424\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420|website=vexillographia.ru|author=Russian Centre of Vexillology and Heraldry|accessdate=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223059/http://www.vexillographia.ru/russia/ussr.htm|archive-date=21 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nIts imagery is now the basis for the flags of many communist parties: a yellow hammer and sickle on a red background.\n\n==Symbolism and design==\nThe flag of the Soviet Union consisted of a plain [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a gold [[hammer]] crossed with a gold [[sickle]] placed beneath a gold-bordered [[red star]]. This symbol is in the upper left [[Flag terminology|canton]] of the red flag.\n\nThe colour [[red]] honours the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and the [[red star]] and [[hammer and sickle]] are [[symbols of communism]] and [[socialism]].\n\nThe hammer symbolises urban [[Industry|industrial]] workers while the sickle symbolises [[agriculture|agricultural]] workers ([[peasant]]s)\u2014who together, as the [[Proletarian]] class, form the state.  The [[red star]] represents the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and its position over the hammer and sickle symbolises its leading role in [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist society]] to unify and enlighten the workers and peasants in the building of [[Communist society|communism]].\n[[File:Flag of the Soviet Union (vertical).svg|thumb|240x240px|A vertical display of the Soviet flag.]]\nThe flag's design was legislated in 1955, which gave a clear way to define and create the flag. This resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle.  The adopted statute stated that:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr6212.htm|script-title=ru:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420|author=USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium|language=Russian|date=19 August 1955|accessdate=2008-11-05|authorlink=Presidium of the Supreme Soviet}}</ref>\n#The ratio of width to length of the flag is 1:2.\n#The hammer and sickle are in a square with sides equal to {{frac|4}} of the flag's height.

In practice however, this was very commonly disregarded by flag makers as it was far easier and less costly to simply print the flag [[through and through]], with the obverse design mirrored on the reverse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/su'.html|title=Construction details of Soviet flags|website=flagspot.net|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> It was also common to see the reverse of the flag bear the hammer and sickle in the obverse formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/su.html#rev|title=Reverse of the flag - Soviet Union|website=flagspot.net|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> An example of the flag demonstrating its ''de jure'' status as being only one-sided is that of the Soviet flag atop the [[Moscow Kremlin]] which bore the single-side official design.\n\nFor vertical display, the flag was made with the distinct difference of having the hammer and sickle rotated 90 degrees in order to compensate for the change in dimensions. This was common in official practice, however the common flag owner would simply hang the standard design of the flag by the [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/su.html#ver|title=Vertical hoisting \u2013 Soviet Union|website=flagspot.net|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|the presidency of]] [[Vladimir Putin]], the Soviet flag is not only used for communism, but as a symbol for [[nostalgia for the Soviet Union|Soviet nostalgia]], which became a major global superpower that developed nuclear weapons and sent the first satellites, animals, and people into space.

The idea was dismissed as too visually aggressive.  Lenin apparently said \"A sword is not one of our symbols.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Flags of the states of the world|author=Konstantin AndreevichIvanov|language=Russian| location=Moscow|publisher=Izd-vo Transport|year=1971| page={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}|oclc=20146023}}</ref>\n\nThe first official flag was adopted in December 1922 at the First Congress of Soviets of the United States of Soviet Russia.  It was agreed that the red banner 'was transformed from the symbol of the Party to the symbol of a state, and around that flag gathered the peoples of the soviet republics to unite into one state&nbsp;\u2014 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'.  On 30 December 1922, the Congress adopted a Declaration and Agreement on the establishment of the USSR.  Article 22 of the Agreement states: 'the USSR has a flag, coat of arms and a state seal.'  The description of the first flag was given in the [[1924 Soviet Constitution]], accepted in the second session of the Executive Committee (CIK) of the USSR on 6 July 1923.  The text of article 71 states: 'The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a [[red]] or [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] field with states [[Coat of arms of the Soviet Union|coat of arms]]'. It was ordered with the unusual ratio of 4:1 in proportion and consisted of a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] with the state coat of arms in the center.  However, such a flag was never mass-produced.  This flag was the official flag for four months, and was replaced as the official flag by the more familiar [[hammer and sickle]] design during the third session of the CIK of the USSR on 12 November 1923.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|align=center|whitebg=y|height=100\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131923).svg|December 1922<br>\u2014<br>12 November 1923\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1924).svg|12 November 1923<br>\u2014<br>18 April 1924\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1924\u20131936).svg|18 April 1924<br>\u2014<br>5 December 1936\n}}\n\nIn the third session of the CIK of the USSR, the description of Soviet flag in the Constitution was changed, and article 71 was edited to be: 'The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a red or scarlet field, and in the canton a golden sickle and hammer, and a red five-pointed star bordered in gold above them.  The ratio of width to length is 1:2.'  On 19 August 1955 \"Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" was adopted by a decision of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].  This resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle. On August 15, 1980, a new edition of the \"Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" was adopted, which did not make any changes to the flag's description aside from removing the hammer and sickle on the reverse side of the flag.<ref name=RCVH></ref> From this point on, the flag stayed in use with this design until the disintegration of the USSR on 26 December 1991, at which time it ceased to be a national flag and replaced by national flags of the [[post-Soviet republics]].\n<center>\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|align=center|whitebg=y|height=100\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1936\u20131955).svg |5 December 1936<br>\u2014<br>19 August 1955\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg |19 August 1955<br>\u2014<br>26 December 1991\n}}\n</center>\nToday, the Soviet flag is used by the opposition, mainly left-wing rallies and demonstrations in the former Soviet space.

The flag's design and symbolism are derived from several sources, but emerged during the [[Russian Revolution]]. The flag is also an international [[Communist symbolism|symbol]] of the [[communist movement]] as a whole. The nicknames for the flag were '''The Hammer and Sickle''' and '''The Red Banner'''.\n\nThe design is a solid field of [[Red (color)|red]] adorned with a unique [[Gold (color)|gold]] emblem in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|upper hoist quarter]]. The [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] was a traditional [[revolution]]ary symbol long before 1917, and its incorporation into the flag paid tribute to the international aspect of workers' revolution. The iconic [[hammer and sickle]] design was a modern industrial touch adopted from the Russian Revolution. The union of the hammer ([[workers]]) and the sickle ([[peasants]]) represents the victorious and enduring revolutionary alliance. The famous emblem is topped by a gold-bordered [[red star]] representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first flag was adopted in December 1922. In 1955, a statute on the flag was adopted which resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle. This was the final modification to the flag and it continued to be the official national flag until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=RCVH>{{cite web|url=http://www.vexillographia.ru/russia/ussr.htm|title=\u0424\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420|website=vexillographia.ru|author=Russian Centre of Vexillology and Heraldry|accessdate=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223059/http://www.vexillographia.ru/russia/ussr.htm|archive-date=21 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nIts imagery is now the basis for the flags of many communist parties: a yellow hammer and sickle on a red background.\n\n==Symbolism and design==\nThe flag of the Soviet Union consisted of a plain [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a gold [[hammer]] crossed with a gold [[sickle]] placed beneath a gold-bordered [[red star]]. This symbol is in the upper left [[Flag terminology|canton]] of the red flag.\n\nThe colour [[red]] honours the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and the [[red star]] and [[hammer and sickle]] are [[symbols of communism]] and [[socialism]].\n\nThe hammer symbolises urban [[Industry|industrial]] workers while the sickle symbolises [[agriculture|agricultural]] workers ([[peasant]]s)\u2014who together, as the [[Proletarian]] class, form the state.  The [[red star]] represents the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and its position over the hammer and sickle symbolises its leading role in [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist society]] to unify and enlighten the workers and peasants in the building of [[Communist society|communism]].\n[[File:Flag of the Soviet Union (vertical).svg|thumb|240x240px|A vertical display of the Soviet flag.]]\nThe flag's design was legislated in 1955, which gave a clear way to define and create the flag. This resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle.  The adopted statute stated that:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr6212.htm|script-title=ru:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420|author=USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium|language=Russian|date=19 August 1955|accessdate=2008-11-05|authorlink=Presidium of the Supreme Soviet}}</ref>\n#The ratio of width to length of the flag is 1:2.\n#The hammer and sickle are in a square with sides equal to {{frac|4}} of the flag's height.

In practice however, this was very commonly disregarded by flag makers as it was far easier and less costly to simply print the flag [[through and through]], with the obverse design mirrored on the reverse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/su'.html|title=Construction details of Soviet flags|website=flagspot.net|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> It was also common to see the reverse of the flag bear the hammer and sickle in the obverse formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/su.html#rev|title=Reverse of the flag - Soviet Union|website=flagspot.net|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> An example of the flag demonstrating its ''de jure'' status as being only one-sided is that of the Soviet flag atop the [[Moscow Kremlin]] which bore the single-side official design.\n\nFor vertical display, the flag was made with the distinct difference of having the hammer and sickle rotated 90 degrees in order to compensate for the change in dimensions. This was common in official practice, however the common flag owner would simply hang the standard design of the flag by the [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/su.html#ver|title=Vertical hoisting \u2013 Soviet Union|website=flagspot.net|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|the presidency of]] [[Vladimir Putin]], the Soviet flag is not only used for communism, but as a symbol for [[nostalgia for the Soviet Union|Soviet nostalgia]], which became a major global superpower that developed nuclear weapons and sent the first satellites, animals, and people into space.

The idea was dismissed as too visually aggressive.  Lenin apparently said \"A sword is not one of our symbols.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Flags of the states of the world|author=Konstantin AndreevichIvanov|language=Russian| location=Moscow|publisher=Izd-vo Transport|year=1971| page={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}|oclc=20146023}}</ref>\n\nThe first official flag was adopted in December 1922 at the First Congress of Soviets of the USSR.  It was agreed that the red banner 'was transformed from the symbol of the Party to the symbol of a state, and around that flag gathered the peoples of the soviet republics to unite into one state&nbsp;\u2014 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'.  On 30 December 1922, the Congress adopted a Declaration and Agreement on the establishment of the USSR.  Article 22 of the Agreement states: 'the USSR has a flag, coat of arms and a state seal.'  The description of the first flag was given in the [[1924 Soviet Constitution]], accepted in the second session of the Executive Committee (CIK) of the USSR on 6 July 1923.  The text of article 71 states: 'The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a [[red]] or [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] field with states [[Coat of arms of the Soviet Union|coat of arms]]'. It was ordered with the unusual ratio of 4:1 in proportion and consisted of a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] with the state coat of arms in the center.  However, such a flag was never mass-produced.  This flag was the official flag for four months, and was replaced as the official flag by the more familiar [[hammer and sickle]] design during the third session of the CIK of the USSR on 12 November 1923.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|align=center|whitebg=y|height=100\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131923).svg|December 1922<br>\u2014<br>12 November 1923\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1924).svg|12 November 1923<br>\u2014<br>18 April 1924\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1924\u20131936).svg|18 April 1924<br>\u2014<br>5 December 1936\n}}\n\nIn the third session of the CIK of the USSR, the description of Soviet flag in the Constitution was changed, and article 71 was edited to be: 'The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a red or scarlet field, and in the canton a golden sickle and hammer, and a red five-pointed star bordered in gold above them.  The ratio of width to length is 1:2.'  On 19 August 1955 \"Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" was adopted by a decision of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].  This resulted in a change of the hammer's handle length and the shape of the sickle. On August 15, 1980, a new edition of the \"Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" was adopted, which did not make any changes to the flag's description aside from removing the hammer and sickle on the reverse side of the flag.<ref name=RCVH></ref> From this point on, the flag stayed in use with this design until the disintegration of the USSR on 26 December 1991, at which time it ceased to be a national flag and replaced by national flags of the [[post-Soviet republics]].\n<center>\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|align=center|whitebg=y|height=100\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1936\u20131955).svg |5 December 1936<br>\u2014<br>19 August 1955\n|File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg |19 August 1955<br>\u2014<br>26 December 1991\n}}\n</center>\nToday, the Soviet flag is used by the opposition, mainly left-wing rallies and demonstrations in the former Soviet space.
