It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

International]] cricket match between the [[England women's cricket team]] and the [[New Zealand women's national cricket team]], played on 22 March 2009 at the [[North Sydney Oval]] in Australia. It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

More than 30 attempts to kill an [[incumbent]] or former president, or a [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] have been made since the early 19th century. Four sitting presidents have been killed: [[Abraham Lincoln]] (1865), [[James A. Garfield]] (1881), [[William McKinley]] (1901), and [[John F. Kennedy]] (1963). Additionally, two presidents have been injured in attempted assassinations: [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1912; former president at the time) and [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981). In all of these cases, the attack weapon used was a firearm.\n\nAlthough historian James W.

His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.

After a highly publicized trial lasting from November 14, 1881 to January 25, 1882, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. A subsequent appeal was rejected, and he was executed by [[hanging]] on June 30, 1882 in the [[District of Columbia]], two days before the first anniversary of the shooting. Guiteau was assessed during his trial as mentally unbalanced and possibly suffered from some kind of [[bipolar disorder]] or from the effects of [[syphilis]] on the brain. He claimed to have shot Garfield out of disappointment for being passed over for appointment as [[United States Ambassador to France|Ambassador to France]].

McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[anarchist]], who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver that was concealed underneath a handkerchief. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach. Although McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, his condition rapidly declined due to [[gangrene]] setting in around his wounds and he died on September 14, 1901 at 2:15&nbsp;a.m.\n\nMembers of the crowd, started by [[James Benjamin Parker]], subdued and captured Czolgosz. Afterward, the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps, and police intervened, beating Czolgosz so severely it was initially thought he might not live to stand trial. On September 24, after a rushed, two-day trial in state court, in which the defendant refused to defend himself, Czolgosz was easily convicted and later sentenced to death. He was executed by the [[electric chair]] in [[Auburn Prison]] on October 29. Czolgosz's actions were politically motivated, although it remains unclear what outcome, if any, he believed the shooting would yield.\n\nFollowing President McKinley's assassination, [[United States Congress|Congress]] directed the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] to protect the president of the United States as part of its mandate.\n\n===John F.

On Sunday, November 24, 1963, while being transferred from the city jail to the county jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters by Dallas nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]]. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, even though it was later overturned on appeal. In 1967, Ruby died in prison while awaiting a new trial.\n\nIn September 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Kennedy and Tippit were both killed by Oswald, that Oswald had acted entirely alone in both murders, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald.

His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.

After a highly publicized trial lasting from November 14, 1881 to January 25, 1882, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. A subsequent appeal was rejected, and he was executed by [[hanging]] on June 30, 1882 in the [[District of Columbia]], two days before the first anniversary of the shooting. Guiteau was assessed during his trial as mentally unbalanced and possibly suffered from some kind of [[bipolar disorder]] or from the effects of [[syphilis]] on the brain. He claimed to have shot Garfield out of disappointment for being passed over for appointment as [[United States Ambassador to France|Ambassador to France]].

McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[anarchist]], who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver that was concealed underneath a handkerchief. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach. Although McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, his condition rapidly declined due to [[gangrene]] setting in around his wounds and he died on September 14, 1901 at 2:15&nbsp;a.m.\n\nMembers of the crowd, started by [[James Benjamin Parker]], subdued and captured Czolgosz. Afterward, the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps, and police intervened, beating Czolgosz so severely it was initially thought he might not live to stand trial. On September 24, after a rushed, two-day trial in state court, in which the defendant refused to defend himself, Czolgosz was easily convicted and later sentenced to death. He was executed by the [[electric chair]] in [[Auburn Prison]] on October 29. Czolgosz's actions were politically motivated, although it remains unclear what outcome, if any, he believed the shooting would yield.\n\nFollowing President McKinley's assassination, [[United States Congress|Congress]] directed the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] to protect the president of the United States as part of its mandate.\n\n===John F.

On Sunday, November 24, 1963, while being transferred from the city jail to the county jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters by Dallas nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]]. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, even though it was later overturned on appeal. In 1967, Ruby died in prison while awaiting a new trial.\n\nIn September 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Kennedy and Tippit were both killed by Oswald, that Oswald had acted entirely alone in both murders, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald.
