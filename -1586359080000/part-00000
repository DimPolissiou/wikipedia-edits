It stars Park and Wong as childhood friends Marcus and Sasha, who have not been in touch since a brief teenage fling ended badly. When Sasha returns to San Francisco to open a restaurant and romantic chemistry from their teenager years remains, Marcus's fears and Sasha's fame and demanding career challenge their potential new relationship.\n\nThe film was released in select theaters on May 29, 2019, and digitally on May 31, 2019, on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Keanu Reeves\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/keanu-reeves-always-be-my-maybe-ali-wong-randall-park-1203225809/ |title=How Keanu Reeves Ended Up in Ali Wong, Randall Park\u2019s Romantic Comedy 'Always Be My Maybe' |first=Angelique |last=Jackson |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 24, 2019 |accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nSasha Tran and Marcus Kim are childhood friends who grow up next door to each other in [[San Francisco]]. As Sasha's Vietnamese-immigrant/refugee parents regularly leave her home alone while they tend to their store, Marcus's parents often have her over for dinner, and Marcus's Korean American mother Judy teaches her to cook. Eventually Sasha and Marcus form a close friendship that carries on into their teenage years, but this is broken after his mother dies in an accident. Grieving, the two have sex but a wedge is driven between the two when they argue shortly afterwards and they fall out of touch.\n\nSixteen years later, Sasha is a celebrity chef and engaged to Brandon Choi, a successful restaurateur. Marcus is still in San Francisco living with his widowed father and performs in a talented but largely unsuccessful band that only plays in his neighborhood. He also has a girlfriend Jenny, an Asian American woman with dreadlocks. Sasha breaks up with Brandon after he delays their wedding yet again. Briefly moving back to the Bay Area to oversee the opening of a new restaurant, she has a chance encounter with Marcus when he and his father are hired to install air conditioning at her temporary home. \n\nAfter initial friction, they reconnect and become friends again, and Marcus admits to his father he still has feelings for Sasha. But before he can tell her, Sasha announces she has met someone new, and they wind up on a disastrous double date with Marcus' girlfriend and Sasha's new love interest: movie star [[Keanu Reeves]]. The long evening ultimately dissolves into chaos as Sasha confesses her longtime childhood crush on Marcus, a brawl breaks out between Marcus and Keanu, and Jenny ends up staying with Keanu for the night.\n\nSasha and Marcus then begin seeing each other, with Marcus reacquainting Sasha with the home and San Francisco Asian community she had distanced herself from, still harboring resentment of her absentee parents. He takes her to an old favorite [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] restaurant from their childhood, which Sasha remembers as terrible but discovers is delicious, marred only by her painful memories. As she reconnects to the city and the two fall in love, Marcus is taken aback to learn that, as planned, Sasha still intends to move on to [[New York]] for her next project, once the San Francisco restaurant has launched. When Sasha asks Marcus to join her, he refuses and she leaves San Francisco alone.\n\nTaken to task by both his father and his bandmates, Marcus realizes that his mother's death has made him scared to move on in life. He then moves out of his childhood home and takes steps to make his band more successful. He calls Sasha regularly with updates but, not receiving any reply, does not pursue her further until he discovers Sasha is secretly supporting his musical ambitions. This emboldens Marcus to surprise Sasha on the red carpet at an awards show in [[Manhattan]], asking for her to take him back and pledging to be wherever she is. She accepts. Reunited, Sasha takes Marcus to the New York restaurant she has been developing: it is named for and features Judy's recipes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Sasha Tran\n** [[Miya Cech]] as 12-year-old

It stars Park and Wong as childhood friends Marcus and Sasha, who have not been in touch since a brief teenage fling ended badly. When Sasha returns to San Francisco to open a restaurant and romantic chemistry from their teenager years remains, Marcus's fears and Sasha's fame and demanding career challenge their potential new relationship.\n\nThe film was released in select theaters on May 29, 2019, and digitally on May 31, 2019, on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Keanu Reeves\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/keanu-reeves-always-be-my-maybe-ali-wong-randall-park-1203225809/ |title=How Keanu Reeves Ended Up in Ali Wong, Randall Park\u2019s Romantic Comedy 'Always Be My Maybe' |first=Angelique |last=Jackson |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 24, 2019 |accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nSasha Tran and Marcus Kim are childhood friends who grow up next door to each other in San Francisco. As Sasha's Vietnamese-immigrant/refugee parents regularly leave her home alone while they tend to their store, Marcus's parents often have her over for dinner, and Marcus's Korean American mother Judy teaches her to cook. Eventually Sasha and Marcus form a close friendship that carries on into their teenage years, but this is broken after his mother dies in an accident. Grieving, the two have sex but a wedge is driven between the two when they argue shortly afterwards and they fall out of touch.\n\nSixteen years later, Sasha is a celebrity chef and engaged to Brandon Choi, a successful restaurateur. Marcus is still in San Francisco living with his widowed father and performs in a talented but largely unsuccessful band that only plays in his neighborhood. He also has a girlfriend Jenny, an Asian American woman with dreadlocks. Sasha breaks up with Brandon after he delays their wedding yet again. Briefly moving back to the Bay Area to oversee the opening of a new restaurant, she has a chance encounter with Marcus when he and his father are hired to install air conditioning at her temporary home. \n\nAfter initial friction, they reconnect and become friends again, and Marcus admits to his father he still has feelings for Sasha. But before he can tell her, Sasha announces she has met someone new, and they wind up on a disastrous double date with Marcus' girlfriend and Sasha's new love interest: movie star [[Keanu Reeves]]. The long evening ultimately dissolves into chaos as Sasha confesses her longtime childhood crush on Marcus, a brawl breaks out between Marcus and Keanu, and Jenny ends up staying with Keanu for the night.\n\nSasha and Marcus then begin seeing each other, with Marcus reacquainting Sasha with the home and San Francisco Asian community she had distanced herself from, still harboring resentment of her absentee parents. He takes her to an old favorite [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] restaurant from their childhood, which Sasha remembers as terrible but discovers is delicious, marred only by her painful memories. As she reconnects to the city and the two fall in love, Marcus is taken aback to learn that, as planned, Sasha still intends to move on to New York for her next project, once the San Francisco restaurant has launched. When Sasha asks Marcus to join her, he refuses and she leaves San Francisco alone.\n\nTaken to task by both his father and his bandmates, Marcus realizes that his mother's death has made him scared to move on in life. He then moves out of his childhood home and takes steps to make his band more successful. He calls Sasha regularly with updates but, not receiving any reply, does not pursue her further until he discovers Sasha is secretly supporting his musical ambitions. This emboldens Marcus to surprise Sasha on the red carpet at an awards show in Manhattan, asking for her to take him back and pledging to be wherever she is. She accepts. Reunited, Sasha takes Marcus to the New York restaurant she has been developing: it is named for and features Judy's recipes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Sasha Tran\n** [[Miya Cech]] as 12-year-old

[[Reggae en Espa\u00f1ol]] spread from the Spanish-speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American countries of [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] then to the rest of South America. [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of [[Bob Marley]] to Zimbabwe in 1980. In Jamaica, authentic reggae is one of the biggest sources of income.<ref>Bennetzen, J\u00f8rgen, and Kirsten Maegaard. \"Reggae\".

If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just something that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name.

Larry And Alvin's \"Nanny Goat\" and the Beltones\u2019 \"No More Heartaches\" were among the songs in the genre. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R&B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggae's great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry's \"People Funny Boy\", to the uptown sounds of Third World's \"Now That We\u2019ve Found Love\", it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae.<ref>\"Reggae.\" ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', 4th ed.

The DJ [[Don Letts]] would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as [[The Roxy (London)|The Roxy]]. Punk bands such as [[The Clash]], [[The Ruts]], [[The Members]] and [[The Slits]] played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England's inner cities and exemplified by groups like [[Steel Pulse]], [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] and [[UB40]], as well as artists such as [[Smiley Culture]] and [[Carroll Thompson]]. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK [[inner city]] themes, and Jamaican [[patois]] became intermingled with [[Cockney]] slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of [[Lovers Rock]], was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as [[Gregory Isaacs]], the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and [[Janet Kay]]. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include [[Third World (band)|Third World]], [[Black Uhuru]] and [[Sugar Minott]]. The Grammy Awards introduced the [[Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album]] category in 1985.\n[[File:Ruhr Reggae Summer M\u00fclheim 2014 Tanya Stephens 04.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Tanya Stephens]] in 2014 at a German Reggae festival]]\nWomen also play a role in the reggae music industry personnel such as Olivia Grange, president of Specs-Shang Musik; Trish Farrell, president of Island/Jamaica; Lisa Cortes, president of Loose Cannon; Jamaican-American Sharon Gordon, who has worked in the independent reggae music industry.<ref>Oumano, E.

''How to Play Rhythm Guitar'', p.72. {{ISBN|0-87930-811-7}}.</ref>{{audio|Reggae double riff on D and Em64 straight.mid|Play straight}} or {{audio|Reggae double riff on D and Em64 shuffle.mid|Play shuffle}}.]]\n\nStylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B), [[jazz]], [[mento]], [[calypso music|calypso]], African, and Latin American music, as well as other genres. Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead\u2014drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple vocalists.<ref>Lynn, V. M. (1973, Feb 18). Sound. ''Chicago Tribune (1963\u2013Current File)''</ref>\n\nReggae is played in [[time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time]] because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as {{music|time|3|4}}. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the [[Ska stroke|skank]].<ref>Hombach, Jean-Pierre (2010). ''Bob Marley the Father of Music'', p.14. {{ISBN|9781471620454}}. \"Reggae is most easily recognized by...the skank.\"</ref>\n\nThis rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each [[bar (music)|bar]] and combines with the drum's emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an \"and\" (example: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and, etc.) or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the \"downbeat\".<ref>Levitin, Daniel J. (2006). ''[[This Is Your Brain On Music]]'', pp. 113\u2013114 {{ISBN|978-0-452-28852-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe tempo of reggae is usually slower than both [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]].<ref name=\"All About Jazz\"/> It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of [[Syncopation|syncopated]], melodic bass lines that differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.\n\nHarmonically the music is essentially the same as any other modern popular genre with a tendency to make use of simple [[chord (music)|chord]] progressions. Reggae sometimes uses the dominant chord in its minor form therefore never allowing a perfect cadence to be sounded; this lack of resolution between the tonic and the dominant imparts a sense of movement \"without rest\" and harmonic ambiguity. Extended chords like the [[major seventh chord]] (\"[[Waiting in Vain]]\" by [[Bob Marley]]) and [[minor seventh chord]] are used though suspended chords or diminished chords are rare. Minor keys are commonly used especially with the minor chord forms of the subdominant and dominant chord (for example in the key of G minor the progression may be played Gm \u2013 Dm \u2013 Gm \u2013 Dm \u2013 Cm \u2013 Dm \u2013 Cm \u2013 Dm). A simple progression borrowed from [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music]] is the tonic chord followed by the minor supertonic chord with the two chords repeated continuously to form a complete verse (\"[[Just My Imagination]]\" by [[The Temptations]] C \u2013 Dm<sup>7</sup>).\n\nThe concept of \"call and response\" can be found throughout reggae music, in the vocals but also in the way parts are composed and arranged for each instrument. The emphasis on the \"third beat\" of the bar also results in a different sense of musical phrasing, with bass lines and melody lines often emphasizing what might be considered \"pick up notes\" in other genres.\n\n===Drums and other percussion===\nA standard drum kit is generally used in reggae, but the [[snare drum]] is often tuned very high to give it a [[timbales]]-type sound. Some reggae drummers use an additional timbale or high-tuned snare to get this sound.  Cross-stick technique on the snare drum is commonly used, and [[tom-tom drums]] are often incorporated into the drumbeat itself.\n[[File:One drop sixteenth-note pattern.png|thumb|right|230px|\"One drop\" sixteenth-note drum pattern]]\n\nReggae [[drumbeats]] fall into three main categories: ''[[One drop rhythm|One drop]]'', ''Rockers'', and ''Steppers''. With the ''One drop'', the emphasis is entirely on the backbeat (usually on the snare, or as a rim shot combined with bass drum). Beat one is empty except for a closed high hat commonly used, which is unusual in popular music. There is some controversy about whether reggae should be counted so that this beat falls on two and four, or whether it should be counted twice as fast, so it falls on three. An example played by Barrett can be heard in the [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] song \"One Drop\". Barrett often used an unusual [[irrational rhythm|triplet]] [[polyrhythm|cross-rhythm]] on the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]], which can be heard on many recordings by Bob Marley and the Wailers, such as \"Running Away\" on the ''[[Kaya (album)|Kaya]]'' album.\n\n[[File:SlyDunbar1979.png|thumb|left|Sly Dunbar]]\nAn emphasis on the backbeat is found in all reggae drumbeats, but with the ''Rockers'' beat, the emphasis is on all four beats of the bar (usually on bass drum). This beat was pioneered by [[Sly and Robbie]], who later helped create the \"Rub-a-Dub\" sound that greatly influenced dancehall. Sly has stated he was influenced to create this style by listening to American drummer Earl Young as well as other disco and R&B drummers in the early to mid-1970s, as stated in the book \"Wailing Blues\". The prototypical example of the style is found in [[Sly Dunbar]]'s drumming on \"Right Time\" by the Mighty Diamonds. The ''Rockers'' beat is not always straightforward, and various [[syncopation]]s are often included. An example of this is the [[Black Uhuru]] song \"Sponji Reggae\".\n\nIn ''Steppers'', the bass drum plays every quarter beat of the bar, giving the beat an insistent drive. An example is \"Exodus\" by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Another common name for the ''Steppers'' beat is the \"four on the floor\". [[Burning Spear]]'s 1975 song \"Red, Gold, and Green\" (with Leroy Wallace on drums) is one of the earliest examples. The ''Steppers'' beat was adopted (at a much higher tempo) by some [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] [[ska]] revival bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nAn unusual characteristic of reggae drumming is that the drum fills often do not end with a climactic cymbal. A wide range of other percussion instrumentation are used in reggae. [[Bongo drum|Bongos]] are often used to play free, improvised patterns, with heavy use of African-style [[cross-rhythm]]s. Cowbells, [[claves]] and shakers tend to have more defined roles and a set pattern.\n\nReggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.<ref>Dawson, M. (2012, 08). Jamaican drum sounds. ''Modern Drummer, 36'', 70.</ref>\n\n===Bass===\n[[File:RobbieShakespeare1978.png|thumb|upright|Robbie Shakespeare in 1978]]\nThe [[bass guitar]] often plays the dominant role in reggae, and the drum and bass is often the most important part of what is called, in Jamaican music, a ''[[riddim]]'' (rhythm), a (usually simple) piece of music that is used repeatedly by different artists to write and record songs with. Hundreds of reggae singers have released different songs recorded over the same rhythm. The central role of the bass can be particularly heard in [[dub music]] \u2013 which gives an even bigger role to the drum and [[bass line]], reducing the vocals and other instruments to peripheral roles.\n[[File:Reggae Bass Line.jpg|thumb|right|280px|In this typical reggae bass line, the roots of the chords are emphasized, with musical interest created by going from the root down to the fifth of the chord. A dotted quarter note and eighth note rhythm is used repeatedly.]]\nThe bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and [[equalization (audio)|equalized]] so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The bass line is often a repeated two or four bar [[riff]] when simple chord progressions are used. The simplest example of this might be Robbie Shakespeare's bass line for the Black Uhuru hit \"Shine Eye Gal\". In the case of more complex harmonic structures, such as [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]]'s version of \"Stranger in Love\", these simpler patterns are altered to follow the chord progression either by directly moving the pattern around or by changing some of the interior notes in the phrase to better support the chords.\n\n===Guitars===\n[[File:Al Anderson1978.png|thumb|upright|Al Anderson]]\nThe [[guitar]] in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in {{music|time|4|4}} time and counting \"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ...\", one would play a downstroke on the \"and\" part of the beat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reggaeguitarlessons.com/|title=Reggae Guitar Lessons|website=Reggaeguitarlessons.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531070416/http://www.reggaeguitarlessons.com/|archive-date=31 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A musical figure known as [[skank (guitar)|skank]] or the 'bang\" has a very dampened, short and scratchy [[chop chord|chop]] sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to \"[[Stir It Up]]\" by The Wailers. Artist and producer [[Derrick Harriott]] says, \"What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.\"<ref>Bradley, Lloyd. ''This Is Reggae Music:The Story Of Jamaica's Music.'' New York : Grove Press, 2001</ref>\n\n===Keyboards===\nFrom the earliest days of Ska recordings, a piano was used to double the rhythm guitar's skank, playing the [[chord (music)|chords]] in a ''[[staccato]]'' style to add body, and playing occasional extra beats, runs and riffs. The piano part was widely taken over by [[synthesizer]]s during the 1980s, although synthesizers have been used in a peripheral role since the 1970s to play incidental melodies and [[countermelodies]]. Larger bands may include either an additional keyboardist, to cover or replace [[brass instrument|horn]] and [[melody]] lines, or the main keyboardist filling these roles on two or more keyboards.\n\nThe reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument.<ref>Simon, A. (2006, Summer). Jazz piano stylings: A contemporary approach. ''Piano Today, 26'', 38.</ref> Typically, a [[Hammond organ]]-style sound is used to play chords with a choppy feel. This is known as the ''bubble''. This may be the most difficult reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not played\u2014that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second basic pattern, the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 (or beat 3 if counted at double time) or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.\n\n===Horns===\n[[Horn section]]s are frequently used in reggae, often playing introductions and countermelodies. Instruments included in a typical reggae horn section include saxophone, trumpet or trombone. In more recent times, real horns are sometimes replaced in reggae by [[synthesizer]]s or recorded samples. The horn section is often arranged around the first horn, playing a simple melody or counter melody. The first horn is usually accompanied by the second horn playing the same melodic phrase in unison, one octave higher. The third horn usually plays the melody an octave and a fifth higher than the first horn. The horns are generally played fairly softly, usually resulting in a soothing sound. However, sometimes punchier, louder phrases are played for a more up-tempo and aggressive sound.\n\n===Vocals===\n[[File:Ali Campbell at Raggamuffin 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[UB40]]'s former frontman [[Ali Campbell]] performing in 2009.]]\nThe vocals in reggae are less of a defining characteristic of the genre than the instrumentation and rhythm, as almost any song can be performed in a reggae style. However, it is very common for reggae to be sung in [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Jamaican English]], and [[Iyaric]] dialects. Vocal harmony parts are often used, either throughout the melody (as with vocal groups such as the [[Mighty Diamonds]]), or as a counterpoint to the main vocal line (as with the backing vocalists, the [[I-Threes]]). More complex vocal arrangements can be found in the works of groups like [[The Abyssinians]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] reggae band [[Steel Pulse]].\n\nAn unusual aspect of reggae singing is that many singers use ''[[tremolo]]'' (volume oscillation) rather than ''[[vibrato]]'' (pitch oscillation). Notable exponents of this technique include [[Horace Andy]] and vocal group [[Israel Vibration]]. The [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] vocal style is unique to reggae, originating when [[disc jockey|DJs]] improvised spoken introductions to songs (or \"toasts\") to the point where it became a distinct rhythmic vocal style, and is generally considered to be a precursor to [[hip hop music|rap]]. It differs from rap mainly in that it is generally melodic, while rap is generally more a spoken form without melodic content.\n\n====Lyrical themes====\nReggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered [[Motown]] or [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] soul and [[funk]] songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing [[Economic materialism|materialism]], or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]]. Many reggae songs promote the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also known as ''herb'', ''ganja'', or ''sinsemilla''), considered a sacrament in the [[Rastafari movement#Reggae|Rastafari movement]]. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music \u2013 whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God ([[Jah]]). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include [[black nationalism]], [[anti-racism]], anti-[[colonialism]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manioc.org/fichiers/HASH5cd4cf20c65d4a87ecfcf5 |title=The 1970's Reggae Revolution: resistance against Western Imperialism by Jeremie Kroubo-Dagnini |website=Manioc.org |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704024850/http://www.manioc.org/fichiers/HASH5cd4cf20c65d4a87ecfcf5 |archive-date=2013-07-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[anti-capitalism]] and criticism of political systems and [[Rastafarian vocabulary#Other words|\"Babylon\"]].\n\nIn recent years, Jamaican (and non-Jamaican) reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as \"Give a Little Love\", \"One Love\", or \"Three Little Birds\", all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics.<ref>Mills, Susan W. \"Reggae For Standards-Based Music Learning.\" ''General Music Today'' 17.1 (2003): 11\u201317. ''Music Index''.

This process has involved coerced or voluntary assimilation of more commercially compatible characteristics, appropriation by white mainstream artists, and an overall dispersal of ideological and musical meaning and creative value.The mainstream Euro-American audience has continually demonstrated a propensity for adopting reggae-oriented material on the basis of its aesthetically pleasing surface qualities rather than for explicitly political or deeper musical content, causing authenticity problems for reggae fans.<ref>Alleyne, M.

It does not have any specific characteristics other than being sung in Spanish, usually by artists of Latin American origin. [[Samba reggae]] originated in [[Brazil]] as a blend of [[samba]] with Jamaican reggae. Reggae also has a presence in [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. The most notable [[Jarocho]] reggae group being Los Aguas Aguas from [[Xalapa]]. Some of the most popular reggae groups across Latin America come from the Southern Cone, such as the Chilean band [[Gondwana (band)|Gondwana]], and the Argentinian band Los Cafres. The Puerto Rican band [[Cultura Prof\u00e9tica]] is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them.<ref>Davis, S. F. (2009). Reggae in cuba and the hispanic caribbean: Fluctuations and representations of identities. ''Black Music Research Journal, 29''(1), 25\u201349.</ref>\n\nBrazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafarianism. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations.<ref>B\u00e9hague, G.

''Latin American Music Review/Revista De M\u00fasica Latinoamericana, 27''(1), 79\u201390.</ref>\n\nMusically, it was the bloco afro [[Olodum]] and its lead percussionist, [[Neguinho do Samba]], that began to combine the basic samba beat of the blocos with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms and debuted their experimentations in the carnival of 1986. The new toques (drumming patterns) were labeled \"samba-reggae\" and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums (four of them at the minimum) divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.\n\nIn the state of [[Maranh\u00e3o]], in northeastern [[Brazil]], reggae is a very popular rhythm. [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Luis]], the state capital, is known as the Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 \"radiolas\", name given to sound teams formed by DJs and sound systems with dozens of powerful amplifiers boxes stacked. Reggae in Maranh\u00e3o has its own characteristics, such as melody and the way of dancing, as well as having its own radio and television programs. In 2018, the [[Reggae Maranh\u00e3o Museum|Reggae Museum of Maranh\u00e3o]] was inaugurated, the second reggae museum in the world (after [[Jamaica]]), with the objective of preserving the reggae culture history in the state.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://oimparcial.com.br/cultura/2018/01/museu-do-reggae-esta-aberto-ao-publico/|title=Museu do Reggae est\u00e1 aberto ao p\u00fablico {{!}} O Imparcial|date=2018-01-22|website=Oimparcial.com.br|access-date=2018-05-03|language=pt-BR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404073358/https://oimparcial.com.br/cultura/2018/01/museu-do-reggae-esta-aberto-ao-publico/|archive-date=2018-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, bands like [[Rebelution (band)|Rebelution]], [[Slightly Stoopid]], [[Stick Figure]], and [[SOJA]] are considered progressive reggae bands sometimes referred to as [[Cali Reggae]] or Pacific Dub.

Because of this, [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is [[lovers rock]], but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like [[drum and bass]] and [[dubstep]]. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world's most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist [[Maxi Priest]] began his career with seminal British sound system [[Saxon Studio International]].\n\nThree reggae-tinged singles from [[the Police]]'s 1978 debut album, ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'', laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the '70s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials' leader and keyboardist, [[Jerry Dammers]], founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness. The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae's godfathers, popular styles (including the genre's faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.<ref>Stemkovsky, I.

The achieved international success with hits such as \"[[Red Red Wine]]\", \"[[Kingston Town (song)|Kingston Town]]\" and \"[[Can't Help Falling in Love#UB40 version|(I can't Help) Falling in Love with You]].\"\n\nOther UK based artists that had international impact include [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]], [[Misty in Roots]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Janet Kay]], [[Tippa Irie]], [[Smiley Culture]] and more recently [[Bitty McLean]]. There have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be [[Alborosie]] (Italy) and [[Gentleman (musician)|Gentleman]] (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many [[riddim]]s. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley's famous [[Tuff Gong]] Studios. Since the early 1990s, several Italian reggae bands have emerged, including Africa Unite, [[Gaudi (musician)|Gaudi]], Reggae National Tickets, [[Sud Sound System]], [[Pitura Freska]] and [[B.R. Stylers]]. Another Italian famous reggae singer was [[Rino Gaetano]].\n\nReggae appeared on the [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav popular music scene]] in the late 1970s, through sporadic songs by popular [[rock music|rock]] acts.<ref name=\"trecisvijet\">{{cite web|url=https://trecisvijet.wordpress.com/2016/06/08/grad-zvani-vavilon-reggae-na-balkanu/|title=Grad zvani Vavilon \u2013 Reggae na Balkanu|date=8 June 2016|website=Trecisvijet.wordpress.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510120123/https://trecisvijet.wordpress.com/2016/06/08/grad-zvani-vavilon-reggae-na-balkanu/|archive-date=10 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Reggae saw an expansion with the emergence of [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav new wave scene]].<ref name=\"trecisvijet\"/> The bands like [[Haustor]], [[\u0160arlo Akrobata]], [[Aerodrom (band)|Aerodrom]], [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]], [[Du Du A]] and others recorded reggae and reggae-influence songs.<ref name=\"trecisvijet\"/> In the mid-1980s appeared [[Del Arno Band]], often considered the first real reggae band in Yugoslavia.

The result was that two open-air events look place on the same day.\n\nThe Reggae Sammer Jam '90 was staged as usual, but this year for only one day. The event took place at the Lorelei Rock amphitheater with artists like Mad Professor's Ariwa Posse with Macka B and Kofi, Mutabaruka, the Mighty Diamonds, the Twinkle Brothers, Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.\n\nThe other, ex-partner of the onceunited promoters succeeded in bringing the original Sunsplash package to Germany for the first time. Close to the Main River in the little village of Gemaunden deep down in rural south-central Germany, they staged a two-day festival that drew the bigger crowd. About 10,000 people came from all over the country as well as from neighboring states like trance and, for the first time, East Germany to see the lineup of top reggae artists.<ref>Habekost, C. \".

The [[guitar]] in reggae usually plays on the offbeat of the rhythm.  It is common for reggae to be sung in [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Jamaican English]], and [[Iyaric]] dialects.

[[Reggae en Espa\u00f1ol]] spread from the Spanish-speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American countries of [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] then to the rest of South America. [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of [[Bob Marley]] to Zimbabwe in 1980. In Jamaica, authentic reggae is one of the biggest sources of income.<ref>Bennetzen, J\u00f8rgen, and Kirsten Maegaard. \"Reggae\".

If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just something that came out of my mouth.

Larry And Alvin's \"Nanny Goat\" and the Beltones\u2019 \"No More Heartaches\" were among the songs in the genre. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R&B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggae's great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry's \"People Funny Boy\", to the uptown sounds of Third World's \"Now That We\u2019ve Found Love\", it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae.<ref>\"Reggae.\" ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', 4th ed.

The DJ [[Don Letts]] would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as [[The Roxy (London)|The Roxy]]. Punk bands such as [[The Clash]], [[The Ruts]], [[The Members]] and [[The Slits]] played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England's inner cities and exemplified by groups like [[Steel Pulse]], [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] and [[UB40]], as well as artists such as [[Smiley Culture]] and [[Carroll Thompson]]. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK [[inner city]] themes, and Jamaican [[patois]] became intermingled with [[Cockney]] slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of [[Lovers Rock]], was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as [[Gregory Isaacs]], the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and [[Janet Kay]]. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include [[Third World (band)|Third World]], [[Black Uhuru]] and [[Sugar Minott]].

Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead\u2014drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple vocalists.<ref>Lynn, V. M. (1973, Feb 18). Sound. ''Chicago Tribune (1963\u2013Current File)''</ref>\n\nReggae is played in [[time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time]] because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as {{music|time|3|4}}. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the [[Ska stroke|skank]].<ref>Hombach, Jean-Pierre (2010). ''Bob Marley the Father of Music'', p.14. {{ISBN|9781471620454}}. \"Reggae is most easily recognized by...the skank.\"</ref>\n\nThis rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each [[bar (music)|bar]] and combines with the drum's emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an \"and\" (example: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and, etc.) or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the \"downbeat\".<ref>Levitin, Daniel J. (2006). ''[[This Is Your Brain On Music]]'', pp. 113\u2013114 {{ISBN|978-0-452-28852-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe tempo of reggae is usually slower than both [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]].<ref name=\"All About Jazz\"/> It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of [[Syncopation|syncopated]], melodic bass lines that differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.\n\nHarmonically the music is essentially the same as any other modern popular genre with a tendency to make use of simple [[chord (music)|chord]] progressions. Reggae sometimes uses the dominant chord in its minor form therefore never allowing a perfect cadence to be sounded; this lack of resolution between the tonic and the dominant imparts a sense of movement \"without rest\" and harmonic ambiguity. Extended chords like the [[major seventh chord]] (\"[[Waiting in Vain]]\" by [[Bob Marley]]) and [[minor seventh chord]] are used though suspended chords or diminished chords are rare. Minor keys are commonly used especially with the minor chord forms of the subdominant and dominant chord (for example in the key of G minor the progression may be played Gm \u2013 Dm \u2013 Gm \u2013 Dm \u2013 Cm \u2013 Dm \u2013 Cm \u2013 Dm). A simple progression borrowed from [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music]] is the tonic chord followed by the minor supertonic chord with the two chords repeated continuously to form a complete verse (\"[[Just My Imagination]]\" by [[The Temptations]] C \u2013 Dm<sup>7</sup>).\n\nThe concept of \"call and response\" can be found throughout reggae music, in the vocals but also in the way parts are composed and arranged for each instrument. The emphasis on the \"third beat\" of the bar also results in a different sense of musical phrasing, with bass lines and melody lines often emphasizing what might be considered \"pick up notes\" in other genres.\n\n===Drums and other percussion===\nA standard drum kit is generally used in reggae, but the [[snare drum]] is often tuned very high to give it a [[timbales]]-type sound. Some reggae drummers use an additional timbale or high-tuned snare to get this sound.  Cross-stick technique on the snare drum is commonly used, and [[tom-tom drums]] are often incorporated into the drumbeat itself.\n[[File:One drop sixteenth-note pattern.png|thumb|right|230px|\"One drop\" sixteenth-note drum pattern]]\n\nReggae [[drumbeats]] fall into three main categories: ''[[One drop rhythm|One drop]]'', ''Rockers'', and ''Steppers''. With the ''One drop'', the emphasis is entirely on the backbeat (usually on the snare, or as a rim shot combined with bass drum). Beat one is empty except for a closed high hat commonly used, which is unusual in popular music. There is some controversy about whether reggae should be counted so that this beat falls on two and four, or whether it should be counted twice as fast, so it falls on three. An example played by Barrett can be heard in the [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] song \"One Drop\". Barrett often used an unusual [[irrational rhythm|triplet]] [[polyrhythm|cross-rhythm]] on the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]], which can be heard on many recordings by Bob Marley and the Wailers, such as \"Running Away\" on the ''[[Kaya (album)|Kaya]]'' album.\n\n[[File:SlyDunbar1979.png|thumb|left|Sly Dunbar]]\nAn emphasis on the backbeat is found in all reggae drumbeats, but with the ''Rockers'' beat, the emphasis is on all four beats of the bar (usually on bass drum). This beat was pioneered by [[Sly and Robbie]], who later helped create the \"Rub-a-Dub\" sound that greatly influenced dancehall. Sly has stated he was influenced to create this style by listening to American drummer Earl Young as well as other disco and R&B drummers in the early to mid-1970s, as stated in the book \"Wailing Blues\". The prototypical example of the style is found in [[Sly Dunbar]]'s drumming on \"Right Time\" by the Mighty Diamonds. The ''Rockers'' beat is not always straightforward, and various [[syncopation]]s are often included. An example of this is the [[Black Uhuru]] song \"Sponji Reggae\".\n\nIn ''Steppers'', the bass drum plays every quarter beat of the bar, giving the beat an insistent drive. An example is \"Exodus\" by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Another common name for the ''Steppers'' beat is the \"four on the floor\". [[Burning Spear]]'s 1975 song \"Red, Gold, and Green\" (with Leroy Wallace on drums) is one of the earliest examples. The ''Steppers'' beat was adopted (at a much higher tempo) by some [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] [[ska]] revival bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nAn unusual characteristic of reggae drumming is that the drum fills often do not end with a climactic cymbal. A wide range of other percussion instrumentation are used in reggae. [[Bongo drum|Bongos]] are often used to play free, improvised patterns, with heavy use of African-style [[cross-rhythm]]s. Cowbells, [[claves]] and shakers tend to have more defined roles and a set pattern.\n\nReggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.<ref>Dawson, M. (2012, 08). Jamaican drum sounds. ''Modern Drummer, 36'', 70.</ref>\n\n===Bass===\n[[File:RobbieShakespeare1978.png|thumb|upright|Robbie Shakespeare in 1978]]\nThe [[bass guitar]] often plays the dominant role in reggae, and the drum and bass is often the most important part of what is called, in Jamaican music, a ''[[riddim]]'' (rhythm), a (usually simple) piece of music that is used repeatedly by different artists to write and record songs with. Hundreds of reggae singers have released different songs recorded over the same rhythm. The central role of the bass can be particularly heard in [[dub music]] \u2013 which gives an even bigger role to the drum and [[bass line]], reducing the vocals and other instruments to peripheral roles.\n[[File:Reggae Bass Line.jpg|thumb|right|280px|In this typical reggae bass line, the roots of the chords are emphasized, with musical interest created by going from the root down to the fifth of the chord. A dotted quarter note and eighth note rhythm is used repeatedly.]]\nThe bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and [[equalization (audio)|equalized]] so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The bass line is often a repeated two or four bar [[riff]] when simple chord progressions are used. The simplest example of this might be Robbie Shakespeare's bass line for the Black Uhuru hit \"Shine Eye Gal\". In the case of more complex harmonic structures, such as [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]]'s version of \"Stranger in Love\", these simpler patterns are altered to follow the chord progression either by directly moving the pattern around or by changing some of the interior notes in the phrase to better support the chords.\n\n===Guitars===\n[[File:Al Anderson1978.png|thumb|upright|Al Anderson]]\nThe [[guitar]] in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in {{music|time|4|4}} time and counting \"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ...\", one would play a downstroke on the \"and\" part of the beat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reggaeguitarlessons.com/|title=Reggae Guitar Lessons|website=Reggaeguitarlessons.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531070416/http://www.reggaeguitarlessons.com/|archive-date=31 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A musical figure known as [[skank (guitar)|skank]] or the 'bang\" has a very dampened, short and scratchy [[chop chord|chop]] sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to \"[[Stir It Up]]\" by The Wailers. Artist and producer [[Derrick Harriott]] says, \"What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.\"<ref>Bradley, Lloyd. ''This Is Reggae Music:The Story Of Jamaica's Music.'' New York : Grove Press, 2001</ref>\n\n===Keyboards===\nFrom the earliest days of Ska recordings, a piano was used to double the rhythm guitar's skank, playing the [[chord (music)|chords]] in a ''[[staccato]]'' style to add body, and playing occasional extra beats, runs and riffs. The piano part was widely taken over by [[synthesizer]]s during the 1980s, although synthesizers have been used in a peripheral role since the 1970s to play incidental melodies and [[countermelodies]]. Larger bands may include either an additional keyboardist, to cover or replace [[brass instrument|horn]] and [[melody]] lines, or the main keyboardist filling these roles on two or more keyboards.\n\nThe reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument.<ref>Simon, A. (2006, Summer). Jazz piano stylings: A contemporary approach. ''Piano Today, 26'', 38.</ref> Typically, a [[Hammond organ]]-style sound is used to play chords with a choppy feel. This is known as the ''bubble''. This may be the most difficult reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not played\u2014that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second basic pattern, the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 (or beat 3 if counted at double time) or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.\n\n===Horns===\n[[Horn section]]s are frequently used in reggae, often playing introductions and countermelodies. Instruments included in a typical reggae horn section include saxophone, trumpet or trombone. In more recent times, real horns are sometimes replaced in reggae by [[synthesizer]]s or recorded samples. The horn section is often arranged around the first horn, playing a simple melody or counter melody. The first horn is usually accompanied by the second horn playing the same melodic phrase in unison, one octave higher. The third horn usually plays the melody an octave and a fifth higher than the first horn. The horns are generally played fairly softly, usually resulting in a soothing sound. However, sometimes punchier, louder phrases are played for a more up-tempo and aggressive sound.\n\n===Vocals===\n[[File:Ali Campbell at Raggamuffin 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[UB40]]'s former frontman [[Ali Campbell]] performing in 2009.]]\nThe vocals in reggae are less of a defining characteristic of the genre than the instrumentation and rhythm, as almost any song can be performed in a reggae style. However, it is very common for reggae to be sung in [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Jamaican English]], and [[Iyaric]] dialects. Vocal harmony parts are often used, either throughout the melody (as with vocal groups such as the [[Mighty Diamonds]]), or as a counterpoint to the main vocal line (as with the backing vocalists, the [[I-Threes]]). More complex vocal arrangements can be found in the works of groups like [[The Abyssinians]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] reggae band [[Steel Pulse]].\n\nAn unusual aspect of reggae singing is that many singers use ''[[tremolo]]'' (volume oscillation) rather than ''[[vibrato]]'' (pitch oscillation). Notable exponents of this technique include [[Horace Andy]] and vocal group [[Israel Vibration]]. The [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] vocal style is unique to reggae, originating when [[disc jockey|DJs]] improvised spoken introductions to songs (or \"toasts\") to the point where it became a distinct rhythmic vocal style, and is generally considered to be a precursor to [[hip hop music|rap]]. It differs from rap mainly in that it is generally melodic, while rap is generally more a spoken form without melodic content.\n\n====Lyrical themes====\nReggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered [[Motown]] or [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] soul and [[funk]] songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing [[Economic materialism|materialism]], or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]]. Many reggae songs promote the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also known as ''herb'', ''ganja'', or ''sinsemilla''), considered a sacrament in the [[Rastafari movement#Reggae|Rastafari movement]]. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music \u2013 whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God ([[Jah]]). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include [[black nationalism]], [[anti-racism]], anti-[[colonialism]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manioc.org/fichiers/HASH5cd4cf20c65d4a87ecfcf5 |title=The 1970's Reggae Revolution: resistance against Western Imperialism by Jeremie Kroubo-Dagnini |website=Manioc.org |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704024850/http://www.manioc.org/fichiers/HASH5cd4cf20c65d4a87ecfcf5 |archive-date=2013-07-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[anti-capitalism]] and criticism of political systems and [[Rastafarian vocabulary#Other words|\"Babylon\"]].\n\nIn recent years, Jamaican (and non-Jamaican) reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as \"Give a Little Love\", \"One Love\", or \"Three Little Birds\", all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics.<ref>Mills, Susan W. \"Reggae For Standards-Based Music Learning.\" ''General Music Today'' 17.1 (2003): 11\u201317.

This process has involved coerced or voluntary assimilation of more commercially compatible characteristics, appropriation by white mainstream artists, and an overall dispersal of ideological and musical meaning and creative value.The mainstream Euro-American audience has continually demonstrated a propensity for adopting reggae-oriented material on the basis of its aesthetically pleasing surface qualities rather than for explicitly political or deeper musical content, causing authenticity problems for reggae fans.<ref>Alleyne, M.

It does not have any specific characteristics other than being sung in Spanish, usually by artists of Latin American origin. [[Samba reggae]] originated in [[Brazil]] as a blend of [[samba]] with Jamaican reggae. Reggae also has a presence in [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. The most notable [[Jarocho]] reggae group being Los Aguas Aguas from [[Xalapa]]. Some of the most popular reggae groups across Latin America come from the Southern Cone, such as the Chilean band [[Gondwana (band)|Gondwana]], and the Argentinian band Los Cafres. The Puerto Rican band [[Cultura Prof\u00e9tica]] is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them.<ref>Davis, S. F. (2009). Reggae in cuba and the hispanic caribbean: Fluctuations and representations of identities. ''Black Music Research Journal, 29''(1), 25\u201349.</ref>\n\nBrazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafarianism. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations.<ref>B\u00e9hague, G.

The new toques (drumming patterns) were labeled \"samba-reggae\" and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums (four of them at the minimum) divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.\n\nIn the state of [[Maranh\u00e3o]], in northeastern [[Brazil]], reggae is a very popular rhythm. [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Luis]], the state capital, is known as the Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 \"radiolas\", name given to sound teams formed by DJs and sound systems with dozens of powerful amplifiers boxes stacked. Reggae in Maranh\u00e3o has its own characteristics, such as melody and the way of dancing, as well as having its own radio and television programs. In 2018, the [[Reggae Maranh\u00e3o Museum|Reggae Museum of Maranh\u00e3o]] was inaugurated, the second reggae museum in the world (after [[Jamaica]]), with the objective of preserving the reggae culture history in the state.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://oimparcial.com.br/cultura/2018/01/museu-do-reggae-esta-aberto-ao-publico/|title=Museu do Reggae est\u00e1 aberto ao p\u00fablico {{!}} O Imparcial|date=2018-01-22|website=Oimparcial.com.br|access-date=2018-05-03|language=pt-BR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404073358/https://oimparcial.com.br/cultura/2018/01/museu-do-reggae-esta-aberto-ao-publico/|archive-date=2018-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, bands like [[Rebelution (band)|Rebelution]], [[Slightly Stoopid]], [[Stick Figure]], and [[SOJA]] are considered progressive reggae bands sometimes referred to as [[Cali Reggae]] or Pacific Dub.

Because of this, [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is [[lovers rock]], but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like [[drum and bass]] and [[dubstep]]. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world's most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist [[Maxi Priest]] began his career with seminal British sound system [[Saxon Studio International]].\n\nThree reggae-tinged singles from [[the Police]]'s 1978 debut album, ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'', laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the '70s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials' leader and keyboardist, [[Jerry Dammers]], founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness. The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae's godfathers, popular styles (including the genre's faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.<ref>Stemkovsky, I.

There have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be [[Alborosie]] (Italy) and [[Gentleman (musician)|Gentleman]] (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many [[riddim]]s. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley's famous [[Tuff Gong]] Studios.
