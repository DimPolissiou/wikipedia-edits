Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which\u2014claimed Al-Biruni\u2014contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book|last= B\u012br\u016bn\u012b |first=Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad|date = 1910|title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030|chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them|volume = 1|page = 17|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner|place = London|url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/|accessdate = |postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar. His scholarship on the topic exhibited great determination and focus, not to mention the excellence in his approach of the in-depth research he performed. He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian. Biruni also employed astronomy in the determination of his theories, which were complex mathematical equations and scientific calculation that allows one to convert dates and years between the different calendars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy |last2=Engle |last3=Wamstad|first1=E.S. |first2=Susan |first3=Jeanne|title=The Hindu Calendar as Described in Al-Biruni's Masudic Canon|url=\n{{google books |plainurl=y |id=_OLYMgEACAAJ}}|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=1965|volume=24}}</ref>\n\nThe book does not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture to be more important. The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times. The lack of description of battle and politics makes those parts of the picture completely lost. However, Many have used Al-Biruni's work to check facts of history in other works that may have been ambiguous or had their validity questioned.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n== Works ==\n\nMost of the works of Al-Biruni are in [[Arabic]] although he wrote one of his masterpieces, the ''Kitab al-Tafhim'' apparently in both [[Persian language|Persian]] and Arabic, showing his mastery over both languages.<ref name=\"Nasr\">S.H.

Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which\u2014claimed Al-Biruni\u2014contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book|last= B\u012br\u016bn\u012b |first=Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad|date = 1910|title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030|chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them|volume = 1|page = 17|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner|place = London|url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/|accessdate = |postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar.

He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian.

The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times.
