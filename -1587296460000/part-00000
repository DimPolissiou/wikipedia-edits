The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nBecause Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam.  It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Long Island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe arrival of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting.  Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region.

The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nBecause Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam.  It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Long Island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe arrival of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting.  Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region.  Farms and resorts gave way to homes, and Huntington has transformed into a major [[bedroom community]] for nearby New York City.<ref name=HoH/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 3260\n|1800= 3894\n|1810= 4424\n|1820= 4935\n|1830= 5582\n|1840= 6562\n|1850= 7481\n|1860= 8924\n|1870= 10704\n|1880= 8098\n|1890= 8277\n|1900= 9483\n|1910= 12004\n|1920= 13893\n|1930= 25582\n|1940= 31768\n|1950= 47506\n|1960= 126221\n|1970= 200172\n|1980= 201512\n|1990= 191474\n|2000= 195289\n|2010= 203264\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=203236\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2016/cities/totals/sub-est2016_36.csv |title=Cities and Towns (Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions) Annual Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 9, 2018 |format=[[Comma-separated values|CSV]] }}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Huntington, NY\n|-\n!

The siege was part of a three-pronged attack on the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] [[Impi]]s of king [[Cetshwayo]] at [[Ulundi]]. After an incursion as far as [[Eshowe]] (then also known as '''Fort Ekowe''' or '''kwaMondi'''){{sfn|Laband|2009|pp=81, 366}} Colonel [[Charles Pearson (soldier)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged there for two months by the Zulus.\n\n==Prelude: Inyezane==\n\nNo.1 Column of the British invasion force, under Colonel Charles Pearson, had been ordered to establish an advanced base at Eshowe before continuing the advance upon [[Ulundi]]. The force crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] on 12 January 1879. The advance was unopposed until 22 January, when a Zulu force attempted to bar their way. The British were camped about {{cvt|4|mi\\km|abbr=on}} south of the [[Inyezane River]], which they had crossed the previous day, beneath a steep ridge with three spurs leading down towards the river and surrounded by scrub. A prominent knoll sat about halfway and there was a small [[kraal]] near the left of the crest.\n\nShortly after 08:00 a small number of Zulus appeared near the knoll on the ridge and a company of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), under Lieutenant Hart, were sent up the spur after them. While this company gave chase a mass of Zulus appeared over the crest of the ridge and began pouring downwards. These men were the left \"horn\" of a 6,000 strong force, dispatched at the same time as the army that engaged the British at Isandlwana, who were preparing just over the crest, to attack the British camp. This left horn had been prompted into a premature attack by the advance of Lieutenant Hart's company and in the face of this advance the NNC fled, leaving their European officers and NCOs to make a fruitless stand before being swept aside. As soon as Hart and his men began firing, the camp prepared for defence, forming a hasty firing line. A naval company and two companies of [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] with a [[Gatling gun]] and several [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounders]] moved up to the knoll, opening up across the advancing Zulu column. When the Zulus emerged from scrub and began their assault on the camp, they were subjected to massed fire from the flank and front; the Zulus wavered and then withdrew the way they had come.\n\nWhile the left horn was being repulsed, the rest of the Zulu [[impi]] appeared over the crest. The kraal was taken and switching their guns to focus on it, the British force that had attacked the flank of the left horn advanced up the slope and captured the kraal. This position allowed the British to move the Gatling gun onto the crest where its rapid fire soon drove the Zulus off the centre and left end of the ridge, as the British mounted troops came up the right-hand spur to complete the action. The counter-attack resulted in 10 British killed and 16 wounded. The Zulu impi withdrew with 350 killed.\n\n==Arrival at Eshowe==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Crossingtugela.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Troops crossing the Tugela River.]] -->\nPearson continued his march unhindered and the following day reached the mission fort near Eshowe at {{coord|28|54|28.7|S|31|27|41|E|type:landmark|name=Fort Nongqwayi}}, {{cvt|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. Eshowe consisted of a deserted church, school and the house of a [[Norway|Norwegian]] missionary. Low hills surrounded it about a quarter of a mile away to the north, east and west but to the south the Indian Ocean could be seen. Pearson sent a group of empty wagons with escorts to collect fresh supplies from the Lower Drift, while the rest of his force began to dig in. The next day, 24 January, bore a disturbing message for Pearson that Colonel [[Anthony Durnford]]'s No. 2 Column had been wiped out in the Middle Drift, leaving the Lower Drift behind Eshowe in grave danger. If the Zulus took the lower drift, Eshowe would be cut off and there would be nothing between the Zulu Army and Natal.\n\nTwo days later, [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] contacted Pearson. Without giving any details of the disaster at the  [[Battle of Isandlwana]] he informed him that all orders were cancelled and that he was to take such as action as he thought fit to preserve his column, including withdrawal from Eshowe if necessary. If he withdrew, he was to hold the bridgehead at the Lower Drift but he might be attacked by the whole Zulu Army. Pearson had no precise information on the whereabouts of the Zulu and although his defences around the mission would soon be complete, it was not an ideal position to defend. His force had plenty of ammunition but other supplies were insufficient and the consensus of his subordinates was to pull back to the Lower Drift. The decision to stay was settled on when news arrived of the return of the supply wagons, with five further companies as reinforcement from the Lower Drift.\n\n==Siege==\n\nThe fort enclosing the mission was roughly rectangular, {{cvt|200|\u00d7|50|yd|m|abbr=on}}, with loopholed walls {{cvt|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, and was surrounded by a broad ditch in which sharpened sticks were embedded. A second line of defence, should the outer rampart fall, was formed by [[laager]]ing the wagons inside the walls. A horse and cattle kraal was constructed, as was an [[abattis]]; a field of fire was cleared all round out to {{cvt|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The garrison numbered 1,300 soldiers and sailors, plus 400 wagoners.\n\nThe appearance of large bodies of Zulu on the surrounding hills on 2 February, although they retreated under shelling from the 7-pounders, compelled Pearson to request reinforcements. A week later, he learned for the first time the full extent of the centre column's defeat at Isandlwana and was told that there could be no reinforcement. Pearson considered withdrawing part of his garrison, if Chelmsford agreed but receiving no response and no further runners, it became clear that Eshowe had been cut off. The garrison would run out of provisions by the beginning of April.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=92}}\n\nFebruary passed with no Zulu attack, save for sniping attacks and skirmishes between patrols. The beginning of March led Pearson to attack a kraal 7 miles away, to keep the soldiers from idling. The next day a [[heliostat]] was spotted signalling from [[Fort Tenedos]] and a makeshift apparatus allowed Eshowe to reply. The garrison learnt that a relief force would depart the Lower Drift on 13 March and that they were to advance to the Inyezane to meet it. This was cheering news for the garrison, with rations running low and sickness having killed 20 men. A few days later another message advised a delay in the arrival of the relief column until 1 April.\n\n==The Relief Column==\n{{main|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n\n[[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] led this column, consisting of 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans to relieve the forces at [[Eshowe]]. The force had a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders, four 24-pounder rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s. The progress was slow, as in addition to taking a roundabout route to avoid ambush, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains. By the evening of 1 April, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane. The laager was sited on a 300-foot ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot [[Umisi Hill]]. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which itself encompassed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards in length. Here the relief column fought the [[Battle of Gingindlovu]], a British victory, before continuing on to Eshowe.\n\n==Eshowe relieved==\n\nOn 3 April, the relief column entered Eshowe, led by the pipers of the [[91st Highlanders]]. The two-month siege had been lifted. Chelmsford concluded that Eshowe did not need to be retained, and the laboriously constructed defences were demolished. Bivouacking on the first night after their departure from it on 6 April, Pearson's men could see that the Zulus had set Eshowe alight.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brookes|first1=Edgar H|authorlink=|last2=Webb |first2=Colin de B. |title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances E.|first2=Edward |last2=Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26\u201333|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

{"title_page": "George Gifford (Puritan)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n'''George Gifford''' (c.1548\u20131620) was a Puritan preacher at [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]], [[Essex]].\n\n==Life==\nGifford was born in [[Dry Drayton]], near [[Cambridge]] and attended [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1570 and MA in 1573.<ref>{{acad|id=GFRT569G|name=Giffard, George}}</ref> He afterwards lived at Maldon, but was discharged from the priesthood for refusing to subscribe to Archbishop Whitgift's articles of conformity. He was later reinstated as a lecturer at Maldon, serving there as a lecturer until his death in 1600.\n\nIt is possible that in 1586 he attended the deathbed of Sir Philip Sidney in the Low Countries, where Gifford was serving as chaplain to the Earl of Essex's troops. Gifford may well have penned ''The Manner of Sir Philip Sidney's Death''.\n\n==Works==\nGifford wrote some twenty-two published works. These include a translation of [[William Fulke]]'s ''Praelections vpon the sacred and holy Reuelation of S. Iohn'' (1573; STC:11443); ''A briefe discourse of certaine points of the religion which is among the common sort of Christians, which may bee termed the countrie diunitie'' (1581; STC:11845), which was his most popular work; ''A dialogue betweene a Papist and a Protestant'' (1582; STC:11849); and two works on witchcraft, ''A discourse of the subtill practises of deuilles by witches and sorcerers'' (1587; STC:11852) and ''A Dialogue Concerning Witches and Witchcrafts'' (1593; STC:11850).
