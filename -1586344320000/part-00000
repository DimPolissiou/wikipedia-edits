It opened in 1834 to transport goods between the market town of [[Wadebridge]], the limit of navigation on the [[River Camel]], and inland farming and mining areas. The railway was built to take stone from local quarries such as the [[De Lank Quarries]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] towards the coast, as well as sand dredged from the River Camel and landed at the quays in Wadebridge inland to be used to improve the heavy local soil. The station is situated just upstream of Wadebridge bridge and almost next to the tidal River Camel; a fact that prompted the former [[Poet Laureate]] [[John Betjeman]] to write in his autobiography \"''On Wadebridge station what a breath of sea scented the Camel Valley! Cornish air, soft Cornish rains, and silence after steam''\".<ref>{{cite book| last=Betjeman| first=John | authorlink=John Betjeman | title=[[Summoned by Bells]] | publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd| location=London | year=2007| pages=29 | isbn=978-0-7195-2220-8 }}</ref>\n\n==Original station==\nThe original station in Wadebridge was built on a triangle of land bounded by the River Camel, the Polmorla brook, and what is now The Platt. The single platform and engine shed were on the town side of the line, which continued across Molesworth Street to serve the quays immediately downstream of Wadebridge bridge. Towards Bodmin, the railway ran along the valley floor, leaving the town environs past Guineaport quay, and then hugging the south side of the Camel valley. This station remained in use until 3 September 1888 when the railway closed so that the track, still laid on the granite blocks used in its construction in 1834, could be relaid using the more usual transverse wooden sleepers.\n\n==Rebuilding and extension==\nOn 1 June 1895 the [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway|Bodmin and Wadebridge]] was linked to the [[London and South Western Railway]]'s [[North Cornwall Railway|North Cornwall Line]] which stretched away through the sparsely populated countryside of North Cornwall to [[Launceston railway station|Launceston]] and [[Okehampton railway station|Okehampton]], diverging from the Bodmin line at Wadebridge Junction at a point 48 [[chain (unit)|chains]] east of Wadebridge station near the confluence of the River Allen and River Camel. At this time a new station was built slightly nearer to Bodmin, separated from the central portion of Wadebridge town by the Polmorla brook. The single long platform contained the buildings that still exist: a one-storey station building incorporating a ticket office and waiting rooms, and a tall goods shed which was near enough to the rather squat station building to dominate it in height. In addition, a [[signal box]] was built immediately beyond the end of the platform.<ref name=\"pryer\">{{cite book | last = Pryer | first = G.A. | authorlink = |author2=Bowring, G.J.  | title = An Historical Survey of Selected Southern Stations: Volume One | publisher = Oxford Publishing Company | year = 1980 | location = Oxford | pages = 119 | isbn = 0-86093-016-5 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1899 construction works commenced on the westward extension of the North Cornwall Line towards [[Padstow railway station, Cornwall|Padstow]] via the [[salt marsh]] and the tidal Camel estuary to the port of [[Padstow]]. In order to accommodate the extra traffic anticipated, an [[island platform]] {{convert|105|yd|m}} in length was added between the existing platform and the engine shed, both sides of which were in use as platforms 2 and 3; the original platform being Platform 1. Access to this new island platform was gained by a wooden lattice [[footbridge#Railways|footbridge]] situated towards the Down (Padstow) end of the station. A waiting room and a generous canopy were also installed. The works also involved considerable re-arrangement of the track layout and signalling, with the original goods connection over Molesworth Street, using the existing [[level crossing]], to the quay being upgraded to a passenger line. The original signalbox was closed and replaced by two new signalboxes, \"Wadebridge East\" and \"Wadebridge West\". The first passenger train to use this stretch ran on 27 March 1899.\n\n==Later alterations==\n[[File:Wadebridge Railway Station 2.jpg|thumb|right|Restored platform canopy]]\nIn 1907 major alterations were made to Wadebridge station. The line towards Bodmin, up to this date single track, was doubled as far as the divergence of the [[North Cornwall Railway|North Cornwall Line]] from the Bodmin line, and soon after this the [[railroad switch|points]] at Wadebridge Junction were removed and the signalbox at that location closed. This meant that the two lines going in the Up direction from Wadebridge (towards Launceston and Bodmin respectively) were actually two parallel single-track lines once the points at Wadebridge East Signal Box had been passed. This was sited adjacent to the farm crossing that allowed access to Jubilee meadow, the field which separated the station from the river. At this time further lines were installed to the engine shed and the sand dock were also installed, the latter allowing access to the sand dock without having to use the lifting bridge which had been a hindrance as it was not strong enough to take the weight of a locomotive.\n\nFrom this date changes were few. The wooden LSWR pattern footbridge was replaced by a utilitarian pre-cast concrete model of [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] design during the 1920s and the signalling was replaced in late 1931. Platform 1 was extended by some yards in the direction of Bodmin, a noticeable feature as the extension was higher than the original platform and of brick construction rather than local stone. An annex to the goods shed was built in 1941 out of concrete blocks, taking most of the space between the original goods shed and the station building, although the end of the extension was latterly open after a shunting accident demolished a large portion of the end wall. The date of installation of the [[Turntable (railroad)|turntable]] is unclear, but by 1930 a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} turntable was in existence behind the engine shed; a larger turntable was never installed and engines such as the [[SR West Country and Battle of Britain Classes|West Country pacifics]] had to run down to Padstow where a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} turntable was provided.\n\n==Closure==\nThe North Cornwall line closed on 1 October 1966 and Wadebridge station, along with the line from Bodmin, closed to passengers on 30 January 1967. The line to Padstow remained for a quarter of a mile beyond the level crossing to allow access to the lines serving the quays on the river, but the remainder of the track to Padstow, and the whole of the line to Okehampton, were lifted. Even the quay lines did not last long, with the ancillary sidings being removed in November 1971 and the quay lines themselves in April 1973, the line then being terminated short of the [[level crossing]] at Molesworth Street. In keeping with its reduced status, the buildings on the island platform and the engine shed were demolished in the years after closure with the remains of the concrete footbridge being dumped unceremoniously in the turntable pit.\n\nWadebridge continued in use for freight until 1978, particularly sending out powdered slate from [[Delabole|Delabole quarry]] for which a vacuum system was installed to load Presflo wagons. The last loco-hauled passenger train, a 7-coach special from the midlands hauled by [[British Rail Class 25|Class 25]] number 25080, ran on 30 September 1978; a [[Diesel Multiple Unit|DMU]] shuttle from Bodmin, organised for charity, was the last passenger train of all on 17 December 1978.\n\nThe station featured in [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]]'s film of his verse autobiography ''[[Summoned by Bells (film)|Summoned by Bells]]''. He is seen standing on the derelict platform reciting his eponymous poem:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Betjeman |first1=Sir John |title=Summoned by bells (video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07nzwthQgxE |website=YouTube |accessdate=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic;\">On Wadebridge Platform what a breath of sea scented the [[River Camel|Camel valley]]!\nCornish air,\nSoft Cornish rain,\nAnd silence after steam...</poem>\n\n==The site today==\nThe main station building, granite with slate tiles, still stands as the Betjeman Centre. Similarly the original part of the goods shed is in use as a youth club. A road, Southern Way, runs along the old trackbed where the main platform was. The engine shed area is now a housing estate, and the sand dock is now a Co-op store although the road access still uses the railway bridge over the Polmorla Brook with the original railings still extant; Standing on this bridge looking towards the river Camel, the location of the railway siding giving access to the old sand dock can still be discerned although the bridge itself is long gone.\n\nOn the Padstow side of Wadebridge bridge a road occupies the space previously occupied by both the railway trackbed and an adjacent lane, but the lines which curved away from this towards the quays along the river cannot now be discerned. Once the limit of development on the riverside is reached the old trackbed, in the form of the [[Camel Trail]], becomes visible again.\n\n==Future plans==\nEfforts are being made to return trains to the Bodmin and Wadebridge railway line by extending the [[Bodmin and Wenford Railway]] from the current end of the running line at Boscarne Junction to a proposed new station at Wadebridge, situated just beyond Guineaport. This would mean diverting the Camel Trail in places to make way for the railway.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway Company|url=http://www.bodminandwadebridgerailway.co.uk/|publisher=Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway Company|accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Services==\n{{heritage rail start}}\n{{rail line |next=[[Grogley Halt railway station|Grogley]]|route=[[Bodmin and Wenford Railway]]<br><small>(Proposed RailTrail extension)</small> |col={{temporary rail colour|654321}} }}\n{{Disused Rail Insert}}\n{{Rail line|previous=[[St Kew Highway railway station|St Kew Highway]]|next=[[Padstow railway station, Cornwall|Padstow]]|route=[[Western Region of British Railways|British Rail Western Region]]<br><small>[[North Cornwall Railway|North Cornwall Line]]</small> |col={{BR(W) colour}} }}\n{{rail line |next=[[Grogley Halt railway station|Grogley]]|route=[[London and South Western Railway]]<br><small>[[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]]</small> |col={{LSWR colour}} }}\n{{rail end}}\n\n==References and sources==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book | last=Cooke | first =R.A. | title=Track Layout diagrams of the GWR. and BR (WR) Section 11 East Cornwall | year=1977}}\n* {{cite book | last=Fairclough | first=Anthony | title=The Story of Cornwall's Railways | year=1970| publisher=Tor Mark Press}}\n* {{cite book | last=Fairclough | first=Anthony |author2=Wills, Alan  | title=Bodmin and Wadebridge 1834 - 1978 | publisher=Bradford Barton | year=1979 | location=Truro | isbn = 0  85153 343 4 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Mitchell | first=David | title=British Railways Past and Present 17; Cornwall | publisher=Past and Present Publishing | year=1993 | isbn = 1-85895-060-0 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Mitchell | first=Vic |author2=Smith, Keith  | title=Branch line to Padstow | publisher=Middleton Press | year=1995 | isbn = 1-873793-54-5 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Stretton | first=John | title=The Bodmin and Wenford Railway | publisher=Past and Present Publishing | year=1999 | isbn = 1-85895-135-6 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.northcornwallrailway.co.uk/ North Cornwall Railway]\n\n[[Category:Disused railway stations in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Former London and South Western Railway stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1834]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1886]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1888]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1967]]\n[[Category:Beeching closures in England]]\n[[Category:Wadebridge]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox UK disused station\n | name = Wadebridge\n | coordinates = {{coord|50.5151|-4.8344|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline,title}}\n | image_name = Wadebridge railway station.jpg\n | caption =\n | manager = [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]] <br> [[London and South Western Railway]]\n | owner = [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] <br> [[Western Region of British Railways]]\n | locale = [[Wadebridge]]\n | borough = [[Cornwall]]\n | platforms = 3\n | years = 4 July 1834\n | events = Opened\n | years2 = 3 September 1888\n | events2 = Rebuilt\n | years3 = 30 January 1967\n | events3 = Closed to passengers\n | years4 = 2 September 1978\n | events4 = Closed to freight\n}}\n\n'''Wadebridge railway station''' was on the [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]], in Cornwall, England, UK.

In 2012, Scott signed his first [[Major record label|major-label]] deal with [[Epic Records]]. In November of the same year, Scott signed a deal with [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Music]], as part of its production wing [[Very GOOD Beats]]. In April 2013, Scott signed a [[record deal]] with [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle]] imprint.\n\nScott's first full-length project, the [[mixtape]] ''[[Owl Pharaoh]]'', was [[self-released]] in 2013. It was followed with a second mixtape, ''[[Days Before Rodeo]]'', in August 2014. His debut studio album, ''[[Rodeo (Travis Scott album)|Rodeo]]'' (2015), was led by the hit single \"[[Antidote (Travis Scott song)|Antidote]]\".

This mixed language has become the most apparent and common difference between Korean Hip hop and American hip hop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hare|first=Sarah|last2=Baker|first2=Andrea|date=April 2017|title=Keepin' It Real: Authenticity, Commercialization, and the Media in Korean Hip Hop|journal=SAGE Open|volume=7|issue=2|pages=215824401771029|doi=10.1177/2158244017710294|issn=2158-2440}}</ref><ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> As an instance, many of the Korean hip hop songs create rhymes by employing syllables with similar sounds from both languages.\n\nAs early stage Korean hip hop was heavily influenced by African American hip hop, Korean hip hop artists naturally started using [[African-American Vernacular English|AAVE]] in their lyrics.<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> The dominance of Korean American in the Korean hip-hop scene also contributed to the use of mixed language in Korean hip-hop. Korean American artists such as [[Drunken Tiger]], [[Jay Park]], and [[San E]] has included English lyrics in their raps and attracted the interests of the young generation.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were debates on the authenticity of lyrics written in English, and some artists deliberately refrained from using English in their lyrics.<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> For example, hip hop group [[Garion (band)|Garion]] was widely known for only using the Korean language in their lyrics. The word Garion, a Korean word meaning white horse with black mane, also reflects the group's identity. Today, such movement has weakened as Korean rap is now believed to have fully established in terms of linguistic and rhythmic making using the Korean language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Jonghyun|date=2016|title=Study on Korean Rap Artists and Their Linguistic Struggle and Practices in Rhyming|url=|journal=Linguistic Anthropology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Lyrical Contents<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> ===\nAlthough Korean hip hop adopted American hip hop music, the difference in culture naturally led to the difference in lyrical content. For example, in the early stages of Korean hip hop music, many Korean rappers referenced [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values and idioms. Vasco, a Korean rapper, explains, \u201cWhile American hip hop mainly dealt with themes of women, money, and drugs, there are no drugs in Korea. We need to tell stories that our friends can relate to and enjoy.\u201d In this sense, themes that are most often dealt in Korean hip hop music is everyday life or personal stories in the case of underground hip hop and is love in the case of mainstream hip hop.\n\n=== Musical Elements<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> ===\nWhile differences in sound were deemed small in distinguishing Korean hip hop music from American hip hop music, there has been consistent effort to incorporate Korean traditional sound into hip hop music. [[Seo Taiji and Boys]], first Korean musician to adopt hip hop elements in music, added a short solo playing of the traditional Korean conical oboe (t'aep'y\u00f4ngso) in their song 'Hay\u00f4ga' (1993). [[MC Sniper]], an underground rapper and the founder of the hip-hop crew Buddha Baby, is known for his early use of traditional musical and religious elements including the 12-stringed zither (kayag\u00fbm) and the transverse bamboo flute (taeg\u00fbm) and the Buddhist wooden percussion (mokt'ak) in his productions. OneSun, first-generation Korean hip hop musician, is known for his cross-over experiments between hip-hop and Korean traditional music. In April 2016, \u2018Ung Freestyle\u2019 produced by DPR crew which mainly used Korean instrument [[Gayageum|kayag\u00fbm]] attracted global popularity after being released on YouTube. [http://www.khiphopkvr.com/en/chapter-1-once-upon-a-time-on-the-korean-urban-scene/]\n\nThere has been criticism for such movement as well. Some musicians noted that Korean hip hop should not have a unique sound, but follow or use a recognizable global hip hop sound. For example, Code Kunst, a Korean hip hop producer, noted that \u201cI do not think Korea needs a unique sound of its own. People who are not Korean can sample \u2018Korean\u2019 sounds as well.\u201d\n\n=== Virtual and Local Scenes<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Um|first=Hae-Kyung|date=January 2013|title=The poetics of resistance and the politics of crossing borders: Korean hip-hop and 'cultural reterritorialisation'|journal=Popular Music|volume=32|issue=1|pages=51\u201364|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000542|issn=0261-1430}}</ref><ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> ===\nUnlike American hip hop, Korean hip hop started in the rooms and personal computer spaces of hip hop fans and then moved to the streets and performance spaces of Hongdae.\n\n==== Web-based communities ====\nEarly stage Korean hip hop was closely linked to the web-based communities created in web servers. Servers such as Ch\u00f4llian, HiTel, Daum, Nate, and Naver provided free web-based emails, messaging services and forums. PC communities created in these servers such as BLEX, Dope Soundz, and Show N Prove (SNP) worked as a place to share Korean translations of English lyrics, swap imported cassette tapes and CDs, and discuss the meaning of hip hop in their lives. First generation artists such as Verbal Jint, P-Type, Defconn (SNP), and Garion (BLEX) actively participated in these online communities. Web server-based communities diminished when people stopped using web servers in early 2000s, and the communities moved onto webzines and online sites. These webzines not only published articles but also facilitated communications in the hip hop scene. Some of online sites such as Hiphop Playa (since 2000), Rhythmer (since 2001) HiphopLE (since 2010) are still actively used as an online community for hip hop discussions as of 2019. Many of these online community users started holding monthly offline meeting called ''jeongmo'' to discuss hip hop music and perform their works, leading to the development of local scenes.\n\nIn early 2017, the very first Korean Hip Hop Awards was presented by two of the largest Korean Hip Hop webzines [[HiphopLE|HipHopLE]] and Hiphopplaya. Some of the awards included Rookie of the Year, Producer of the Year, Hip Hop Track of the Year, Hip Hop Album of the Year, and Artist of the Year. The winners being [[Justhis|JUSTHIS]], [[Groovy Room]], [[Bewhy|BeWhy]]\u2019s \u201cForever\u201d, [[Nucksal]]\u2019s \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d, and Jay Park respectively. In addition, the awards included a category showing which artists to look out for, such as Live and Mac Kidd.\n\n==== [[Hongdae, Seoul|Hongdae]] as local scene ====\nSince mid-1990s, Hongdae became the physical center of Korean hip hop scene. Hongdae, a northwestern part of Seoul, is named after a nearby Hongik University in the area. Widely known for its prestigious art/music college and liberal atmosphere, [[Hongik University]] contributed to the emergence of youth culture including hip hop music in the area. From the late 1990s, a number of clubs began to emerge in Hongdae where various types of music such as rock, techno, and hip hop were played. Master Plan (MP), originally an indie rock club located in greater Hongdae area, is often regarded as the birthplace for underground Korean hip hop. MP worked as a site for consuming, performing and sharing hip hop music. Street hip hop events such as Everyone's Mic hosted by Hiphopplaya also took place in Hongdae. Everyone's Mic is a weekly open rap competition for underground musicians where participants perform freestyle rap based on the beat played by the DJ. Hongdae not only functioned as a tangible place for production and consumption, but also became a symbolic place for underground hip hop music and imaginary ''gohyang'' (hometown) for musicians to build their identities.\n\n=== Media Relations ===\nMedia has played a huge role in forming the Korean hip hop scene. Especially the TV program [[Show Me the Money (South Korean TV series)|Show Me The Money]] (SMTM) gained massive popularity and enabled hip hop music to be the mainstream music in Korea. However, criticism against the authenticity of the TV show resulted in the emergence of independent YouTube channels operated by hip hop labels and musicians.\n\n==== Hip hop TV shows ====\nStarted in 2012, hip hop audition programs such as [[Show Me the Money (South Korean TV series)|Show Me the Money]], [[Unpretty Rapstar]], and [[High School Rapper (TV series)|High School Rapper]] became widely popular in Korea. SMTM is an audition program for amateur and professional rappers in which top 16 rappers divide into 4 teams and compete to be the final winner.[https://web.archive.org/web/20190620090141/http://onair.mnet.com/smtm777] Unpretty Rapstar is a female counterpart of SMTM and High school Rapper is a high school version of SMTM.[http://mnettv.interest.me/unprettyrapstar3/main][http://onair.mnet.com/schoolrapper3] As of June 2019, SMTM has had seven seasons and will be airing its eighth season on August 2019. Unpretty Rapstar has had 3 seasons from 2015 and High School Rapper has had 3 seasons from 2017. These reality competition shows are produced by Mnet, Korea's largest cable music channel operated under CJ Entertainment & Media ([[CJ E&M]]), an entertainment and media conglomerate.\n\nThese TV shows changed the notion of underground and overground hip hop music in Korea. Before the show, musicians who signed with major labels and frequently appeared on TV were considered overground rappers while ones who performed on small stages and worked independently were recognized as underground rappers. However, as hip hop TV shows made hip hop music a mainstream, even the underground rappers who were critical about overground rappers gained visibility through TV and started working with pop artists. Also, with the success of SMTM, underground rappers who negatively thought of signing with labels started considering the idea due to the promise of rising profits in the genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2015/03/the-rise-of-south-korean-hip-hop-keith-ape-interview|title= The Rise of South Korean Hip Hop|last=Maher|first=D.M.|date=2015-03-02|website=UK Complex|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-24}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901583758 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895221595 cite #44 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref> For example, Deepflow of VMC who criticized overground rappers for commercializing the hip hop scene, actively participated in several hip hop TV show as a producer from 2017.[http://hiphople.com/interview/4292672] Nafla and Loopy of Mkit Rain who criticized overground rappers for joining SMTM eventually joined SMTM season 7 as participants as well.[https://news.joins.com/article/23176608] Rather than being a stage for only the overground rappers, media and TV shows are now viewed as an opportunity for all types of new rappers to gain visibility and rise to the stardom. This transition has eventually blurred the distinction between underground and overground musicians.\n\n==== Social media and [[YouTube]] ====\nSocial Media such as YouTube and Sound Cloud has been one of the main channels Korean hip hop artists present their works and communicate with its fans. Mic Swagger, a YouTube-based freestyle rapping contents that invites different hip hop musicians as guests each episode, became a huge success throughout its four seasons since 2009 and contributed to the popularization of freestyle rap.[https://www.goodbgm.com/season-1] Also, in response to the criticism against the mainstream hip hop media like Mnet, hip hop artists started creating independent channels to express their thoughts and present their music to the public. Hip hop label H1gher Music partnered with Dingo, an online media contents creator, to promote new songs independent from the mainstream media.[https://www.mk.co.kr/news/entertain/view/2017/09/616935/] In 2018, rapper Mommy Son released a song named \u201cMommy Jump\u201d through his YouTube channel after being eliminated from SMTM season 7. The song which directly condemned Mnet and SMTM became a massive hit and was nominated the hip hop song of the year with 38 million YouTube view (as of June 2019).[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3ZFtSoWtRc]\n\nRappers and idols also use social media apps as a way of connecting to their fans, creating a sense of friendship with their fans.<ref>[https://adage.com/article/global-news/marketing-s-wave-korean-pop-star/235287]</ref> The use of music streaming apps such as Soundcloud, Youtube, and Spotify can help in exposure for Korean artists, as many of these apps, especially Soundcloud, are used by young kids around the world to discover these artists. <ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/ywkx4m/hip-hop-dont-stop-korean-style]</ref> Much of the music on these apps provide a similar sound to American rap music, which is popular not only for American teenagers but teenagers abroad as well. [https://medium.com/@juhapetteri.raatikainen/the-rise-of-korean-rap-culture-6df2afaf3b3a] There is also room for more experimentation on music platforms such as Souncloud because artists are able to upload their own work and express their creativity in a way they could not in the Korean idol system and form a deeper connection with their audiences with their work, as well as promote their solo work. [https://seoulbeats.com/2017/05/soundcloud-and-k-pop-where-artists-can-experiment/]\n\nThe emergence of bilingual Korean rappers also helps bridge the gap between Korean and American hip hop music along with social media. They can communicate with American fans in a way most non-English speaking Korean rappers cannot. Korean rapper DPR live explained his newfound presence in the US with his first-ever concert, by saying \u201cI always thought, you know, me being bilingual, just looking at the quality of both musics, it\u2019s both up to par. But Korean music has just as nice flavor, amazing qualities. [It's] just the world doesn\u2019t know yet. And obviously America is everywhere. Everyone knows.

Since the 1990s, American hip hop was brought into and spread through Korea in several channels: tangible forms of music like cassette tapes and CDs from America to Korea, individual bodies to/from America and within Korea, and virtual communities of hip hop listeners.<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> Korean Americans especially played a significant role in localizing American hip hop with their English-speaking ability and access to American culture. [[Tiger JK]] of [[Drunken Tiger]] and his wife [[Yoon Mi-rae]], then a member of a Korean-American hip-hop/R&B group called Uptown, formed the Movement Crew, the influential hip-hop community that gave rise to groups like Dynamic Duo, Leessang, and Epik High, who collectively planted the localized hip-hop firmly in the mainstream pop music in Korea.[https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/a-brief-history-of-korean-hip-hop.html] In Korea today, American hip hop and Korean hip hop exist as separate categories in almost every music charts and sales: ''oeguk hipap'' meaning foreign hip hop and ''gungnae hipap'' meaning domestic hip hop.\n\nThere are parallels between Korean hip hop and American hip hop, in that they follow a lot of trends from American hip hop while adding their own elements to them, creating their own personal sound from sounds widely popularised from American music. <ref>[https://eww.kr/blog/a-look-into-korean-hip-hop-culture/]</ref>  Korean hip hop was also founded in many ways to give voice to Koreans who felt a need to subvert from the norms of their country and found that way through Korean hip hop, in seeing the success of American rappers. <ref>[https://www.koreaexpose.com/removed-from-context-unbearable-lightness-korean-hip-hop/]</ref>\n\n=== Globalization - Spreading Korean Hip Hop ===\nSince 2010, Korean hip hop music started gaining international popularity. Epik High is credited as the first Korean hip hop musician to succeed in the international market. In 2014, with their album ''Shoebox'', Epik High reached the #1 spot on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] World Albums Chart. [[Epik High]] also held a North American tour and played in U.S. music and film festival [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2015 before becoming the first major Korean group to play in U.S. music festival [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7333010/epik-high-coachella-interview|title=Epik High on Being First Major South Korean Act to Play Coachella: 'It Feels Like a Miracle'|last=Herman|first=Tamar|date=2016-04-12|website=Billboard|access-date=2016-05-02}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901583758 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895221595 cite #39 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

If we listen to it alongside what is topping the iTunes hip hop chart, does it fit there? If I look at other Korean rappers\u2019 music, it does not fit at all.

This mixed language has become the most apparent and common difference between Korean Hip hop and American hip hop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hare|first=Sarah|last2=Baker|first2=Andrea|date=April 2017|title=Keepin' It Real: Authenticity, Commercialization, and the Media in Korean Hip Hop|journal=SAGE Open|volume=7|issue=2|pages=215824401771029|doi=10.1177/2158244017710294|issn=2158-2440}}</ref><ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> As an instance, many of the Korean hip hop songs create rhymes by employing syllables with similar sounds from both languages.\n\nAs early stage Korean hip hop was heavily influenced by African American hip hop, Korean hip hop artists naturally started using [[African-American Vernacular English|AAVE]] in their lyrics.<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> The dominance of Korean American in the Korean hip-hop scene also contributed to the use of mixed language in Korean hip-hop. Korean American artists such as [[Drunken Tiger]], [[Jay Park]], and [[San E]] has included English lyrics in their raps and attracted the interests of the young generation.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were debates on the authenticity of lyrics written in English, and some artists deliberately refrained from using English in their lyrics.<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> For example, hip hop group [[Garion (band)|Garion]] was widely known for only using the Korean language in their lyrics. The word Garion, a Korean word meaning white horse with black mane, also reflects the group's identity. Today, such movement has weakened as Korean rap is now believed to have fully established in terms of linguistic and rhythmic making using the Korean language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Jonghyun|date=2016|title=Study on Korean Rap Artists and Their Linguistic Struggle and Practices in Rhyming|url=|journal=Linguistic Anthropology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Lyrical Contents<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> ===\nAlthough Korean hip hop adopted American hip hop music, the difference in culture naturally led to the difference in lyrical content. For example, in the early stages of Korean hip hop music, many Korean rappers referenced [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values and idioms. Vasco, a Korean rapper, explains, \u201cWhile American hip hop mainly dealt with themes of women, money, and drugs, there are no drugs in Korea. We need to tell stories that our friends can relate to and enjoy.\u201d In this sense, themes that are most often dealt in Korean hip hop music is everyday life or personal stories in the case of underground hip hop and is love in the case of mainstream hip hop.\n\n=== Musical Elements<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> ===\nWhile differences in sound were deemed small in distinguishing Korean hip hop music from American hip hop music, there has been consistent effort to incorporate Korean traditional sound into hip hop music. [[Seo Taiji and Boys]], first Korean musician to adopt hip hop elements in music, added a short solo playing of the traditional Korean conical oboe (t'aep'y\u00f4ngso) in their song 'Hay\u00f4ga' (1993). [[MC Sniper]], an underground rapper and the founder of the hip-hop crew Buddha Baby, is known for his early use of traditional musical and religious elements including the 12-stringed zither (kayag\u00fbm) and the transverse bamboo flute (taeg\u00fbm) and the Buddhist wooden percussion (mokt'ak) in his productions. OneSun, first-generation Korean hip hop musician, is known for his cross-over experiments between hip-hop and Korean traditional music. In April 2016, \u2018Ung Freestyle\u2019 produced by DPR crew which mainly used Korean instrument [[Gayageum|kayag\u00fbm]] attracted global popularity after being released on YouTube. [http://www.khiphopkvr.com/en/chapter-1-once-upon-a-time-on-the-korean-urban-scene/]\n\nThere has been criticism for such movement as well. Some musicians noted that Korean hip hop should not have a unique sound, but follow or use a recognizable global hip hop sound. For example, Code Kunst, a Korean hip hop producer, noted that \u201cI do not think Korea needs a unique sound of its own. People who are not Korean can sample \u2018Korean\u2019 sounds as well.\u201d\n\n=== Virtual and Local Scenes<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Um|first=Hae-Kyung|date=January 2013|title=The poetics of resistance and the politics of crossing borders: Korean hip-hop and 'cultural reterritorialisation'|journal=Popular Music|volume=32|issue=1|pages=51\u201364|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000542|issn=0261-1430}}</ref><ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> ===\nUnlike American hip hop, Korean hip hop started in the rooms and personal computer spaces of hip hop fans and then moved to the streets and performance spaces of Hongdae.\n\n==== Web-based communities ====\nEarly stage Korean hip hop was closely linked to the web-based communities created in web servers. Servers such as Ch\u00f4llian, HiTel, Daum, Nate, and Naver provided free web-based emails, messaging services and forums. PC communities created in these servers such as BLEX, Dope Soundz, and Show N Prove (SNP) worked as a place to share Korean translations of English lyrics, swap imported cassette tapes and CDs, and discuss the meaning of hip hop in their lives. First generation artists such as Verbal Jint, P-Type, Defconn (SNP), and Garion (BLEX) actively participated in these online communities. Web server-based communities diminished when people stopped using web servers in early 2000s, and the communities moved onto webzines and online sites. These webzines not only published articles but also facilitated communications in the hip hop scene. Some of online sites such as Hiphop Playa (since 2000), Rhythmer (since 2001) HiphopLE (since 2010) are still actively used as an online community for hip hop discussions as of 2019. Many of these online community users started holding monthly offline meeting called ''jeongmo'' to discuss hip hop music and perform their works, leading to the development of local scenes.\n\nIn early 2017, the very first Korean Hip Hop Awards was presented by two of the largest Korean Hip Hop webzines [[HiphopLE|HipHopLE]] and Hiphopplaya. Some of the awards included Rookie of the Year, Producer of the Year, Hip Hop Track of the Year, Hip Hop Album of the Year, and Artist of the Year. The winners being [[Justhis|JUSTHIS]], [[Groovy Room]], [[Bewhy|BeWhy]]\u2019s \u201cForever\u201d, [[Nucksal]]\u2019s \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d, and Jay Park respectively. In addition, the awards included a category showing which artists to look out for, such as Live and Mac Kidd.\n\n==== [[Hongdae, Seoul|Hongdae]] as local scene ====\nSince mid-1990s, Hongdae became the physical center of Korean hip hop scene. Hongdae, a northwestern part of Seoul, is named after a nearby Hongik University in the area. Widely known for its prestigious art/music college and liberal atmosphere, [[Hongik University]] contributed to the emergence of youth culture including hip hop music in the area. From the late 1990s, a number of clubs began to emerge in Hongdae where various types of music such as rock, techno, and hip hop were played. Master Plan (MP), originally an indie rock club located in greater Hongdae area, is often regarded as the birthplace for underground Korean hip hop. MP worked as a site for consuming, performing and sharing hip hop music. Street hip hop events such as Everyone's Mic hosted by Hiphopplaya also took place in Hongdae. Everyone's Mic is a weekly open rap competition for underground musicians where participants perform freestyle rap based on the beat played by the DJ. Hongdae not only functioned as a tangible place for production and consumption, but also became a symbolic place for underground hip hop music and imaginary ''gohyang'' (hometown) for musicians to build their identities.\n\n=== Media Relations ===\nMedia has played a huge role in forming the Korean hip hop scene. Especially the TV program [[Show Me the Money (South Korean TV series)|Show Me The Money]] (SMTM) gained massive popularity and enabled hip hop music to be the mainstream music in Korea. However, criticism against the authenticity of the TV show resulted in the emergence of independent YouTube channels operated by hip hop labels and musicians.\n\n==== Hip hop TV shows ====\nStarted in 2012, hip hop audition programs such as [[Show Me the Money (South Korean TV series)|Show Me the Money]], [[Unpretty Rapstar]], and [[High School Rapper (TV series)|High School Rapper]] became widely popular in Korea. SMTM is an audition program for amateur and professional rappers in which top 16 rappers divide into 4 teams and compete to be the final winner.[https://web.archive.org/web/20190620090141/http://onair.mnet.com/smtm777] Unpretty Rapstar is a female counterpart of SMTM and High school Rapper is a high school version of SMTM.[http://mnettv.interest.me/unprettyrapstar3/main][http://onair.mnet.com/schoolrapper3] As of June 2019, SMTM has had seven seasons and will be airing its eighth season on August 2019. Unpretty Rapstar has had 3 seasons from 2015 and High School Rapper has had 3 seasons from 2017. These reality competition shows are produced by Mnet, Korea's largest cable music channel operated under CJ Entertainment & Media ([[CJ E&M]]), an entertainment and media conglomerate.\n\nThese TV shows changed the notion of underground and overground hip hop music in Korea. Before the show, musicians who signed with major labels and frequently appeared on TV were considered overground rappers while ones who performed on small stages and worked independently were recognized as underground rappers. However, as hip hop TV shows made hip hop music a mainstream, even the underground rappers who were critical about overground rappers gained visibility through TV and started working with pop artists. Also, with the success of SMTM, underground rappers who negatively thought of signing with labels started considering the idea due to the promise of rising profits in the genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2015/03/the-rise-of-south-korean-hip-hop-keith-ape-interview|title= The Rise of South Korean Hip Hop|last=Maher|first=D.M.|date=2015-03-02|website=UK Complex|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-24}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901583758 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895221595 cite #44 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref> For example, Deepflow of VMC who criticized overground rappers for commercializing the hip hop scene, actively participated in several hip hop TV show as a producer from 2017.[http://hiphople.com/interview/4292672] Nafla and Loopy of Mkit Rain who criticized overground rappers for joining SMTM eventually joined SMTM season 7 as participants as well.[https://news.joins.com/article/23176608] Rather than being a stage for only the overground rappers, media and TV shows are now viewed as an opportunity for all types of new rappers to gain visibility and rise to the stardom. This transition has eventually blurred the distinction between underground and overground musicians.\n\n==== Social media and [[YouTube]] ====\nSocial Media such as YouTube and Sound Cloud has been one of the main channels Korean hip hop artists present their works and communicate with its fans. Mic Swagger, a YouTube-based freestyle rapping contents that invites different hip hop musicians as guests each episode, became a huge success throughout its four seasons since 2009 and contributed to the popularization of freestyle rap.[https://www.goodbgm.com/season-1] Also, in response to the criticism against the mainstream hip hop media like Mnet, hip hop artists started creating independent channels to express their thoughts and present their music to the public. Hip hop label H1gher Music partnered with Dingo, an online media contents creator, to promote new songs independent from the mainstream media.[https://www.mk.co.kr/news/entertain/view/2017/09/616935/] In 2018, rapper Mommy Son released a song named \u201cMommy Jump\u201d through his YouTube channel after being eliminated from SMTM season 7. The song which directly condemned Mnet and SMTM became a massive hit and was nominated the hip hop song of the year with 38 million YouTube view (as of June 2019).[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3ZFtSoWtRc]\n\nRappers and idols also use social media apps as a way of connecting to their fans, creating a sense of friendship with their fans.<ref>[https://adage.com/article/global-news/marketing-s-wave-korean-pop-star/235287]</ref> The use of music streaming apps such as Soundcloud, Youtube, and Spotify can help in exposure for Korean artists, as many of these apps, especially Soundcloud, are used by young kids around the world to discover these artists. <ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/ywkx4m/hip-hop-dont-stop-korean-style]</ref> Much of the music on these apps provide a similar sound to American rap music, which is popular not only for American teenagers but teenagers abroad as well. [https://medium.com/@juhapetteri.raatikainen/the-rise-of-korean-rap-culture-6df2afaf3b3a] There is also room for more experimentation on music platforms such as Souncloud because artists are able to upload their own work and express their creativity in a way they could not in the Korean idol system and form a deeper connection with their audiences with their work, as well as promote their solo work. [https://seoulbeats.com/2017/05/soundcloud-and-k-pop-where-artists-can-experiment/]\n\nThe emergence of bilingual Korean rappers also helps bridge the gap between Korean and American hip hop music along with social media. They can communicate with American fans in a way most non-English speaking Korean rappers cannot. Korean rapper DPR live explained his newfound presence in the US with his first-ever concert, by saying \u201cI always thought, you know, me being bilingual, just looking at the quality of both musics, it\u2019s both up to par. But Korean music has just as nice flavor, amazing qualities. [It's] just the world doesn\u2019t know yet. And obviously America is everywhere. Everyone knows. And I\u2019m just excited to close the gap a little more.\u201d [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8260874/dpr-live-action-crew-interview-sxsw]\n\n=== Overlap with [[K-pop]] Industry ===\nIn its early days, most Korean hip hop fell into a category called \"rap dance,\" where artists mixed rapping with pop music.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1DeCQAAQBAJ|title=Globalization and Popular Music in South Korea: Sounding Out K-Pop|last=Fuhr|first=Michael|date=2015-06-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317556916}}</ref> Many [[K-pop]] artists incorporated rap into their music, from Seo-taji and Jinusean in 1990s to [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] and [[Block B]] in 2010s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/2015-the-year-korean-rap-broke|title=2015 Was Korean Rap's Breakthrough Year|last=Lee|first=Madeleine|date=2015-12-01|website=NOISEY|access-date=2016-04-27}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901583758 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895221595 cite #5 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Since the 1990s, American hip hop was brought into and spread through Korea in several channels: tangible forms of music like cassette tapes and CDs from America to Korea, individual bodies to/from America and within Korea, and virtual communities of hip hop listeners.<ref name=\"Song, My\u014fng-s\u014fn, 1986\"/> Korean Americans especially played a significant role in localizing American hip hop with their English-speaking ability and access to American culture.

His mother Anne de Theys died when he was eight, and because his father was a soldier, he went to a boarding school for his education.<ref name=huntington/> Guillaume retired from the world to the Augustinian monastery of Villard-Beno\u00eet, near Grenoble, and took his son Hugh, with him.<ref name=\"butler\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07519c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Saint Hugh of Lincoln|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Hugh became a religious novice and was ordained a [[deacon]] at the age of nineteen. About 1159, he was sent to be [[prior]] of the nearby monastery at [[Saint-Maximin, Is\u00e8re|Saint-Maximin]], presumably already a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]. From that community, he left the [[Benedictine Order]] and entered the [[Grande Chartreuse]],<ref name=BHOLincoln/> then at the height of its reputation for the rigid austerity of its rules and the earnest piety of its members. There he rose to become [[procurator (Catholic Church)|procurator]] of his new Order, in which office he served until he was sent in 1179 to become [[prior]] of the [[Witham Charterhouse]] in Somerset, the first Carthusian house in England.<ref name=BHOLincoln/>\n\n[[Henry II of England]], as part of his penance for the murder of [[Thomas Becket]], in lieu of going on crusade as he had promised in his first remorse, had established a [[Carthusian]] [[Monastery|charterhouse]] some time before, which was settled by monks brought from the Grande Chartreuse. There were difficulties in advancing the building works, however, and the first prior was retired and a second soon died. It was by the special request of the English king that St Hugh, whose fame had reached him through one of the nobles of Maurienne, was made prior.<ref name=butler/>\n\nHugh found the monks in great straits, living in log huts and with no plans yet advanced for the more permanent monastery building. Hugh interceded with the king for royal patronage and at last, probably on 6 January 1182, Henry issued a charter of foundation and endowment for Witham Charterhouse.  His first attention was given to the building of the Charterhouse. He prepared his plans and submitted them for royal approbation, exacting full compensation from the king for any tenants on the royal estate who would have to be evicted to make room for the building.<ref name=butler/> Hugh presided over the new house till 1186 and attracted many to the [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]. Among the frequent visitors was King Henry, for the charterhouse lay near the borders of the king's chase in [[Selwood Forest]], a favourite hunting ground. Hugh admonished Henry for keeping dioceses vacant in order to keep their income for the royal chancellery.\n\nIn May 1186, Henry summoned a council of bishops and barons at [[Eynsham]] Abbey to deliberate on the state of the Church and the filling of vacant bishoprics, including Lincoln. On 25 May 1186 the [[cathedral chapter]] of Lincoln was ordered to elect a new bishop and Hugh was elected.<ref name=BHOLincoln/> Hugh insisted on a second, private election by the [[canon (priest)|canons]], securely in their [[chapterhouse]] at Lincoln rather than in the king's chapel. His election was confirmed by the result.\n\nHugh was consecrated [[Bishop of Lincoln]] on 21 September 1186<ref name=Handbook255>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255</ref> at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]].<ref name=BHOLincoln/> Almost immediately he established his independence of the King, excommunicating a royal forester and refusing to seat one of Henry's courtly nominees as a [[prebend]]ary of Lincoln; he softened the king's anger by his diplomatic address and tactful charm. After the excommunications, he came upon the king hunting and was greeted with dour silence. He waited several minutes and the king called for a needle to sew up a leather bandage on his finger. Eventually Hugh said, with gentle mockery, \"How much you remind me of your cousins of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]]\" (where [[William I of England|William I]]'s mother [[Herleva]], a tanner's daughter, had come from). At this Henry just burst out laughing and was reconciled. As a bishop, he was exemplary, constantly in residence or travelling within his diocese, generous with his charity, scrupulous in the appointments he made. He raised the quality of education at the cathedral school.  Hugh was also prominent in trying to protect the [[Judaism in England|Jew]]s, great numbers of whom lived in Lincoln, in the persecution they suffered at the beginning of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s reign, and he put down popular violence against them\u2014as later occurred following the death of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]]\u2014in several places.\n\n[[Image:LincCathplanDehio.jpg|thumb|left|A plan of Lincoln Cathedral drawn by G Dehio (died 1932)]]\n[[Lincoln Cathedral]] had been badly damaged by an earthquake in 1185, and Hugh set about rebuilding and greatly enlarging it in the new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]; however, he only lived to see the choir well begun. In 1194, he expanded the [[St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford|St Mary Magdalen's Church]], [[Oxford]]. Along with [[bishop of Salisbury|Bishop]] [[Herbert Poore|Herbert]] of [[diocese of Salisbury|Salisbury]], Hugh resisted the [[Richard I of England|king]]'s demand for 300 [[knight]]s for a year's service in [[Richard I of England#Later years and death|his French wars]]; the entire revenue of both men's offices was then seized by royal agents.<ref>Robinson, J.

He consecrated [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], in 1200. There is a cross consisting of interlaced circles cut into the western column of the tower that is believed to commemorate this. Also in commemoration of the consecration, [[St Giles' Fair]] was established and continues to this day each September.<ref>[http://www.st-giles-church.org/fair.htm St Giles' Fair] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911004515/http://www.st-giles-church.org/fair.htm |date=11 September 2012 }}, [http://www.st-giles-church.org/ St Giles' Church].</ref> While attending a national council in London, a few months later, he was stricken with an unnamed ailment and died two months later on 16 November 1200.<ref name=Handbook255/> He was buried in [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\nBishop Hugh was responsible for the building of the first (wooden) Bishop's Palace at [[Buckden, Cambridgeshire|Buckden]] in Cambridgeshire, halfway between Lincoln and London. Later additions to the Palace were more substantial and a tall brick tower was added in 1475, protected by walls and a moat, and surrounded by an outer bailey. It was used by the bishops until 1842. The Palace, now known as [[Buckden Towers]], is owned by the [[Claretians]] and is used as a retreat and conference Centre. A Catholic church, dedicated to St Hugh, is located on the site.\n\n==Veneration==\n[[File:Tour d&#039;Avalon Saint-Maximin.jpg|thumb|Tour d&#039;Avalon, [[Saint-Maximin, Is\u00e8re]]]]\nHugh was [[canonised]] by [[Pope Honorius III]] on 17 February 1220,<ref name=BHOLincoln/> and is the [[patron saint]] of sick children, sick people, shoemakers and swans. Hugh is honoured in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Church of England]] and in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|Episcopal Church (USA)]] on 17 November.\n\nHugh's ''Vita'', or written life, was composed by his chaplain [[Adam of Eynsham]], a Benedictine monk and his constant associate; it remains in manuscript form in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford.\n\nHugh is the [[eponym]] of [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], where a 1926 statue of the saint stands on the stairs of the Howard Piper Library. In his right hand, he holds an effigy of Lincoln Cathedral, and his left hand rests on the head of a swan.\n\nAt Avalon, a round tower in the [[Gothic Revival|Romantic Gothic style]] was built by the Carthusians in 1895 in Hugh's honour on the site of the castle where he was born.<ref name=Avalon>[http://www.atelierdesdauphins.com/forts/avalon/vestiges.htm La tour d'Avalon] accessed on 28 October 2007</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\nHugh's primary emblem is a white [[swan]], in reference to the story of the swan of [[Stow, Lincolnshire|Stow]] which had a [[imprinting (psychology)|deep and lasting friendship]] with the saint, even guarding him while he slept.

About 1159, he was sent to be [[prior]] of the nearby monastery at [[Saint-Maximin, Is\u00e8re|Saint-Maximin]], presumably already a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]. From that community, he left the [[Benedictine Order]] and entered the [[Grande Chartreuse]],<ref name=BHOLincoln/> then at the height of its reputation for the rigid austerity of its rules and the earnest piety of its members. There he rose to become [[procurator (Catholic Church)|procurator]] of his new Order, in which office he served until he was sent in 1179 to become [[prior]] of the [[Witham Charterhouse]] in Somerset, the first Carthusian house in England.<ref name=BHOLincoln/>\n\n[[Henry II of England]], as part of his penance for the murder of [[Thomas Becket]], in lieu of going on crusade as he had promised in his first remorse, had established a [[Carthusian]] [[Monastery|charterhouse]] some time before, which was settled by monks brought from the Grande Chartreuse. There were difficulties in advancing the building works, however, and the first prior was retired and a second soon died. It was by the special request of the English king that St Hugh, whose fame had reached him through one of the nobles of Maurienne, was made prior.<ref name=butler/>\n\nHugh found the monks in great straits, living in log huts and with no plans yet advanced for the more permanent monastery building. Hugh interceded with the king for royal patronage and at last, probably on 6 January 1182, Henry issued a charter of foundation and endowment for Witham Charterhouse.  His first attention was given to the building of the Charterhouse. He prepared his plans and submitted them for royal approbation, exacting full compensation from the king for any tenants on the royal estate who would have to be evicted to make room for the building.<ref name=butler/> Hugh presided over the new house till 1186 and attracted many to the [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]. Among the frequent visitors was King Henry, for the charterhouse lay near the borders of the king's chase in [[Selwood Forest]], a favourite hunting ground. Hugh admonished Henry for keeping dioceses vacant in order to keep their income for the royal chancellery.\n\nIn May 1186, Henry summoned a council of bishops and barons at [[Eynsham]] Abbey to deliberate on the state of the Church and the filling of vacant bishoprics, including Lincoln. On 25 May 1186 the [[cathedral chapter]] of Lincoln was ordered to elect a new bishop and Hugh was elected.<ref name=BHOLincoln/> Hugh insisted on a second, private election by the [[canon (priest)|canons]], securely in their [[chapterhouse]] at Lincoln rather than in the king's chapel. His election was confirmed by the result.\n\nHugh was consecrated [[Bishop of Lincoln]] on 21 September 1186<ref name=Handbook255>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255</ref> at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]].<ref name=BHOLincoln/> Almost immediately he established his independence of the King, excommunicating a royal forester and refusing to seat one of Henry's courtly nominees as a [[prebend]]ary of Lincoln; he softened the king's anger by his diplomatic address and tactful charm. After the excommunications, he came upon the king hunting and was greeted with dour silence. He waited several minutes and the king called for a needle to sew up a leather bandage on his finger. Eventually Hugh said, with gentle mockery, \"How much you remind me of your cousins of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]]\" (where [[William I of England|William I]]'s mother [[Herleva]], a tanner's daughter, had come from). At this Henry just burst out laughing and was reconciled. As a bishop, he was exemplary, constantly in residence or travelling within his diocese, generous with his charity, scrupulous in the appointments he made. He raised the quality of education at the cathedral school.  Hugh was also prominent in trying to protect the [[Judaism in England|Jew]]s, great numbers of whom lived in Lincoln, in the persecution they suffered at the beginning of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s reign, and he put down popular violence against them\u2014as later occurred following the death of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]]\u2014in several places.\n\n[[Image:LincCathplanDehio.jpg|thumb|left|A plan of Lincoln Cathedral drawn by G Dehio (died 1932)]]\n[[Lincoln Cathedral]] had been badly damaged by an earthquake in 1185, and Hugh set about rebuilding and greatly enlarging it in the new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]; however, he only lived to see the choir well begun. In 1194, he expanded the [[St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford|St Mary Magdalen's Church]], [[Oxford]]. Along with [[bishop of Salisbury|Bishop]] [[Herbert Poore|Herbert]] of [[diocese of Salisbury|Salisbury]], Hugh resisted the [[Richard I of England|king]]'s demand for 300 [[knight]]s for a year's service in [[Richard I of England#Later years and death|his French wars]]; the entire revenue of both men's offices was then seized by royal agents.<ref>Robinson, J.

He consecrated [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], in 1200. There is a cross consisting of interlaced circles cut into the western column of the tower that is believed to commemorate this. Also in commemoration of the consecration, [[St Giles' Fair]] was established and continues to this day each September.<ref>[http://www.st-giles-church.org/fair.htm St Giles' Fair] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911004515/http://www.st-giles-church.org/fair.htm |date=11 September 2012 }}, [http://www.st-giles-church.org/ St Giles' Church].</ref> While attending a national council in London, a few months later, he was stricken with an unnamed ailment and died two months later on 16 November 1200.<ref name=Handbook255/> He was buried in [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\nBishop Hugh was responsible for the building of the first (wooden) Bishop's Palace at [[Buckden, Cambridgeshire|Buckden]] in Cambridgeshire, halfway between Lincoln and London. Later additions to the Palace were more substantial and a tall brick tower was added in 1475, protected by walls and a moat, and surrounded by an outer bailey. It was used by the bishops until 1842. The Palace, now known as [[Buckden Towers]], is owned by the [[Claretians]] and is used as a retreat and conference Centre. A Catholic church, dedicated to St Hugh, is located on the site.\n\n==Veneration==\n[[File:Tour d&#039;Avalon Saint-Maximin.jpg|thumb|Tour d&#039;Avalon, [[Saint-Maximin, Is\u00e8re]]]]\nHugh was [[canonised]] by [[Pope Honorius III]] on 17 February 1220,<ref name=BHOLincoln/> and is the [[patron saint]] of sick children, sick people, shoemakers and swans. Hugh is honoured in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Church of England]] and in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|Episcopal Church (USA)]] on 17 November.\n\nHugh's ''Vita'', or written life, was composed by his chaplain [[Adam of Eynsham]], a Benedictine monk and his constant associate; it remains in manuscript form in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford.\n\nHugh is the [[eponym]] of [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], where a 1926 statue of the saint stands on the stairs of the Howard Piper Library. In his right hand, he holds an effigy of Lincoln Cathedral, and his left hand rests on the head of a swan.\n\nAt Avalon, a round tower in the [[Gothic Revival|Romantic Gothic style]] was built by the Carthusians in 1895 in Hugh's honour on the site of the castle where he was born.<ref name=Avalon>[http://www.atelierdesdauphins.com/forts/avalon/vestiges.htm La tour d'Avalon] accessed on 28 October 2007</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\nHugh's primary emblem is a white [[swan]], in reference to the story of the swan of [[Stow, Lincolnshire|Stow]] which had a [[imprinting (psychology)|deep and lasting friendship]] with the saint, even guarding him while he slept.

The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed [[Drop (liquid)|teardrops]].  Hershey's KISSES chocolates are wrapped in squares of lightweight [[aluminium foil|aluminum foil]].  A narrow strip of paper called a plume sticks out from the top of each Hershey KISS wrapper.   Originally designed as a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, the printed paper plumes were added to the KISSES product wrapper in 1921 in order to distinguish the Hershey's KISS from its competitors who offered similar products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/hersheyarchives30-18-only-hersheys-kisses-are-kisses/|title=HersheyArchives@30, Part 18: Only Hershey\u2019s Kisses are Kisses \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Hershey Kisses Ad photographed March 23 2013-8579.jpg|thumb|left|Old Hershey Kisses [[advertising|ad]]]]\n\nWhen first manufactured in 1907, the Hershey KISSES were wrapped by hand but in 1921, a machine was made so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. This machinery also added the paper plume or paper strip flag to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify the Hershey's KISS, replacing the original small square of printed tissue that was inside the foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/its-the-cocoa-bean-baby/|title=It\u2019s the Cocoa Bean, Baby \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref> In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey's KISSES foil wrapper.\n\nIn 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for \"foil wrapped conical configuration with plume\" which included the KISSES paper plume sticking out from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=doc&state=4805:8klpj5.2.1|title=TESS -- Error|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov}}</ref> \n\nDuring 1942, production of Hershey Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were re-purposed to create [[military chocolate (United States)]] D ration bars for the soldiers in World War II. According to military historians, these chocolate D rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency ration.  The ingredients of these four ounce bars were a blend of chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk powder and oat flour containing 600 calories.  The specification for the D ration chocolate bars was that it had to \u201ca little better than a boiled potato\u201d so troops would only use them for emergencies.<ref>https://www.interesly.com/military-chocolate-bar-boiled-potato/</ref>  By the end of World War II, Hershey's had produced more than 3 billion D ration chocolate bars.<ref>https://www.history.com/news/hersheys-chocolate-allied-d-day-rations-wwii</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the 5th most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 70 million Hershey's Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company's two factories. Today's Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey's original [[milk chocolate]] formula.\n\nIn 2005 [[Hershey's Kissables]] were introduced as a smaller sized, candy coated version of Kisses chocolates. They were discontinued in 2009.\n{{-}}\n\n==Kisses brand varieties==\n[[Image:HolidayHersheyKissCarmel.jpg|thumb|Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates filled with [[caramel]].]]\n\nThough originally made of solely [[milk chocolate]], many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials.

The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed [[Drop (liquid)|teardrops]].  Hershey's KISSES chocolates are wrapped in squares of lightweight [[aluminium foil|aluminum foil]].  A narrow strip of paper called a plume sticks out from the top of each Hershey KISS wrapper.   Originally designed as a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, the printed paper plumes were added to the KISSES product wrapper in 1921 in order to distinguish the Hershey's KISS from its competitors who offered similar products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/hersheyarchives30-18-only-hersheys-kisses-are-kisses/|title=HersheyArchives@30, Part 18: Only Hershey\u2019s Kisses are Kisses \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Hershey Kisses Ad photographed March 23 2013-8579.jpg|thumb|left|Old Hershey Kisses [[advertising|ad]]]]\n\nWhen first manufactured in 1907, the Hershey KISSES were wrapped by hand but in 1921, a machine was made so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. This machinery also added the paper plume or paper strip flag to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify the Hershey's KISS, replacing the original small square of printed tissue that was inside the foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/its-the-cocoa-bean-baby/|title=It\u2019s the Cocoa Bean, Baby \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref> In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey's KISSES foil wrapper.\n\nIn 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for \"foil wrapped conical configuration with plume\" which included the KISSES paper plume sticking out from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=doc&state=4805:8klpj5.2.1|title=TESS -- Error|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov}}</ref> \n\nDuring 1942, production of Hershey Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were re-purposed to create [[military chocolate]] D ration bars for the soldiers in World War II. According to military historians, these chocolate D rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency ration.  The ingredients of these four ounce bars were a blend of chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk powder and oat flour containing 600 calories.  The specification for the D ration chocolate bars was that it had to \u201ca little better than a boiled potato\u201d so troops would only use them for emergencies.<ref>https://www.interesly.com/military-chocolate-bar-boiled-potato/</ref>  By the end of World War II, Hershey's had produced more than 3 billion D ration chocolate bars.<ref>https://www.history.com/news/hersheys-chocolate-allied-d-day-rations-wwii</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the 5th most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 70 million Hershey's Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company's two factories. Today's Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey's original [[milk chocolate]] formula.\n\nIn 2005 [[Hershey's Kissables]] were introduced as a smaller sized, candy coated version of Kisses chocolates. They were discontinued in 2009.\n{{-}}\n\n==Kisses brand varieties==\n[[Image:HolidayHersheyKissCarmel.jpg|thumb|Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates filled with [[caramel]].]]\n\nThough originally made of solely [[milk chocolate]], many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" labeled plume and silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]]Hershey's KISSES wrappers have a paper strip called a plume sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.

His half-sister is the actress [[Monika Hansen]]. Called Jonny by his parents, he adopted the name Buchardt as his [[stage name]]. This was the surname of the partner of Claire Schlichting's second husband's mother. With his stepfather, the dancer Erik Hansen, Buchardt also performed together under this name.<ref>Ben Becker: Na und, ich tanze, Verlag Droemer, 2011, S. 36 ff</ref>\n\nBuchardt's most famous sketch, the \"gin number\", was a pretend advertisement for [[Gordon's Gin]]. This sketch showed a very formal and smooth-talking presenter, who promoted Gordon's Gin as \"sooo gentle\". However, over several commercial breaks, the spokesman became increasingly drunk and lost control over his body and pronunciation.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tELW1n5auQU</ref>\n\nJonny Buchardt was a notable figure at the [[Cologne Carnival]]. In one appearance as MC in 1973, he after priming the audience to answer his calls of \"[[de:Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi|Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi]]\" and \"[[Cheering|Hip hip... hurray]]\", he got them to shout \"[[Nazi salute#Sieg Heil|Sieg heil]]\".

His half-sister is the actress [[Monika Hansen]]. Called Jonny by his parents, he adopted the name Buchardt as his [[stage name]]. This was the surname of the partner of Claire Schlichting's second husband's mother. With his stepfather, the dancer Erik Hansen, Buchardt also performed together under this name.<ref>Ben Becker: Na und, ich tanze, Verlag Droemer, 2011, S. 36 ff</ref>\n\nBuchardt's most famous sketch, the \"gin number\", was a pretend advertisement for [[Gordon's Gin]]. This sketch showed a very formal and smooth-talking presenter, who promoted Gordon's Gin as \"sooo gentle\". However, over several commercial breaks, the spokesman became increasingly drunk and lost control over his body and pronunciation.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tELW1n5auQU</ref>\n\nJonny Buchardt was a notable figure at the [[Cologne Carnival]]. In one appearance as MC in 1973, he after priming the audience to answer his calls of \"[[de:Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi|Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi]]\" and \"[[Cheering|Hip hip... hurray]]\", he got them to shout \"[[Nazi salute#Sieg Heil|Sieg heil]]\".
