The six groups (A to F) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. In the new format, however, the four best third-ranked sides also progress, leaving 16 teams going into the new round-of-16 knockout phases, ahead of the usual quarter-finals, semi-finals and final, and only 8 teams going out at the group stage.<ref name=\"Infantino format\">{{cite news |first=Martyn |last=Ziegler |title=Uefa admit expansion of European Championships to 24 teams 'not ideal' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/uefa-admit-expansion-of-european-championships-to-24-teams-not-ideal-7594801.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London |date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref> The format is exactly the one that was applied to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], and [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]s, except for the absence of a [[third place play-off]].\n\nThis format generates a total of 51 matches, compared with 31 matches for the previous 16-team tournament, to be played over a period of 31 days. [[UEFA]]'s general secretary [[Gianni Infantino]] previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they need to progress out of the group, leading to a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.<ref>Grundy (2014), 195\u2013197</ref>{{efn|Oliver MacDonagh says that ''Sense and Sensibility'' \"may well be the first English realistic novel\" based on its detailed and accurate portrayal of what he calls \"getting and spending\" in an English gentry family.<ref name=\"MacDonagh 1991, 65, 136\u2013137\">MacDonagh (1991), 65, 136\u2013137.</ref>}} Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=2|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref>\n\nWith the publications of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811),  ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'', and another unfinished novel, ''[[The Watsons]]''. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref> They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership.

Ostensibly, Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 270; Nokes (1998), 1; Le Faye (2005), 33</ref>{{efn| Important details about the Austen family were almost certainly elided by intention, such as mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or mention of the sisters' wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\">Nokes (1998), 1\u20132; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134</ref>}} Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed.

The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral [[Francis Austen]], destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters'', published in 1913.<ref>Nokes (1998), 2\u20134; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134; Le Faye (2004), 279</ref> The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life.<ref name=Fergus(2005)3ff/> Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family\".<ref>Fergus (2005), 4</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life==\n{{further|Timeline of Jane Austen}}\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Chawton Church, Steventon, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] Church, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]''<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\">Le Faye (2004), 20</ref>]]\n\nJane Austen was born in [[Steventon, Hampshire]], on 16 December 1775.

Over the centuries as each generation of [[primogeniture|eldest sons]] received inheritances, their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered [[St John's College, Oxford]] on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827).<ref>Le Faye (2004), 3\u20135, 11</ref> She came from the prominent [[Baron Leigh|Leigh]] family; her father was rector at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where she grew up among the gentry.

They left for Hampshire the same day.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11; Nokes (1998), 24, 26</ref>\n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small ''per annum'' living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 12; Nokes (1998), 24</ref> The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations.

See Le Faye, 29\u201336}} Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 29</ref>\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return,  \"...&nbsp;and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 46</ref> Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 26</ref>\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.<ref>Honan (1987), 14, 17\u201318; Collins (1994), 54.</ref> The Reverend Austen had an annual income of \u00a3200 from his two livings.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\">Irvine (2005) p.2</ref> This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about \u00a3100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\"/>\n\nDuring this period of her life, Austen attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours,{{efn|For social conventions among the gentry generally, see Collins (1994), 105}} and read novels\u2014often of her own composition\u2014aloud with her family in the evenings.

Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library.  Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqu\u00e9 experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.<ref>Honan (1987), 66\u201368; Collins (1994), 43</ref>\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775) and [[David Garrick]]'s ''[[Bon Ton (play)|Bon Ton]]''.

Austen biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Told in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration dramatists]] who may have provided some of her inspiration&nbsp;...

He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a [[barrister]]. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"<ref>Quoted in Le Faye (2004), 92.</ref>\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\".<ref name = \"halperin721\">Halperin (1985), 721</ref> Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".<ref name = \"halperin721\"/>\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xviii; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 112\u2013120, 159; Honan (1987), 105\u2013111.</ref> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.<ref name = \"halperin722\">Halperin (1985), 722</ref>\n\n===Early manuscripts (1796\u20131798)===\nAfter finishing ''Lady Susan'', Austen began her first full-length novel ''Elinor and Marianne''. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]''.<ref>Sutherland (2005), 16\u201318; LeFaye (2014), xviii; Tomalin (1997), 107, 120, 154, 208.</ref>\n\nAusten began a second novel, ''First Impressions'' (later published as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 100, 114.</ref> At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to [[Thomas Cadell (publisher)|Thomas Cadell]], an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing ''First Impressions''. Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\".

She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near [[Basingstoke]]. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive\u2014he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xxi; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 178\u2013181; Honan (1987), 189\u2013198.</ref> No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal.<ref>Le Faye (2005), 51.</ref> Irvine described Bigg-Wither as a somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".<ref>Irvine (2005), 3</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him.

The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters.

Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen (known as Frank) pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters.<ref>Honan (1987), 213\u2013214.</ref> For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and [[Godmersham Park|Godmersham]]. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of [[Worthing]], on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage.{{efn|Austen's observations of early Worthing probably helped inspire her final, but unfinished novel, ''[[Sanditon]]'', the story of an up-and-coming seaside resort in Sussex.}} It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of ''Lady Susan'' and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806 the family moved to [[Southampton]], where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife.

Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the \u00a310 he had paid her and find another publisher.

Through her brother Henry, the publisher [[Thomas Egerton (publisher)|Thomas Egerton]] agreed to publish ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', which, like all of Jane Austen's novels except ''Pride and Prejudice'', was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.<ref>Fergus (2014), 6; Raven (2005), 198; Honan (1987), 285\u2013286.</ref> The alternative to selling via commission was the selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\">Irvine, 2005 13.</ref> Austen's experience with ''Susan'' (the manuscript that became ''Northanger Abbey'') where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\"/>  ''Sense and Sensibility'' appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/>\n\n[[File:SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg|left|upright=.85|thumb|First edition title page from ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', Austen's first published novel (1811)]]\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers;<ref name=\"Honan 1987, 289\u2013290\">Honan (1987), 289\u2013290.</ref> the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or less to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of ''Sense and Sensibility'' to about 2,000 copies of ''Emma''. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen's books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.<ref>For more information and a discussion of the economics of book publishing during this period, see Fergus (2014), 6\u20137, and Raven (2005), 196\u2013203.</ref>\n\nAusten made \u00a3140 from ''Sense and Sensibility'',<ref>Irvine (2005) p.15</ref> which provided her with some financial and psychological independence.<ref>Honan (1987), 290, Tomalin (1997), 218.</ref> After the success of ''Sense and Sensibility'', all of Austen's subsequent books were billed as written \"By the author of ''Sense and Sensibility''\" and Austen's name never appeared on her books during her lifetime.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> Egerton then published ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', a revision of ''First Impressions'', in January 1813.

Yet in ''Northanger Abbey'' she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale.

The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam (1987), 99\u2013100; see also Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Gilson (2005), 149\u201350; Johnson (2014), 239.</ref>\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles' ''Jane Austen and Her Art'', the academic study of Austen took hold.<ref>Southam (1987), 107\u2013109, 124.</ref> Lascelles's work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work as well as an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.<ref>Southam (1986), 108; Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Stovel (2014), 248; Southam (1987), 127</ref>\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including [[feminist theory]], and perhaps most controversially, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]]. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern [[Janeite]]s, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably.<ref>Rajan (2005), 101\u2013110</ref> After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 210.</ref> As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966\u201369, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 212.</ref> In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 213.</ref> A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative.<ref name=\"Koppel\">{{cite web\n| last =  Koppel\n| first = Gene\n| title = Pride and Prejudice: Conservative or Liberal Novel\u2014Or Both?

From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations.<ref>Lynch (2005), 160\u2013162.</ref> The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's ''Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance'', and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, ''The Bennets'' (1901).<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 85.</ref> The first film adaptation was the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 MGM production of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]].<ref>Brownstein (2001), 13.</ref> BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings.<ref>Troost (2007), 79.</ref> The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of ''Pride and Prejudice'' and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nFrom 1995 many Austen adaptations appeared, with [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|film of ''Sense and Sensibility'']], for which screenwriter and star [[Emma Thompson]] won an [[Academy Award]], and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', starring [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]].<ref>Troost (2007), 82\u201384.</ref> A 2005 British production of [[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|''Pride and Prejudice'']], directed by [[Joe Wright]] and starring [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Matthew Macfadyen]],<ref>Carol Kopp, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/15/oscar/main1321171.shtml \"The Nominees: Keira Knightley\"], CBS News, 20 October 2008.</ref> was followed in 2007 by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park (2007 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey (2007 film)|Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (2007 film)|Persuasion]]'',<ref>Julia Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV \"ITV falls in love with Jane Austen\"], ''The Guardian'', 10 November 2005.</ref> and in 2016 by ''[[Love & Friendship]]'', a film version of ''Lady Susan'' that borrowed the title of Austen's ''[[Love and {{Not a typo|Freindship}}]]'' [sic].<ref>Alonso Duralde, Alonso, [http://www.thewrap.com/love-friendship-review-whit-stillman-kate-beckinsale-chloe-sevigny-jane-austen/ \"'Love & Friendship' Sundance Review: Whit Stillman Does Jane Austen\u2014But Hasn't He Always?\"], ''The Wrap'', 25 January 2016.</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\nAusten is on the [[Bank of England \u00a310 note|\u00a310 note]] which was introduced in 2017, replacing [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-14/jane-austen-is-now-on-the-10-pound-note/8947154|title=Jane Austen is now on Britain's 10 pound note|date=14 September 2017|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/jane-austen-banknote-unveiled-with-strange-choice-of-quotation|title=Jane Austen banknote unveiled \u2013 with strange choice of quotation|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=18 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/new-10-note-spot-worth-thousands/|title=New \u00a310 note: how to spot if yours is worth thousands|last=Suter|first=Laura|date=13 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n==List of works==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n'''Novels'''\n* ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811)\n* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813)\n* ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814)\n* ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815)\n* ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1871, posthumous)\n\n'''Unfinished fiction'''\n* ''[[The Watsons]]'' (1804)\n* ''[[Sanditon]]'' (1817)\n\n'''Other works'''\n* ''Sir Charles Grandison'' ([[The History of Sir Charles Grandison|adapted]] play) (1793, 1800){{efn|The full title of this short play is ''Sir Charles Grandison or The happy Man, a Comedy in 6 acts''.

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.<ref>Grundy (2014), 195\u2013197</ref>{{efn|Oliver MacDonagh says that ''Sense and Sensibility'' \"may well be the first English realistic novel\" based on its detailed and accurate portrayal of what he calls \"getting and spending\" in an English gentry family.<ref name=\"MacDonagh 1991, 65, 136\u2013137\">MacDonagh (1991), 65, 136\u2013137.</ref>}} Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=2|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref>\n\nWith the publications of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811),  ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'', and another unfinished novel, ''[[The Watsons]]''. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref> They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired many critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' to more recent productions like ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' (1996), ''[[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1999), ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005), ''[[Love & Friendship]]'' (2016), and [[Emma (2020 film)|''Emma''.]]{{refn|name=Period|group=lower-alpha|The title of the film has a [[full stop|period]] attached to signify it being a [[period piece]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2020-02-14/emma-title-full-stop-period/|title=Emma. director Autumn de Wilde explains the film\u2019s unusual punctuation|website=Radio Times}}</ref>}} (2020).\n\n==Biographical sources==\n[[File:Letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, 1799 June 11.

Ostensibly, Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 270; Nokes (1998), 1; Le Faye (2005), 33</ref>{{efn| Important details about the Austen family were almost certainly elided by intention, such as mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or mention of the sisters' wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\">Nokes (1998), 1\u20132; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134</ref>}} Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little with which to work.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\"/>\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitised the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral [[Francis Austen]], destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters'', published in 1913.<ref>Nokes (1998), 2\u20134; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134; Le Faye (2004), 279</ref> The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life.<ref name=Fergus(2005)3ff/> Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family\".<ref>Fergus (2005), 4</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life==\n{{further|Timeline of Jane Austen}}\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Chawton Church, Steventon, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] Church, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]''<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\">Le Faye (2004), 20</ref>]]\n\nJane Austen was born in [[Steventon, Hampshire]], on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27; Nokes (1998), 51</ref> The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27</ref>\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, [[George Austen (clergyman)|George Austen]] (1731\u20131805), served as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] parishes at Steventon and at nearby [[Deane, Hampshire|Deane]].<ref>Todd (2015), 2</ref>{{efn|Irene Collins estimates that when George Austen took up his duties as rector in 1764, Steventon comprised no more than about thirty families.<ref>Collins (1994), 86</ref>}} He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of [[primogeniture|eldest sons]] received inheritances, their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered [[St John's College, Oxford]] on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827).<ref>Le Faye (2004), 3\u20135, 11</ref> She came from the prominent [[Baron Leigh|Leigh]] family; her father was rector at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where she grew up among the gentry.

They left for Hampshire the same day.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11; Nokes (1998), 24, 26</ref>\n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small ''per annum'' living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 12; Nokes (1998), 24</ref> The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations.

[[Henry Thomas Austen|Henry]] was the first child to be born there, in 1771.<ref>Nokes (1998), 37; Le Faye (2004), 25</ref> At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and mute, and she chose to send him out to be fostered.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 22</ref> In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by [[Francis Austen|Francis]] in 1774, and Jane in 1775.<!-- don't forget Charles?? source? --><ref>Nokes (1998), 37; Le Faye (2004), 24\u201327</ref>\n\nAccording to Honan, the atmosphere of the Austen home was an \"open, amused, easy intellectual\" one, where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.<ref>Honan (1987), 211\u2013212</ref> The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members.<ref name = \"Todd4\">Todd (2015), 4</ref> Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter [[Eliza de Feuillide|Eliza]], accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly.<ref>Nokes (1998), 39; Le Faye (2004), 22\u201323</ref>{{efn|Philadelphia had returned from India in 1765 and taken up residence in London; when her husband returned to India to replenish their income, she stayed in England.  He died in India in 1775, with Philadelphia unaware until the news reached her a year later, fortuitously as George and Cassandra were visiting. See Le Faye, 29\u201336}} Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 29</ref>\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return,  \"...&nbsp;and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 46</ref> Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"<ref>Le Faye (2004), 26</ref>\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.<ref>Honan (1987), 14, 17\u201318; Collins (1994), 54.</ref> The Reverend Austen had an annual income of \u00a3200 from his two livings.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\">Irvine (2005) p.2</ref> This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about \u00a3100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000.<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 p.2\"/>\n\nDuring this period of her life, Austen attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours,{{efn|For social conventions among the gentry generally, see Collins (1994), 105}} and read novels\u2014often of her own composition\u2014aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the [[assembly rooms]] in the town hall.<ref>Tomalin (1997), 101\u2013103, 120\u2013123, 144; Honan (1987), 119.</ref> Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".<ref>Quoted in Tomalin (1997), 102; see also Honan (1987), 84</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:CassandraAustenSilhouette.png|thumb|Silhouette of [[Cassandra Austen]], Jane's sister and closest friend]]\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to [[Oxford]] to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to [[Southampton]] when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught [[typhus]] and Austen nearly died.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 47\u201349; Collins (1994), 35, 133.</ref> Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] with her sister early in 1785 at the [[Reading Abbey Girls' School]], ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre.<ref>Todd (2015), 3</ref> The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama.

Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library.  Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqu\u00e9 experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.<ref>Honan (1987), 66\u201368; Collins (1994), 43</ref>\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775) and [[David Garrick]]'s ''[[Bon Ton (play)|Bon Ton]]''. Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xvi\u2013xvii; Tucker (1986), 1\u20132; Byrne (2002), 1\u201339; Gay (2002), ix, 1; Tomalin (1997), 31\u201332, 40\u201342, 55\u201357, 62\u201363; Honan (1987), 35, 47\u201352, 423\u2013424, n. 20.</ref><!-- check all these refs --> Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated.<ref>Honan (1987), 53\u201354; Lascelles (1966), 106\u2013107; Litz (1965), 14\u201317.</ref><!-- check all these refs --> At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.<ref>Tucker (1986), 2</ref>\n\n===Juvenilia (1787\u20131793)===\n\nFrom the age of eleven, and perhaps earlier, Austen wrote poems and stories for her own and her family's amusement.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 66; Litz (1986), 48; Honan (1987), 61\u201362, 70; Lascelles (1966), 4; Todd (2015), 4</ref> In these works, the details of daily life are exaggerated, common plot devices are parodied, and the \"stories are full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to [[Janet Todd]].<ref>Todd (2015), 4\u20135</ref> Austen later{{When|date=April 2018}} compiled [[Foul papers|fair copies]] of twenty-nine early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the ''[[Juvenilia (Austen)|Juvenilia]]'', containing work written between 1787 and 1793.

Austen biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Told in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration dramatists]] who may have provided some of her inspiration&nbsp;...

He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a [[barrister]]. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"<ref>Quoted in Le Faye (2004), 92.</ref>\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\".<ref name = \"halperin721\">Halperin (1985), 721</ref> Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".<ref name = \"halperin721\"/>\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xviii; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 112\u2013120, 159; Honan (1987), 105\u2013111.</ref> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.<ref name = \"halperin722\">Halperin (1985), 722</ref>\n\n===Early manuscripts (1796\u20131798)===\nAfter finishing ''Lady Susan'', Austen began her first full-length novel ''Elinor and Marianne''. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]''.<ref>Sutherland (2005), 16\u201318; LeFaye (2014), xviii; Tomalin (1997), 107, 120, 154, 208.</ref>\n\nAusten began a second novel, ''First Impressions'' (later published as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 100, 114.</ref> At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to [[Thomas Cadell (publisher)|Thomas Cadell]], an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing ''First Impressions''. Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\".

She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near [[Basingstoke]]. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive\u2014he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xxi; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 178\u2013181; Honan (1987), 189\u2013198.</ref> No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal.<ref>Le Faye (2005), 51.</ref> Irvine described Bigg-Wither as a somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".<ref>Irvine (2005), 3</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him.

The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters.

Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen (known as Frank) pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters.<ref>Honan (1987), 213\u2013214.</ref> For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and [[Godmersham Park|Godmersham]]. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of [[Worthing]], on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage.{{efn|Austen's observations of early Worthing probably helped inspire her final, but unfinished novel, ''[[Sanditon]]'', the story of an up-and-coming seaside resort in Sussex.}} It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of ''Lady Susan'' and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806 the family moved to [[Southampton]], where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife.

Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the \u00a310 he had paid her and find another publisher.

Through her brother Henry, the publisher [[Thomas Egerton (publisher)|Thomas Egerton]] agreed to publish ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', which, like all of Jane Austen's novels except ''Pride and Prejudice'', was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.<ref>Fergus (2014), 6; Raven (2005), 198; Honan (1987), 285\u2013286.</ref> The alternative to selling via commission was the selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\">Irvine, 2005 13.</ref> Austen's experience with ''Susan'' (the manuscript that became ''Northanger Abbey'') where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\"/>  ''Sense and Sensibility'' appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/>\n\n[[File:SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg|left|upright=.85|thumb|First edition title page from ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', Austen's first published novel (1811)]]\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers;<ref name=\"Honan 1987, 289\u2013290\">Honan (1987), 289\u2013290.</ref> the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or less to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of ''Sense and Sensibility'' to about 2,000 copies of ''Emma''. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen's books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.<ref>For more information and a discussion of the economics of book publishing during this period, see Fergus (2014), 6\u20137, and Raven (2005), 196\u2013203.</ref>\n\nAusten made \u00a3140 from ''Sense and Sensibility'',<ref>Irvine (2005) p.15</ref> which provided her with some financial and psychological independence.<ref>Honan (1987), 290, Tomalin (1997), 218.</ref> After the success of ''Sense and Sensibility'', all of Austen's subsequent books were billed as written \"By the author of ''Sense and Sensibility''\" and Austen's name never appeared on her books during her lifetime.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> Egerton then published ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', a revision of ''First Impressions'', in January 1813.

Yet in ''Northanger Abbey'' she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale.

The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam (1987), 99\u2013100; see also Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Gilson (2005), 149\u201350; Johnson (2014), 239.</ref>\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles' ''Jane Austen and Her Art'', the academic study of Austen took hold.<ref>Southam (1987), 107\u2013109, 124.</ref> Lascelles's work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work as well as an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.<ref>Southam (1986), 108; Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Stovel (2014), 248; Southam (1987), 127</ref>\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including [[feminist theory]], and perhaps most controversially, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]]. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern [[Janeite]]s, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably.<ref>Rajan (2005), 101\u2013110</ref> After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 210.</ref> As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966\u201369, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 212.</ref> In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pp. 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 p. 213.</ref> A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative.<ref name=\"Koppel\">{{cite web\n| last =  Koppel\n| first = Gene\n| title = Pride and Prejudice: Conservative or Liberal Novel\u2014Or Both?

From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations.<ref>Lynch (2005), 160\u2013162.</ref> The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's ''Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance'', and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, ''The Bennets'' (1901).<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 85.</ref> The first film adaptation was the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 MGM production of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]].<ref>Brownstein (2001), 13.</ref> BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings.<ref>Troost (2007), 79.</ref> The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of ''Pride and Prejudice'' and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nFrom 1995 many Austen adaptations appeared, with [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|film of ''Sense and Sensibility'']], for which screenwriter and star [[Emma Thompson]] won an [[Academy Award]], and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', starring [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]].<ref>Troost (2007), 82\u201384.</ref> A 2005 British production of [[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|''Pride and Prejudice'']], directed by [[Joe Wright]] and starring [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Matthew Macfadyen]],<ref>Carol Kopp, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/15/oscar/main1321171.shtml \"The Nominees: Keira Knightley\"], CBS News, 20 October 2008.</ref> was followed in 2007 by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park (2007 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey (2007 film)|Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (2007 film)|Persuasion]]'',<ref>Julia Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV \"ITV falls in love with Jane Austen\"], ''The Guardian'', 10 November 2005.</ref> and in 2016 by ''[[Love & Friendship]]'', a film version of ''Lady Susan'' that borrowed the title of Austen's ''[[Love and {{Not a typo|Freindship}}]]'' [sic].<ref>Alonso Duralde, Alonso, [http://www.thewrap.com/love-friendship-review-whit-stillman-kate-beckinsale-chloe-sevigny-jane-austen/ \"'Love & Friendship' Sundance Review: Whit Stillman Does Jane Austen\u2014But Hasn't He Always?\"], ''The Wrap'', 25 January 2016.</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\nAusten is on the [[Bank of England \u00a310 note|\u00a310 note]] which was introduced in 2017, replacing [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-14/jane-austen-is-now-on-the-10-pound-note/8947154|title=Jane Austen is now on Britain's 10 pound note|date=14 September 2017|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/jane-austen-banknote-unveiled-with-strange-choice-of-quotation|title=Jane Austen banknote unveiled \u2013 with strange choice of quotation|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=18 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/new-10-note-spot-worth-thousands/|title=New \u00a310 note: how to spot if yours is worth thousands|last=Suter|first=Laura|date=13 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=4 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n==List of works==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n'''Novels'''\n* ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811)\n* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813)\n* ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814)\n* ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815)\n* ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1818, posthumous)\n* ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1871, posthumous)\n\n'''Unfinished fiction'''\n* ''[[The Watsons]]'' (1804)\n* ''[[Sanditon]]'' (1817)\n\n'''Other works'''\n* ''Sir Charles Grandison'' ([[The History of Sir Charles Grandison|adapted]] play) (1793, 1800){{efn|The full title of this short play is ''Sir Charles Grandison or The happy Man, a Comedy in 6 acts''.

The damaged [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] [[Cylon Basestar#Battlestar Galactica (2004\u20132009)|Basestar]] has arrived at the same location as the [[Twelve Colonies|Colonial]] ship ''Demetrius.'' [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] and Lt. [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Athena]] talk with Capt. [[Karl Agathon|Helo]], the [[executive officer]] of the ''Demetrius,'' and remind him that both ships must [[Jump drive|jump]] at the same time so that they arrive back at the Colonial Fleet together. If the Cylon basestar arrives alone, the ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' will attack the damaged basestar and likely destroy it.\n\nThe ships jump, but the ''Demetrius'' suffers a mechanical error which prevents it from jumping. The basestar arrives in the midst of the Colonial Fleet. ''Galactica'' launches its fighters and prepares to fire its weapons at the Cylon vessel. Just as the ''Galactica'' is about to fire on the defenseless Cylon vessel, [[Saul Tigh|Col. Tigh]] orders a halt to the attack, surprising Adm. [[William Adama]]. Just then, the ''Demetrius'' jumps into the battle and Helo communicates with the ''Galactica,'' advising the Colonial ship that the basestar is under the control of Capt. Thrace.\n\nLt. [[Felix Gaeta|Gaeta]], shot in the lower leg by [[Samuel Anders|Anders]] in the previous episode, is quickly taken into surgery aboard the ''Galactica.'' His leg is amputated below the right knee, traumatizing him.\n\nColonial troops board and take control of the Cylon ship. Adm. Adama, [[Laura Roslin|President Roslin]], Col. Tigh, and presidential aide Tory Foster interview [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Natalie|Natalie]], one of the [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Sixes]] and leader of the rebel Cylons. She tells them of the Cylon civil war and the rebels' desire to find the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The \"Final Five\" (Numbers Seven, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve) Humanoid Cylons|Final Five]] Cylons, whom they believe will help them find Earth. Adama and Roslin express disbelief that the Cylon rebels can be trusted, but Natalie offers them proof of her goodwill: The \"Final Five,\" she says, are somewhere in the human fleet.  Natalie offers to take the ''Galactica'' to the Hub, which is a nexus of operations for all Cylon \"resurrection ships.\" If the Hub is destroyed, the resurrection ships will cease to function and all Cylons will become mortal. Natalie tells them that the Hub is also where the deactivated [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Threes]] known as D'Anna Biers are located, who know the faces of the Final Five. Roslin and Adama agree to the plan.\n\nRoslin, Athena and Caprica-Six once again have their shared dream in which Athena and Roslin chase Athena's half-human, half-Cylon child, [[Hera Agathon]], through the opera house only to have Caprica-Six take the child into a brilliantly-lit auditorium. This time, however, Gaius Baltar is seen waiting at the entrance of the brilliantly lit door, walking away with Six and Hera. When Athena awakens from her dream, she finds Hera by her bedside. Hera whispers, \"Bye-bye.\"\n\nStarbuck visits Roslin and tells her that [[Cylon Basestar#The Hybrid|the Cylon Hybrid]] prophesied \"the dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house\". A startled Roslin asks for Thrace's help in unraveling the meaning of her vision, and Thrace agrees to do so.\n\nNatalie is brought in to meet the Quorum. She tells the Quorum that the Cylon rebels have realized that death is an important part of life. The Cylons have begun to cherish every moment of the life, now that they realize they might permanently die. They no longer wish to engage in war, but need humanity's help to not only help them find Earth but also bring this realization to all Cylons everywhere. The stratagem seems to work, and Roslin gets the support of the Quorum.\n\nLt. Sharon Agathon arrives home in her quarters aboard the ''Galactica'' to find her daughter, Hera, coloring in a book. When she looks at the book, it's filled with childish drawings of the Cylon Six model and the number six repeated over and over. Athena looks up to find Hera gone. She runs through the ship, trying to find her daughter. In a corridor, Hera meets Natalie, who's being escorted by several Colonial Marines. Hera stops and Natalie kneels to greet the child. Athena rushes up and pulls a gun on Natalie.  She announces Natalie will not take her child. Natalie says she does not want the child, but Athena shoots her twice and Natalie is dying.\n\nAboard the Cylon basestar, Roslin, Baltar, and the leader of the Eights arrive in the Hybrid's room.  Roslin orders the Hybrid reconnected to the Basestar's systems. As soon as the Hybrid wakes up, it screams \"Jump!\" The Basestar then jumps away from the Fleet.\n\n==External links==\n* [[BattlestarWiki:Guess What's Coming to Dinner?|\"Guess What's Coming to Dinner?\"]] at Battlestar Wiki\n* [http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/episodes/season/4/episode/409/guess_what_s_coming_to_dinner \"Guess What's Coming to Dinner?\"] at [[Syfy]]\n* {{tv.com episode|battlestar-galactica/guess-whats-coming-to-dinner-1192823}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0993929}}\n\n{{Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes}}\n\n[[Category:2008 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Battlestar Galactica (season 4) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the 1967 Academy Award-winning film|Guess Who's Coming to Dinner}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{notability|Television|date=December 2016}}\n{{long plot|date=December 2016}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox television episode \n| title =Guess What's Coming to Dinner?\n| image = \n| caption =\n| series =Battlestar Galactica\n| season =4\n| episode =9\n| airdate =May 16, 2008\n| production = \n| writer = [[Michael Angeli]]\n| director = Wayne Rose\n| guests = \n| season_article = Battlestar Galactica (season 4)\n| episode_list = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes\n| prev =[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]\n| next =[[Sine Qua Non (Battlestar Galactica)|Sine Qua Non]] \n}}\n\n'''\"Guess What's Coming to Dinner?\"''' is the ninth episode in the fourth season of the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.

Originally a PhD thesis, the author adapted it into a book.<ref name=\"Financial-Times\">{{cite news |last1=Ben-Ami |first1=Daniel |title=Free market defined |url=https://www.ft.com/content/519636d2-4298-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |publisher=Financial Times |date=13 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Prospect\">{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Jennifer |title=The Measure of All Things |url=https://prospect.org/article/measure-all-things |accessdate=3 August 2019 |publisher=The American Prospect |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism began after the [[Great Depression]] as a movement of intellectuals committed to protecting [[liberalism|liberal]] values of [[individual liberty]] and [[limited government]], which they believed were threatened in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]] by expanding government. They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied? The Transformation of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy in the United States and Britain, 1945\u20132000\") considers the effects of neoliberal policies on housing and [[urban policy]] in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n* The conclusion (\"The Legacy of Transatlantic Neoliberalism: Faith-Based Policy\") discusses the lasting effects of neoliberalism and lays out the author's belief in the need to return \"reason-based policymaking\" to political and economic debates.\n\n==Summary==\n{{Quote box|quote = \"Neoliberalism was a radical form of [[individualism]] that was first generated before World War II in reaction to [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]], [[Progressivism]], the [[New Deal]], and the onset of [[Nazi]] and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]].

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Instead, it acted as \"a siren call, a warning about the tragic possibilities of moving in the direction\" of greater collectivist government intervention \"which Western politics, economy, and society seemed to be moving.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|84}} Importantly, Jones argues it helped to \"create a transatlantic neoliberal network that would...combat the [[New Deal]] and social-democratic political establishments in Britain and the United States\", \"combat the forces of [[collectivism]]\", and refine neoliberal thought into a workable set of policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|32}}\n\n===Second phase: Emergence of a transatlantic neoliberal network (1950\u20131980)===\nJones outlines how a transatlantic network of neoliberal intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments, and think tanks arose between 1950 and 1980 and, building on the foundations of the critiques of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] of the early neoliberals, refined and popularized neoliberal ideas to the point that \"they eventually seemed the natural alternative to liberal or [[social democracy|social democratic]] policies\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|153}} This network would serve \"almost like a kind of Neoliberal International\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|218}} that would be highly influential in the later adoption of neoliberal policies by the governments of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} During this time, the locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to America, with the American economist [[Milton Friedman]] becoming its most influential proponent\u2014its \"beating heart\", as Jones describes it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|135}} Neoliberalism, according to Jones, evolved from an attempt to find a middle way between [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and collectivism into a \"faith in free markets\", often articulating \"individual liberty in apocalyptic terms as a struggle between free societies and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|345,116}} Neoliberals of the era emphasized the need to recover \"lost truths\" from [[classical liberalism]], including the value of [[individual liberty]], the [[invisible hand]] of the free market, and the virtues of [[limited government]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101}} By the 1960s, Jones contends, neoliberal thought had established a \"distinct and coherent identity\" centered around \"individual liberty, free markets, spontaneous order, the price mechanism, competition, consumerism, deregulation, and rational self-interest\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|132}} Additionally, during this period a body of policy prescriptions was injected into neoliberalism.\n\nJones points to an early essay by [[Milton Friedman]] entitled [https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 \"Neoliberalism and its Prospects\"] as a \"bridge\" between the first phase of neoliberal thought\u2014dominated by European conerns\u2014and the second phase, centered in the United States and concerned more with economic freedom and the superiority of markets.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}} Jones considers the essay a \"useful marker of the moment when neoliberalism became a self-conscious political and economic concept in the United States\", as it was one of the first instances in which an American writer claimed the neoliberal moniker.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} In the essay Friedman makes a quintessentially first-phase argument for a \"new faith\" between [[collectivism]], which he believed leads to an over-mighty state, and [[laissez-faire]] economics, which he believed fostered the development of over-mighty individuals.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton |title=Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects |url=https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=Farmand |date=17 February 1951}}</ref><ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} However, the essay marked a \"symbolic cutting off point\" in neoliberal thought, signifying the point in time when neoliberalism began to shift away from the early \"middle way\" arguments to a more strident belief in free markets. Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] and more by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory of [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents. This \"pave[d] the way for the later electoral successes of Ronald Reagan,\" which would usher in neoliberal policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\n===Third phase: Policy implementation (1980 onward)===\n{{Quote box|quote = \"The demise of the postwar economic settlement had been hastened by a series of catastrophic events: the [[Vietnam War]], the first [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock of 1973]], and the near collapse of [[industrial relations]] in Britain.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], and [[trade union]] reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \"powerfully compelling logic\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|15}} Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|13}}\n[[Image:US Historical Inflation.svg|thumb|Rate of inflation in the United States (1914-2009)|left]]\n\nNeoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president [[Jimmy Carter]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[James Callaghan]].

They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied?

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony.

Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] and more by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents. This \"pave[d] the way for the later electoral successes of Ronald Reagan,\" which would usher in neoliberal policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\n===Third phase: Policy implementation (1980 onward)===\n{{Quote box|quote = \"The demise of the postwar economic settlement had been hastened by a series of catastrophic events: the [[Vietnam War]], the first [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock of 1973]], and the near collapse of [[industrial relations]] in Britain.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], and [[trade union]] reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \"powerfully compelling logic\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|15}} Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|13}}\n[[Image:US Historical Inflation.svg|thumb|Rate of inflation in the United States (1914-2009)|left]]\n\nNeoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president [[Jimmy Carter]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[James Callaghan]].
