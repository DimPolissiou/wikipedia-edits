Design media are affiliated through the International Design Media Network (IDMN).<ref name=\"IcogradaAbout\" />\n\n==ico-D Members==\nThe International Council of Design is an organisation of organisations. The Council has over 120 Member organisations in over 50 countries. As a representative body, the Assembly of its Members is its highest power and has the ultimate decision on all matters that govern the Council. The organisations that make up this membership are national-level Professional Associations, Educational Institutions and Promotional Bodies. As the core membership category, Professional Associations representing individual professional designers and design studios, have particular powers within the Assembly. \n\n[[File:ICO_Congress_1966.png|thumb|Icograda Congress 1966]]\n\n==International affiliations==\nico-D coordinates best international practices for professional design.

''ico-D Meetings'' offer a variety of ways for representatives of Members organisations and the design community to connect. ''ico-D Meetings'' are attended by, on average, 30-70 organisation representatives speaking on behalf of their design communities. There are several categories of Meetings that respond to specific needs.\n\n''ico-D Platform Meetings'' (PMs) gather ico-D Members at one place and time, every year, to explore common challenges and action for change. ''ico-D Regional Meetings'' (RMs) provide an opportunity for ico-D Members located in the same region to engage with the design community at the regional level on common topics and challenges. ''ico-D Special Meetings'' (SMs) foster collaboration and exchange between various promotion and valorisation entities (Design Weeks, Festivals, Museums, Cities, and more) to address overlapping challenges and objectives and to determine how the international design community can better collaborate to achieve mutual goals and tackle shared challenges.\n\n''ico-D General Meetings'' (GM) assemble Members on issues of governance and policy. The General Assembly (GA) and Annual General Meeting (AGM) happen on alternating years.\n\n<gallery>\nICO_RM2017_Santiago.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 Latin America\nICO_RM2017_Asean.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 ASEAN\nICO_RM2019_Porto_01.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\nICO_RM2019_Porto_02.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Professional design practice==\n\nThe International Council of Design maintains that design is a profession. Like architects, doctors or lawyers, they advocate that designers have obligations and responsibilities that they must adhere to, to maintain their professional standing. The Council advocates that the title of \u201cdesigner\" implies adherence to a code of professional behaviour that ties their professional practice to obligations towards society at large. \n\nThe Council publishes a series of white papers, Best Practice documents governing the professional conduct of the individual designer as well the organisation of [http://dash.ico-d.org/files/resources/BP/ICO_RES_BP_Organising_Design_Awards_Competitions.pdf design awards], [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_DesignConferenceGuidelines.pdf design conferences] and [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_ExhibitionGuidelines.pdf design exhibits]. One of these is a [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_CodeofConduct.pdf Code of Conduct for professional designers].\n\n\n==Publications==\nReflecting its origins as the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), the Council has a long history of having publications. The earliest iteration of this is \"Icographic\" which was founded in 1971 and subsequent iterations include \"Iridescent\" and \"Communication Design\".\n\n===Icographic===\nFounded by John Halas, and edited and designed by Patrick Wallis Burke, ''Icographic'' was a review of international visual communication. Published by Pergamon Press Limited (Oxford/ New York/ Paris/ Frankfurt). The publication was quarterly at its inception and then became bi-annual. In its inaugural issue it was stated that the new magazine \"intends to study this field [newsprint and publishing industries as well as television, cinema and computers] as well as examine the designer\u2019s role in it. It will attempt to serve as an organ expressing the designer\u2019s point of view in the new scene. It will attempt to reveal new ideas in the technical aspect of design and to become an essential information source in the area of visual communications to many of our members throughout the world.\"\n\n[[File:Icographic issue 1 (1971).png|thumb|Icographic issue 1 (1971)]]\n\nThere were 14 issues of ''Icographic'' printed between 1971 and 1978. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/icographic#icographic-1-1971 back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n<gallery>\nIcographic issue 2 (1971).png\nIcographic 08 (1974).png\nIcographic 12 (1978).png\n</gallery>\n\n===Iridescent===\n''Iridescent: Icograda Journal of Design Research'', was the second iteration of the Council's design research journal. Coined the \u201cprism on design research\u201d the publication aimed to break boundaries and was. Considered a new a global take on the future of design with the aim of \u201cbreaking boundaries\u201d, Iridescent was born out of the Council\u2019s strategic aim to develop communication design education by merging the interdisciplinary facets of theory, practice and research. Initiated by Russell Kennedy (Icograda President 2009\u20132011), Edited by Omar Vulpinari (Icograda Vice President 2009-2011) and printed by [[Fabrica]], this beautiful limited edition work includes papers by Elizabeth Tunstall, Lawrence Zeegan, Zhao Jian, and many more.\n\nThe journal existed in paper and digital form, running from 2009 to 2011. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/iridescent back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n===Communication Design===\nIn 2016, the third iteration of the journal, ''Communication Design, Interdisciplinary and Graphic Design Research'' was launched, a significant evolution that builds upon a dynamic publishing history in the Council. The initiative was led by Editor-in-chief Teal Triggs of the Royal College of Art and supported by an accomplished editorial team, including leading authors on design. Triggs aimed to revisit what we mean by the term \u2018communication design\u2019, and to take into consideration the nature of design as an ever-expanding and -becoming practice, noting that the future of design is broadening from the design of the visual to also include the design of sound, haptics, experiences and services. And as a result, she says \u201cit might be argued that the term \u2018communication design\u2019 better describes and supports a range of new kinds of practices, processes, and methods.\u201d The journal was published by Routledge/ Taylor Francis until 2019.\n\n\n==World Design Day==\nA concept developed in 1995 by Kim Paulsen (Vice President 1993-1995) to commemorate the foundation of the Council on 27 April 1963, the day was initially as \"World Graphics Day\", became \"World Communication Design Day\" in 2012 and has been \"World Design Day\" since 2015.\n\nThe goal of World Design Day is to challenge designers to reflect deeply on the well-being of people within their local environments, and to find innovative solutions to local needs by using design as a vehicle to honour diversity, transcend borders, and improve quality of life. Held annually on 27 April, participants worldwide are invited to gather, innovate, and live out a moment of design by organizing public events and initiatives.\n\n===Themes===\n* 2015: How are you designing today?\n* 2016: Design in Action!\n* 2017: Start Young\n* 2018: Kids can too!\n* 2019: Women in design\n* 2020: Be Professional!\n\n\n==Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration==\n\nThe Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration proclaims the potential of design to achieve global economic, social, environmental and cultural objectives and includes a dramatic call to action to professionals, educators and governments as well as a list of proposed projects.The signing ceremony of the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was conducted on 24 October 2017 in Montr\u00e9al (Canada). Ratified in the presence of three UN agencies (UNESCO, UN-Habitat, UN Environment) the document was signed by the fourteen international organisations and partners who collaborated to draft the document and four additional design organisations. The Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration lists in an Annex more than 600 national professional associations, universities and design promotion entities, from 89 countries, that are represented by these international organisations.\n\nThe Declaration is a Call to Action. On one hand, it is a call to governments, educators, civil and private sectors to engage with  design, utilise and recognise it through Design Advocacy, Development of Design Metrics, Development of Design Policies, Development of Design Standards, Enhancement of Design Education. It is also a call to designers themselves to step into a leadership role, reconceiving themselves as \u201cambassadors\u201d of end-users, calling for more Responsive, Responsible and Vigilant Design, and Recognition of Design in the face of global challenges.\n\nThe Montreal Design Declaration defines the '''Value of Design''' through eight bold propositions:\n# Design is a driver of innovation and competition, growth and development, efficiency and prosperity.\n# Design is an agent for sustainable solutions.\n# Design expresses culture. \n# Design adds value to technology.\n# Design facilitates change.\n# Design introduces intelligence to cities.\n# Design addresses resiliency and manages risk.\n# Design fosters development. \n\nAccording to then President of the International Council of Design, Mr David Grossman: \u201cThe Declaration reflects two grand achievements. For the first time, the design community, across many disciplines, is speaking with one voice. This consolidation permits the second achievement - the international agencies are eager to collaborate with a united design world. These achievements impact every designer.\u201d  The Montreal Design Declaration is a milestone marking the launch of a global collaborative effort to utilise the potential of design for the benefit of all, and concludes: \"All people deserve to live in a well-designed world.\u201d \n\nThe first Design Declaration Summit in Montr\u00e9al, where the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was signed was organised with a Steering Committee made up of the International Council of Design, the [[Ifhp|International Federation for Housing an Planning]] and the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]].\n\n\n==Secretariat==\n\nInitially based in London (United Kingdom), the Secretariat of the International Council of Design was in Brussels (Belgium) from 1999 to 2005, at which time it moved to Montr\u00e9al (Canada), where it still resides. The Montr\u00e9al Secretariat is situated on a pedestrian street in the old town part of the city at 50 rue le Royer West. \n\nThe Secretariat office is where all the staff of the Council is based.

From 2015 onwards, management of the Secretariat has been in the hands of Ana Masut. \n\n\n==Executive Board==\nico-D's Executive Board consists of individuals who are duly nominated and elected by ico-D's Member organisations at the biennial ico-D General Assembly. Members of the Executive Board serve in a volunteer position and donate their time and expertise to further Icograda's mandate. Board meetings are typically held four times a year in different locations around the world, usually in conjunction with regional meetings, seminars or other scheduled design events.\n\n===Executive Board 2019\u22122021===\n* Mr. Johnathon Strebly (Canada), President\n* Ms. Daniela Piscitelli (Italy), Secretary General\n* Ms. Rebecca Blake (Unites States), Treasurer\n* Mr. Essam Abu Awad (Jordan), Vice President\n* Mr. Jonas Liugaila (Lithuania), Vice President\n* Ms. Zinnia Nizar (Indonesia), Vice President\n* Mr. Ting Xu (China), Vice President\n* Mr. Chao Zhao (China), Vice President\n* Mr. David Grossman (Israel), Executive Board Member\n\n===Executive Board history===\nSince 1963 and 2016, 26 ico-D boards have donated their leadership skills and time to furthering ico-D's goals and objectives.

In addition, the production of ''Equality of Man'', a film project for students and young people in support of the United Nations Human Rights Year, was the first of several Icograda collaborations with [http://asifa.net/ International Animated Film Association (ASIFA)]\n\nThe third Icograda Congress 'Design Destinations in a Changing World' was held in 1968 in Eindhoven.<ref name=\"CongressHistory\" /> An exhibition of Belgian graphics was organised by Michel Olyff at the same time and the entire congress decamped to Brussels for a day. \"Sachez que tout en ce monde n\u2019est que signes et signes de signes\" (beware that all in the world is only signs and signs of signs), were the words of Marcel Schwab quoted by Alderman van der Harten in opening the congress. Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, \"but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored. A government minister failed to appear to make an address on the third morning of the congress; he was in an emergency cabinet meeting.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stephen Hitchins, Icograda board member 1987-1991</ref>\n\nIcograda has always been totally non-political but the 1968 Congress coincided with the end of the [[Prague Spring]]. As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.\n\nAt the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 }}</ref> In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}</ref> by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that \"the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week.\"\n\nThe first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.\n\nIn 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.\n\nIn 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.\n\nIn 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from D\u00fcsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.\n\nIn 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.\n\nThe 1977 Zurich Congress \u2212 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' \u2212 was complemented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne \u2212 'A Town and its Image' \u2212 and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.\n\nIn 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar \u2212 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico.

The theme was 'Design Integration'. Three separate general assemblies followed the congress. At the 9th Icograda General Assembly, Stig Hogdal was elected President, Marijke Singer was once again elected Secretary-General and the President's Trophy was awarded to Geoffrey Bensusan for his work on the ''Icograda News Bulletin''. The first Icograda-Philips design award was awarded to Benoit de Pierrepont and S S Satie focusing on the theme ''The design of instructions and warnings, and the related problems of society in any area of human activity''. Also in 1981, Icograda organised a poster competition on behalf of UNESCO to celebrate the International Year of Disabled Persons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=32403&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO.ORG &#124; International Year of Disabled Persons |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref><ref>http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000483/048396eo.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1982 the first of six issues of ''icographic/volume 2'' was published on behalf of Icograda by Mobilia Press, with Jorge Frascara as associate editor. Each issue was devoted to a single theme and abstracts were included in four languages. Also in 1982, Haig David-West organised the first African regional meeting in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and in 1983, Haig David-West (the first ever elected Icograda Executive board member from Africa)<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> edited the publication ''Dialogue on graphic design problems in Africa'', based on this meeting.\n\nIn 1983 the 10th General Assembly and Icograda Congress '<nowiki/>''Design Interaction''' were held in Dublin.<ref name=\"icograda.org\"/> The keynote address was given by [[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]] of the United Nations. In one of the most remarkable addresses ever made to an Icograda congress, Childers mixed thousands of years of history with personal experience as he set out examples where \"I can tell you that again and again down the years I have confronted communication needs for which graphic visuals were indispensable \u2013 the only answer\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The global Picture, paper presented to the Icograda 1983 Dublin Congress by Erskine Childers, Director of Information, UNDP.</ref> Setting out a powerful argument for the potential of creating \"rapid economic and social development through a major effort in endogenously researched and programmed use of the visual media leading to \u2013 but in that order \u2013 literacy\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> he called on the delegates to \"offer and apply your centuries-evolved skills and sensitivities to help humanity see \u2013 literally see \u2013 both its marvelous capacity for progress and its primeval capacity for error, inhumanity, social neglect, even apocalyptic destruction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Admitting that he was presenting the delegates with challenges that were 'especially heavy' Childers said \"I never knew a good graphic designer who did not explode with creativity and blossom when faced with an ostensibly impossible task...

A multidisciplinary design competition on the theme of ''Shu/Collectivity'', held under the auspices of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and sponsored by the Japan Design Foundation, was won by Charles Owen from the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nIn 1985, the 11th Icograda Congress ''The place and influence of graphic design in everyday life'' was organised by Philippe Gentil<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> in Nice, the first time that there were major presentations from India ('design without designers' by people whose needs were too urgent to await intervention by professionals) and Australia (from boomerang to bicentenary); from the design of books in China to street signs in Buenos Aires, and provocatively 'the backside of design' \u2013 what happens after the consultant has moved on to new, more rewarding problems.

So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, \"a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry\". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over. At the 11th Icograda General Assembly (also in Nice) [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] was elected president. The President's Trophy went to Jan Railich, the chairman of the Brno Biennale.<ref name=\"icograda\" /> Also in 1985, the ''World Directory of Design Schools and Programmes'' was published jointly by Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and edited by Maarten Regouin, secretary of the Icograda Education Working Group, which also coincided with Icograda's establishment of the Design History and Design Management working groups chaired by Michael Twyman and Abe Rosenfeld respectively.\n\nIn 1986 Icograda Excellence Awards were made for the first time at the Brno and Warsaw Biennales.

The other is Yuri Soloviev's story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday.

In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15\u201316 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.\n\nIn March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting. Smaller versions of the ''Design Perspectives'' seminar were also hosted in Victoria, Canada, as well as in Seattle, USA. The Icograda Design Week in Brno took place from 17\u201321 June in the Czech Republic. The event included ''Over the fence: Design in Central and Eastern Europe'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar, a Regional Meeting attended by delegates from eight countries, the ''Identity/Integrity Icograda Conference'', ''East Meets West, Icograda Student Workshop'', a symposium and inauguration of the Icograda Education Network (IEN) and a workshop to conceptualise the formation of the International Design Media Network (IDMN). The Design Week was further preceded by a joint meeting of the boards of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, resulting in the conceptualisation of the International Design Alliance (IDA) and the Host City Project to establish a joint Icograda/ICSID Secretariat.\n\nIn September of the same year, the Icograda board embarked on a three-week visit to China and Taiwan where they presented a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar in Beijing, ''logo2002: Identity and Communication Conference,'' and met with various Chinese design stakeholders aiming to seed the formation of new professional associations. In addition Icograda presented the ''Branding and Innovalue'' seminar and an Asian Regional Meeting in Taipei, followed by a Design Education Symposium and Student Workshop in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Furthermore, the Icograda, ICSID and IFI presidents met on several occasions in Hornbaek, Denmark, to develop a Joint Resolution aimed at establishing the International Design Alliance and launching the Host City Project to establish a joint Secretariat in one location.\n\nThe year's activities ended with the hosting of a Regional Meeting, and ''Graphic Design for Social Causes'' workshop co-hosted by Design for the World as well as a ''Design Perspectives'' Seminar in Barcelona, Spain which attracted delegates from 15 countries.\n\nIn January 2003 Icograda initiated two surveys focusing on ''Design for Social Causes'' and ''Members\u2019 interest and activity in sustainability issues''. In March, the Board visited India where they met with various Indian design stakeholders in Mumbai to seed the formation of new associations, followed by further meetings and co-hosting the ''Brands-Identities-Graphics 2003'', Icograda ''Design Perspective'' Seminar in Ahmedabad. The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.\n\nThe ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8\u201311 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003\u22122005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.\n\nIn January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey. The Week's programme included ''6 Alfabe, Icograda Student Workshop'', an IEN Symposium, Regional Meeting, ''Building Bridges: Icograda Design Conference'', ''Design Perspectives Icograda Regional Design Seminar'', as well as the launch of the Icograda Design Media Network (IDMN). This was followed by the Icograda Design Week in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in April of the same year. The Week's programme included ''The Language of the City Student Workshop'', a Latin American Regional Meeting, ''Design in Latin America Regional Design Seminar'', and the ''Fronteiras! Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations\u2019 Secretariates to Montreal.\n\nIn January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport \u2013 Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L. Peters]], published by Rockport, was also published and INDIGO (International Indigenous Design Network) was conceptualised.\n\n''Era '05'' was another major collaborative effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI to stage a fifth Joint Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1023.htm |title=2005 - COPENHAGEN (DENMARK) |publisher=Icograda |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.\n\nIn 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks. In January, ''So Tiny, So Many: Icograda Design Week in Hong Kong'' took place in China and consisted of a student workshop, an evening lecture series and a Regional Meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1025.htm |title=2006 - HONG KONG (CHINA) |publisher=Icograda |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> In July, ''Defining design on a changing planet: Icograda Design Week in Seattle'', took place in the USA.

''ico-D Meetings'' are attended by, on average, 30-70 organisation representatives speaking on behalf of their design communities. There are several categories of Meetings that respond to specific needs.\n\n''ico-D Platform Meetings'' (PMs) gather ico-D Members at one place and time, every year, to explore common challenges and action for change. ''ico-D Regional Meetings'' (RMs) provide an opportunity for ico-D Members located in the same region to engage with the design community at the regional level on common topics and challenges. ''ico-D Special Meetings'' (SMs) foster collaboration and exchange between various promotion and valorisation entities (Design Weeks, Festivals, Museums, Cities, and more) to address overlapping challenges and objectives and to determine how the international design community can better collaborate to achieve mutual goals and tackle shared challenges.\n\n''ico-D General Meetings'' (GM) assemble Members on issues of governance and policy. The General Assembly (GA) and Annual General Meeting (AGM) happen on alternating years.\n\n<gallery>\nICO_RM2017_Santiago.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 Latin America\nICO_RM2017_Asean.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2017 ASEAN\nICO_RM2019_Porto_01.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\nICO_RM2019_Porto_02.jpg|ico-D Regional Meeting 2019 Europe\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Professional design practice==\n\nThe International Council of Design maintains that design is a profession. Like architects, doctors or lawyers, they advocate that designers have obligations and responsibilities that they must adhere to to maintain their professional standing. The Council advocates that the title of \u201cdesigner\" implies adherence to a code of professional behaviour that ties their professional practice to obligations towards society at large. \n\nThe Council publishes a series of white papers, Best Practice documents governing the professional conduct of the individual designer as well the organisation of [http://dash.ico-d.org/files/resources/BP/ICO_RES_BP_Organising_Design_Awards_Competitions.pdf design awards], [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_DesignConferenceGuidelines.pdf design conferences] and [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_ExhibitionGuidelines.pdf design exhibits]. One of these is a [https://www.ico-d.org/database/files/library/icoD_BP_CodeofConduct.pdf Code of Conduct for professional designers].\n\n\n==Publications==\nReflecting its origins as the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), the Council has a long history of having publications. The earliest iteration of this is \"Icographic\" which was founded in 1971 and subsequent iterations include \"Iridescent\" and \"Communication Design\".\n\n===Icographic===\nFounded by John Halas, and edited and designed by Patrick Wallis Burke, ''Icographic'' was a review of international visual communication. Published by Pergamon Press Limited (Oxford/ New York/ Paris/ Frankfurt). The publication was quarterly at its inception and then became bi-annual. In its inaugural issue it was stated that the new magazine \"intends to study this field [newsprint and publishing industries as well as television, cinema and computers] as well as examine the designer\u2019s role in it. It will attempt to serve as an organ expressing the designer\u2019s point of view in the new scene. It will attempt to reveal new ideas in the technical aspect of design and to become an essential information source in the area of visual communications to many of our members throughout the world.\"\n\n[[File:Icographic issue 1 (1971).png|thumb|Icographic issue 1 (1971)]]\n\nThere were 14 issues of ''Icographic'' printed between 1971 and 1978. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/icographic#icographic-1-1971 back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n<gallery>\nIcographic issue 2 (1971).png\nIcographic 08 (1974).png\nIcographic 12 (1978).png\n</gallery>\n\n===Iridescent===\n''Iridescent: Icograda Journal of Design Research'', was the second iteration of the Council's design research journal. Coined the \u201cprism on design research\u201d the publication aimed to break boundaries and was. Considered a new a global take on the future of design with the aim of \u201cbreaking boundaries\u201d, Iridescent was born out of the Council\u2019s strategic aim to develop communication design education by merging the interdisciplinary facets of theory, practice and research. Initiated by Russell Kennedy (Icograda President 2009\u20132011), Edited by Omar Vulpinari (Icograda Vice President 2009-2011) and printed by [[Fabrica]], this beautiful limited edition work includes papers by Elizabeth Tunstall, Lawrence Zeegan, Zhao Jian, and many more.\n\nThe journal existed in paper and digital form, running from 2009 to 2011. The entire [https://www.ico-d.org/resources/iridescent back-catalogue] is available on the website of the Council. \n\n===Communication Design===\nIn 2016, the third iteration of the journal, ''Communication Design, Interdisciplinary and Graphic Design Research'' was launched, a significant evolution that builds upon a dynamic publishing history in the Council. The initiative was led by Editor-in-chief Teal Triggs of the Royal College of Art and supported by an accomplished editorial team, including leading authors on design. Triggs aimed to revisit what we mean by the term \u2018communication design\u2019, and to take into consideration the nature of design as an ever-expanding and -becoming practice, noting that the future of design is broadening from the design of the visual to also include the design of sound, haptics, experiences and services. And as a result, she says \u201cit might be argued that the term \u2018communication design\u2019 better describes and supports a range of new kinds of practices, processes, and methods.\u201d The journal was published by Routledge/ Taylor Francis until 2019.\n\n\n==World Design Day==\nA concept developed in 1995 by Kim Paulsen (Vice President 1993-1995) to commemorate the foundation of the Council on 27 April 1963, the day was initially as \"World Graphics Day\", became \"World Communication Design Day\" in 2012 and has been \"World Design Day\" since 2015.\n\nThe goal of World Design Day is to challenge designers to reflect deeply on the well-being of people within their local environments, and to find innovative solutions to local needs by using design as a vehicle to honour diversity, transcend borders, and improve quality of life. Held annually on 27 April, participants worldwide are invited to gather, innovate, and live out a moment of design by organizing public events and initiatives.\n\n===Themes===\n* 2015: How are you designing today?\n* 2016: Design in Action!\n* 2017: Start Young\n* 2018: Kids can too!\n* 2019: Women in design\n* 2020: Be Professional!\n\n\n==Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration==\n\nThe Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration proclaims the potential of design to achieve global economic, social, environmental and cultural objectives and includes a dramatic call to action to professionals, educators and governments as well as a list of proposed projects.The signing ceremony of the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was conducted on 24 October 2017 in Montr\u00e9al (Canada). Ratified in the presence of three UN agencies (UNESCO, UN-Habitat, UN Environment) the document was signed by the fourteen international organisations and partners who collaborated to draft the document and four additional design organisations. The Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration lists in an Annex more than 600 national professional associations, universities and design promotion entities, from 89 countries, that are represented by these international organisations.\n\nThe Declaration is a Call to Action. On one hand, it is a call to governments, educators, civil and private sectors to engage with  design, utilise and recognise it through Design Advocacy, Development of Design Metrics, Development of Design Policies, Development of Design Standards, Enhancement of Design Education. It is also a call to designers themselves to step into a leadership role, reconceiving themselves as \u201cambassadors\u201d of end-users, calling for more Responsive, Responsible and Vigilant Design, and Recognition of Design in the face of global challenges.\n\nThe Montreal Design Declaration defines the '''Value of Design''' through eight bold propositions:\n# Design is a driver of innovation and competition, growth and development, efficiency and prosperity.\n# Design is an agent for sustainable solutions.\n# Design expresses culture. \n# Design adds value to technology.\n# Design facilitates change.\n# Design introduces intelligence to cities.\n# Design addresses resiliency and manages risk.\n# Design fosters development. \n\nAccording to then President of the International Council of Design, Mr David Grossman: \u201cThe Declaration reflects two grand achievements. For the first time, the design community, across many disciplines, is speaking with one voice. This consolidation permits the second achievement - the international agencies are eager to collaborate with a united design world. These achievements impact every designer.\u201d  The Montreal Design Declaration is a milestone marking the launch of a global collaborative effort to utilise the potential of design for the benefit of all, and concludes: \"All people deserve to live in a well-designed world.\u201d \n\nThe first Design Declaration Summit in Montr\u00e9al, where the Montr\u00e9al Design Declaration was signed was organised with a Steering Committee made up of the International Council of Design, the [[Ifhp|International Federation for Housing an Planning]] and the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]].\n\n\n==Secretariat==\n\nInitially based in London (United Kingdom), the Secretariat of the International Council of Design was in Brussels (Belgium) from 1999 to 2005, at which time it moved to Montr\u00e9al (Canada), where it still resides. The Montr\u00e9al Secretariat is situated on a pedestrian street in the old town part of the city at 50 rue le Royer West. \n\nThe Secretariat office is where all the staff of the Council is based. The [https://www.ico-d.org/about/people/secretariat current team] includes:\n* Ana Masut, Managing Director\n* Elizabeth Carbonell, Events Manager\n* Tara Farsky, Special Meeting Coordinator\n* Marnie Guglielmi-Vitullo, Social Media Coordinator\n* Samantha Fitzgerald, Administrator\n* Alexey Lazarev, Visual Communications Officer\n* Alisha Piercy, Communications Officer\n\n===Management===\nMary Mullins was Secretary General from 1987 to 1999.

In Montr\u00e9al, Brenda Sanderson took over this role until 2012, followed by Marilena Farruggia until 2013 and Jovana Milovi\u0107 until 2015. From 2015 onwards, management of the Secretariat has been in the hands of Ana Masut. \n\n\n==Executive Board==\nico-D's Executive Board consists of individuals who are duly nominated and elected by ico-D's Member organisations at the biennial ico-D General Assembly. Members of the Executive Board serve in a volunteer position and donate their time and expertise to further Icograda's mandate. Board meetings are typically held four times a year in different locations around the world, usually in conjunction with regional meetings, seminars or other scheduled design events.\n\n===Executive Board 2019\u22122021===\n* Mr. Johnathon Strebly (Canada), President\n* Ms. Daniela Piscitelli (Italy), Secretary General\n* Ms. Rebecca Blake (Unites States), Treasurer\n* Mr. Essam Abu Awad (Jordan), Vice President\n* Mr. Jonas Liugaila (Lithuania), Vice President\n* Ms. Zinnia Nizar (Indonesia), Vice President\n* Mr. Ting Xu (China), Vice President\n* Mr. Chao Zhao (China), Vice President\n* Mr. David Grossman (Israel), Executive Board Member\n\n===Executive Board history===\nSince 1963 and 2016, 26 ico-D boards have donated their leadership skills and time to furthering ico-D's goals and objectives.

Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, \"but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored.

As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.\n\nAt the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 }}</ref> In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}</ref> by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that \"the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week.\"\n\nThe first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.\n\nIn 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.\n\nIn 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.\n\nIn 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from D\u00fcsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.\n\nIn 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.\n\nThe 1977 Zurich Congress \u2212 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' \u2212 was complemented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne \u2212 'A Town and its Image' \u2212 and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.\n\nIn 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar \u2212 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico.

The theme was 'Design Integration'. Three separate general assemblies followed the congress. At the 9th Icograda General Assembly, Stig Hogdal was elected President, Marijke Singer was once again elected Secretary-General and the President's Trophy was awarded to Geoffrey Bensusan for his work on the ''Icograda News Bulletin''. The first Icograda-Philips design award was awarded to Benoit de Pierrepont and S S Satie focusing on the theme ''The design of instructions and warnings, and the related problems of society in any area of human activity''.

In one of the most remarkable addresses ever made to an Icograda congress, Childers mixed thousands of years of history with personal experience as he set out examples where \"I can tell you that again and again down the years I have confronted communication needs for which graphic visuals were indispensable \u2013 the only answer\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The global Picture, paper presented to the Icograda 1983 Dublin Congress by Erskine Childers, Director of Information, UNDP.</ref> Setting out a powerful argument for the potential of creating \"rapid economic and social development through a major effort in endogenously researched and programmed use of the visual media leading to \u2013 but in that order \u2013 literacy\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> he called on the delegates to \"offer and apply your centuries-evolved skills and sensitivities to help humanity see \u2013 literally see \u2013 both its marvelous capacity for progress and its primeval capacity for error, inhumanity, social neglect, even apocalyptic destruction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Admitting that he was presenting the delegates with challenges that were 'especially heavy' Childers said \"I never knew a good graphic designer who did not explode with creativity and blossom when faced with an ostensibly impossible task... History will once again make its awesome judgement of you \u2013 but from now on with greater respect because you cannot any longer be underestimated.

So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, \"a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry\". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over.

[[Rick Poynor]] writing in ''[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/ Creative Review]'' in 2007, said it had been \u201cthe most sophisticated and future-orientated discussion of design in the UK for 15 years\u201d. Jeremy Myerson called it \"a watershed event, one of those rare occasions when the design community comes together and presses the pause button, and stops to reflect on what designers do, how things have changed, and where design practice could go in the future... It explored the limits of design. Yet it also opened up new horizons\". To quote [[Christopher Frayling]] who rounded off the event, \"Two moments from Design Renaissance will stick in my mind for a long time. One is [[Victor Papanek]] quoting in discussion [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who said, 'there is hope in honest error, none in icy perfection'. The other is Yuri Soloviev's story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday. I guess the moral of the tale is: if you are up to your neck in it \u2212 keep talking, keep persuading, grab the moment when it comes, have a healthy disregard for bureaucracy, and be a strong swimmer. Oh, and as you are swimming, try not to lose your bearings and always remember that the word 'utopia' means 'of no place at all'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs with all Icograda events, it was an invigorating experience, and it swam out into some uncharted waters.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At the 15th General Assembly held in Glasgow immediately after the Congress, Philippe Gentil was elected President.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Hiroshi Kojitani received the President's Award for his work in establishing Friends of Icograda.<ref name=\"icograda\" />\n\nFrom 23\u201327 July 1995, the 16th Icograda Congress took place in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by the General Assembly in Porto.

The theme was ''Oullim'', meaning 'great harmony'. The event was attended by around 1,600 delegates and was also the first Icograda event to be webcast live on the Internet. The Congress also included the launch of the ''Icograda Education Manifesto 2000'', which was published in 17 languages.\n\nIn 2001, Icograda held regional meetings in Zagreb, Croatia in April, and in La Habana, Cuba in June. The meeting in Cuba coincided with the establishment of a new series of seminars entitled ''Design Perspectives'' which attracted 335 delegates from 23 countries. In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15\u201316 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.\n\nIn March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting.

The Design Week was further preceded by a joint meeting of the boards of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, resulting in the conceptualisation of the International Design Alliance (IDA) and the Host City Project to establish a joint Icograda/ICSID Secretariat.\n\nIn September of the same year, the Icograda board embarked on a three-week visit to China and Taiwan where they presented a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar in Beijing, ''logo2002: Identity and Communication Conference,'' and met with various Chinese design stakeholders aiming to seed the formation of new professional associations. In addition Icograda presented the ''Branding and Innovalue'' seminar and an Asian Regional Meeting in Taipei, followed by a Design Education Symposium and Student Workshop in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Furthermore, the Icograda, ICSID and IFI presidents met on several occasions in Hornbaek, Denmark, to develop a Joint Resolution aimed at establishing the International Design Alliance and launching the Host City Project to establish a joint Secretariat in one location.\n\nThe year's activities ended with the hosting of a Regional Meeting, and ''Graphic Design for Social Causes'' workshop co-hosted by Design for the World as well as a ''Design Perspectives'' Seminar in Barcelona, Spain which attracted delegates from 15 countries.\n\nIn January 2003 Icograda initiated two surveys focusing on ''Design for Social Causes'' and ''Members\u2019 interest and activity in sustainability issues''. In March, the Board visited India where they met with various Indian design stakeholders in Mumbai to seed the formation of new associations, followed by further meetings and co-hosting the ''Brands-Identities-Graphics 2003'', Icograda ''Design Perspective'' Seminar in Ahmedabad. The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.\n\nThe ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8\u201311 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003\u22122005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.\n\nIn January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey.

The Week's programme included ''The Language of the City Student Workshop'', a Latin American Regional Meeting, ''Design in Latin America Regional Design Seminar'', and the ''Fronteiras! Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations\u2019 Secretariates to Montreal.\n\nIn January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport \u2013 Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L.

A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.\n\nIn 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks.

With \u00a312&nbsp;million of Lottery funding to invest over three years, the fund aimed to build a talent-driven home for writers, directors and producers.  It helped filmmakers of all experience levels develop their ideas and screenplays into viable feature films, be they fiction, documentary or animation, up until the moment they were ready to get production finance.  There were two funding programmes, one for first-time feature filmmakers and one for established filmmakers.  The First Feature Film Development Programme aimed to identify and support emerging filmmakers (e.g. screenwriters, writer/directors and writer, director, producer teams) who had not made a feature film or who had not yet had a feature film released theatrically or broadcast on UK television.  Awards were made up to \u00a325,000. The fund also offered Signature Awards to help further encourage ambitious and original filmmakers and projects.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFunded films included [[Jane Campion]]'s ''[[Bright Star (film)|Bright Star]]''; Oscar-winning filmmaker [[Andrea Arnold]]'s second feature ''[[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]]''; [[Armando Iannucci]]'s ''[[In the Loop]]''; and [[Sam Taylor Wood]]'s ''[[Nowhere Boy]]'', written by [[Matt Greenhalgh]].\n\nThe '''New Cinema Fund''' supported emerging talent and established filmmakers working outside the mainstream, focusing on innovative writing and gifted directors.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The fund had \u00a315&nbsp;million of Lottery money to invest over three years and funded eight to ten feature films each year.

ABC programs that were preempted or otherwise interrupted by local news events that warrant long-form coverage are usually [[broadcast delay|tape delayed]] to air in overnight timeslots; although station personnel gives viewers the option to watch the affected shows the following day on ABC's desktop and mobile streaming platforms or its cable/satellite [[video-on-demand]] service. As KTUL does not carry a local newscast on weekend mornings, the station airs the live-action [[E/I|educational program]] block ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]'' one hour ahead of the \"live\" feed (airing from 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m., instead of 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&nbsp;p.m.) on Saturdays, and ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on the same hour-ahead format on Sundays.

One of channel 8's most popular program hosts was John Chick, who joined the station (then KTVX) in 1955. From 1955 to 1963, Chick hosted the local afternoon [[children's television series|children's program]] ''Cartoon Zoo'', a showcase of [[animated cartoon|cartoon shorts]] on which he originated the character Mr. Zing, donning a fake moustache \u2013 which Chick had chosen for the purpose of maintaining anonymity when he was not performing the character \u2013 and zookeeper's uniform; the program was the highest-rated children's program in the Tulsa market for most of its run. The program would later evolve into ''Mr. Zing and Tuffy'', after station director Wayne Johnson (who was promoted by KTUL management to serve as its production chief in 1970) conceived the idea for the costumed tiger character Tuffy; he was also joined by another costumed animal character, Shaggy Dog (played by Tom Ledbetter and later, [[Mike Denney]]). After ''Mr. Zing and Tuffy'' was cancelled in 1969 due to a reduction in the station's talent budget, Chick began hosting ''The John Chick Show'', a live morning music program that featured local [[country music]] talent and [[square dancing]]. The weekday morning program proved to be a more popular alternative to network morning shows ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' on KVOO and the ''[[CBS Morning News#Background|CBS Morning News]]'' on KOTV that competed against it in the 7:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; Chick ended his eponymous morning show in January 1979, following his diagnosis of early stage [[multiple sclerosis]] two months prior.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Chick: Ups and downs of live programs|url=http://www.mcalesternews.com/news/local_news/john-chick-ups-and-downs-of-live-programs/article_d0c26e36-3d8f-5ff4-9665-b0429802cb37.html|author=James Beaty|newspaper=[[McAlester News-Capital]]|publisher=[[Community Newspaper Holdings]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GOODBYE TULSA: JOHN CHICK (1932-1986)|url=http://thislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/JOHN-CHICK.pdf|author=Clara Nipper|website=This Land Press|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=KTUL's 'Tuffy' Johnson dies at 66|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/ktul-s-tuffy-johnson-dies-at/article_bd96d28b-e5b9-5e17-8bd1-dcac5cb37447.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 24, 2008|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKTUL replaced ''Mr. Zing and Tuffy'' in 1969 with another children's program, ''Uncle Zeb's Cartoon Camp''. For ten years, Carl Bartholemew hosted the show playing the titular gruff [[senior citizen|senior]] in the similarly formatted cartoon showcase, who was accompanied an array of rural characters including \"Uncle Zip\" (played by Dick Van Dera, who hosted a short-lived spinoff series, ''Uncle Zip's Do-Da-Day''), \"Uncle Zeke\" (played by Al Clauser, who previously served as the puppeteer and voice of B.J. Bluejay on the station's iteration of ''[[Bozo the Clown|The Bozo the Clown Show]]'' in the late 1950s) and \"Cousin Zack\" (played by Kent Doll) and featured various in-studio games in which a select member of the audience of around a dozen local children participated in between the three cartoon shorts. The program \u2013 which ended each episode with the audience members walking across a bridge in the studio to greet family and friends \u2013 was discontinued in 1979, as Bartholomew decided to focus his duties on his existing role as promotions director at channel 8. (Bartholomew would later resurrect the Uncle Zeb character in 1990, when he revived ''Cartoon Camp'' as a local public access program on [[UA-Columbia Cablevision|United Artists Cable]]'s Tulsa system, running for seven additional years through much of the Tulsa system's ownership under TCI.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Happy Trails // Uncle Zeb Hanging Up His Hat After More Than 4,000 Shows|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/happy-trails-uncle-zeb-hanging-up-his-hat-after-more/article_d1a38bcd-fca3-57d4-902c-f0e768e7aa9d.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 2, 1997|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Memorial service today for KTUL's Uncle Zip|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/memorial-service-today-for-ktul-s-uncle-zip/article_4e3d9953-a9b2-535b-8e61-d3d5223ca60a.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 17, 2007|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother popular KTUL personality was [[Betty Boyd (Oklahoma legislator)|Betty Boyd]], a well-known personality at rival KOTV who was lured away to channel 8 in 1965 to host ''The Betty Boyd Show''. The local daytime program featured a mix of interviews with Tulsa area newsmakers, community affairs and women's topics; the program \u2013 which ran until Boyd left channel 8 in 1980 to serve as the director of information for Tulsa Vo-Tech (now [[Tulsa Technology Center]]) \u2013 helped KTUL reach first place among female viewers at a time when ABC had remained lagged in third place among the three national networks in the [[Nielsen ratings]].<ref>{{cite news|title=\"Queen of Tulsa TV\" Betty Boyd dies at 86|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/queen-of-tulsa-tv-betty-boyd-dies-at/article_c9f863d7-1c84-5a60-932d-efdec04ebed7.html|author=Tim Stanley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Preemptions over the years and today===\nHistorically, the station has preempted certain ABC network programs or aired them out of pattern to make room for other local or syndicated programs or, occasionally, because of internal concerns over a program's content. KTUL preempted ''[[Good Morning America]]'' for the first three years of its run from November 1975 to December 1978, in favor of airing ''The John Chick Show'' (''GMA''{{'}}s short-lived predecessor ''[[AM America]]'' was aired on a joined-in-progress basis from January to November 1975, with KTUL choosing to preempt the first hour in favor of ''Chick''). This move led network president [[Elton Rule]] and other ABC executives to visit the station in 1976 to discuss why KTUL did not give clearance to the then-fledgling and fast-growing ABC morning show. Network management backed off its pressure after owner Jimmy Leake informed Rule about ''The John Chick Show''{{'}}s high ratings locally. In the 1970s, KTUL was also one of several ABC affiliates that chose to preempt the network's Sunday morning cartoon rerun block.\n\n''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' also aired mid-mornings on a one-day delay until September 1990, when the station replaced it with the hour-long version of ''[[Home (talk show)|Home]]''; KTUL preempted ABC's half-hour soap operas (''Loving'', ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]'' and finally, ''[[Port Charles]]'') until the network ceded the 12:30&nbsp;p.m. Central Time slot to its affiliates in October 2003. The station also did not carry the network's daytime talk shows: ''Home'' and, throughout their entire respective runs, its successors, ''[[Mike and Maty]]'' and ''[[Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends]]'' were not carried between September 1992 and August 1997, while ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' was preempted from its debut in August 1997 until September 2000, when KTUL began clearing the program in its regular timeslot. The station preempted the Sunday edition of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' until September 2002, in favor of airing infomercials in the half-hour between its local early evening newscast and ABC's Sunday night lineup.\n\nThe station had traditionally aired syndicated programs (airing in a block running anywhere from one hour to 90 minutes) following its 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast for many years, resulting in certain ABC late-night programs that the network recommended its stations air immediately after their [[late local news]]casts being delayed to accommodate them. This practice began in September 1981, when KTUL began to delay ''[[Nightline]]'' to 11:30&nbsp;p.m.\u2014an hour later than most ABC stations had carried it at the time\u2014in order to air syndicated reruns of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' following its late newscast. It never aired the program as recommended at 10:35 for the 32 years that ABC aired the [[News magazine#Television|newsmagazine]] in that timeslot; the hour following the late newscast would eventually be ceded to syndicated sitcom reruns, which have continued to fill that allocated time even after many [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] affiliates in large and mid-sized markets began relegating carriage of off-network content to drama series aired in weekend timeslots.\n\nAs a byproduct of this, channel 8 aired ''[[Politically Incorrect|Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]]'' on a 90-minute delay from its then-recommended 11:05&nbsp;p.m. Central timeslot from its ABC debut in September 1995 until its cancellation in December 2002. The talk show that replaced it, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' (which has preceded ''Nightline'' since the network switched the scheduling order of the two programs in January 2013), was originally preempted by KTUL when it debuted in January 2003, after the station refused to comply with carrying the show in its recommended slot (making it one of a handful of ABC stations that included [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]], [[WFTV]] in [[Orlando]], [[WSOC-TV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[WEAR-TV]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]], not to carry ''Kimmel''). ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' aired instead on WB affiliate KWBT from April 7, 2003 until April 8, 2004, after which KTUL began airing the talk show on a one-hour delay. In September 2014, KTUL pushed both ''Kimmel'' and ''Nightline'' (which had their broadcast order on ABC's late-night schedule switched by the network in January 2013) ahead a half-hour, starting at 11:07&nbsp;p.m., per a request by the network that the station air both programs at earlier times; KTUL would start carrying ''Kimmel'' and ''Nightline'' in their recommended timeslots in January 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=WB to broadcast 'Kimmel Live'|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/wb-to-broadcast-kimmel-live/article_1d96aa53-9fac-5870-8165-333f7f78c245.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 8, 2003|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV Briefs: He's baaaack|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tv-briefs-he-s-baaaack/article_84f09a0b-ff49-5706-8747-2928de781781.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 10, 2004|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kimmel tops Letterman in first night in earlier time slot|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/tv/kimmel-tops-letterman-in-first-night-in-earlier-time-slot/article_b8baa26f-9518-522d-b0c4-be9429307ede.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKTUL ran the entire [[Saturday morning cartoon]] lineup from ABC until July 1992, when it began preempting the lineup in favor of running a two-hour-long Saturday edition of ''Good Morning Oklahoma'' and informational syndicated programs.<ref name=\"world-gmosat\">{{cite news|title=Good Morning, Again // `Saturday Edition' Preempts Cartoons in Favor of -- Gulp! -- News|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/good-morning-again-saturday-edition-preempts-cartoons-in-favor-of/article_01012d31-b818-5979-8961-bcee31ba9727.html|author=John Wooley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=July 17, 1992|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"world-gmosat2\">{{cite news|title=Channel 8 to Drop Saturday Cartoon Schedule|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/channel-to-drop-saturday-cartoon-schedule/article_a45f0ad0-98e2-505e-9b26-86319011b978.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=May 28, 1992|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref> In September 1995, when the station cut back its Saturday morning newscast to an hour-long broadcast at 7&nbsp;a.m., channel 8 resumed carriage of the network's Saturday morning lineup, when it began airing four hours of the Saturday cartoon lineup from 8&nbsp;a.m. to noon; it began clearing the entire lineup again in 1997. From the block's September 2002 rebranding as [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] until September 2006, KTUL began timeshifting the ABC children's programs that were recommended to air during the 10&nbsp;a.m. hour to air on a week-delayed basis at 5&nbsp;a.m., with the remaining four hours airing in pattern from the ABC off-air feed. As other Allbritton-owned ABC stations did with the series, KTUL aired the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' series and\u2014until it was dropped by the network in September 2006\u2014''[[Kim Possible]]'' on the pre-sunrise tape delay due to their lack of educational content; for similar reasons, it preempted ''Power Rangers'' outright from September 2006 until the program was dropped by ABC on August 28, 2010. (Both programs, during their respective runs on the ABC Saturday morning lineup, were cleared by nearby ABC affiliates [[KAKE]] in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[KODE-TV]] in [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]; as both stations provide reasonable coverage within the northern fringes of the Tulsa market, it served as the city's default home for the preempted ABC Kids programs.)\n\nKTUL also declined carriage of ABC's [[NFL Europa|World League of American Football]] game broadcasts during the league's [[1992 WLAF season|1992 season]] (its last before the WLAF's two-year operational suspension), after complaints from some viewers about the games preempting its weekly broadcast of the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church Sunday services in the spring of [[1991 WLAF season|1991]] as well as ABC declining a request by station management to join the games in progress.<ref>{{cite news|title=KTUL passes on WLAF|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/ktul-passes-on-wlaf/article_851b75de-316c-53da-93f7-b21e01c2cdcd.html|author=Barry Lewis|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 3, 1992|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n{{As of|November 2017}}, KTUL presently broadcasts 30 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, one hour on Saturdays and 1\u00bd hours on Sundays). As the station does not produce morning newscasts on Saturdays or Sundays, channel 8 does not produce weather inserts \u2013 live or pre-recorded \u2013 during the weekend editions of ABC's ''Good Morning America'', choosing instead to run the program's placeholder national weather map and ancillary story segments during the time normally allocated by the program for affiliates to air local news and weather inserts.\n\n===News department history===\nChannel 8's news department began operations when the station signed on the air on September 18, 1954, when it debuted a half-hour newscast at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. The program was anchored by Jack Morris, one of the first two personalities at KTVX, alongside meteorologist [[Don Woods (meteorologist)|Don Woods]] (Hal O'Halloran would join the station in 1964 as its [[sports director]]). In addition to his anchoring duties, Morris \u2013 who had worked for KTUL radio since 1940, with the exception of a three-year period in which he served in the [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War II]] \u2013 served as the station's original [[news director]] until he left to become main anchor at KVOO-TV in 1970. During his tenure at channel 8, Morris was one of the first television news anchors in the United States to use the phrase, \"It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your children are?,\" to open a [[late local news]]cast (shortly predating its ascension to iconic status when it was used by [[Tom Gregory]] at [[New York City]] [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WNEW-TV [now Fox owned-and-operated station [[WNYW]]] beginning in 1967). Among Morris' notable assignments during his tenure at channel 8 was a 1956 story involving David Peterson, an infant born with a hole in the wall separating the chambers of his heart, for whom Morris pled for aid to repair the defect. The story led to donations totaling over $1,000, allowing for Peterson to be flown to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] for surgery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former News Anchor Bridged Gap From Radio to TV // Jack Morris to Be Inducted Into Broadcasters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/former-news-anchor-bridged-gap-from-radio-to-tv-jack/article_882ada6f-e3f7-5353-bc5c-4f224880deb2.html|author=Janet Pearson|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=May 22, 1991|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jack Morris 1921-2010: Longtime Tulsa newscaster Jack Morris died at 88|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/obituaries/longtime-tulsa-newscaster-jack-morris-died-at/article_d91627b2-6f34-5345-a8bd-7f0a5b0c3314.html|author=Tim Stanley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=December 7, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=KTVX (TV) Plea Aids Infant|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/56-OCR/1956-06-25-BC-OCR-Page-0100.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=100|date=June 25, 1956|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> Another one of Morris' accomplishments at KTUL was the local television [[documentary film|documentary]] ''The Five Civilized Tribes: Unfinished Journey'', a one-hour documentary that took a look at the histories of Oklahoma's principal [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes \u2013 [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw Nation|Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw]], [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creek]] and [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]] \u2013 in the 19th century as illustrated through paintings, which won the prestigious [[RTNDA Edward R.

Woods \u2013 one of the few professional meteorologists on Tulsa television at the time and the first television weather anchor in Oklahoma to hold a meteorology degree \u2013 was chosen, and his cartoon character became Gusty, a boy caricature based on one which Woods created in 1953 as a meteorologist at KTVH (now Wichita-licensed [[KWCH-DT]]) in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], who was named through a contest held beginning the day of channel 8's sign-on. Throughout his 35-year tenure at the station, Woods drew Gusty live during his weather forecasts in a way that viewers could tell what the expected weather was by what Gusty was doing or wearing: as examples, he could be drawn waving flags and smiling for fair weather, holding an umbrella if rain was forecast or jumping in his \"fraidy hole\" for thunderstorms. Viewers even sent in requests for their own Gusty drawings, with Woods holding on-air drawings selecting a viewer who would win one. After Woods retired from KTUL on March 3, 1989, he continued to work as a watercolor artist and drew Gusty on occasion; Woods even authored a book entitled ''The Gospel According to Gusty'', and one of his Gusty drawings is currently housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which received the drawing in 1970 as a representation of contemporary American art. In April 2005, the [[Oklahoma State Legislature|Oklahoma Legislature]] passed and then-[[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Brad Henry]] signed a state resolution designating Gusty as the state's official cartoon character.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woods to take Gusty and blow|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/woods-to-take-gusty-and-blow/article_d0845ce0-08c1-5a5b-a066-e46611961f60.html|author=Ron Wolfe|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 3, 1989|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Retired meteorologist Don Woods dies at 84|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/obituaries/retired-meteorologist-don-woods-dies-at/article_6f57e918-4b20-5343-aa0a-4c8dbd57e5a7.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 13, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jimmie Tramel: Generations of Oklahomans remember Don Woods and Gusty|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/scene/popculture/jimmie-tramel-generations-of-oklahomans-remember-don-woods-and-gusty/article_6f64be1f-d18c-5cd6-a6d2-efe06895f3d1.html|author=Jimmie Tramel|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 9, 2015|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Don Woods Has Lost His Battle With Cancer|url=http://www.ktul.com/story/18772413/don-woods-has-lost-his-battle-with-cancer|website=KTUL|publisher=[[Allbritton Communications]]|date=June 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619074838/http://www.ktul.com/story/18772413/don-woods-has-lost-his-battle-with-cancer|archivedate=June 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the station's local newscasts became the highest-rated in the Tulsa market, aided by the popularity of main anchor Jack Morris. After Morris left KTUL for KVOO in 1970, KOTV anchor Bob Hower joined channel 8 and took over as main anchor of its evening newscasts. The team of Hower, Woods and sports director [[Chris Lincoln]] (who left KTUL in 1976, and following subsequent stints at [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] and [[ESPN]], returned for additional runs at channel 8 from 2007 to 2011 and again beginning in January 2013) were often known as the \"News Guys\", in reference to a popular series of spots focusing on the main anchor team \u2013 during whose tenure, the station continued its ratings dominance in local news \u2013 that was developed by promotions director Carl Bartholomew. After James Leake sold the station to Allbritton in 1982, KTUL remained #1 in the Tulsa market throughout the 1980s and 1990s with its local newscasts and syndicated programming. This streak as the perennial leader in the Tulsa television market ended in 1999, when KOTV overtook KTUL as the area's most-watched television station.\n\nKTUL launched a community outreach initiative in October 1980 with the debut of the \"Waiting Child\" series of feature segments produced in conjunction with the [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]] (OKDHS), which profile children in OKDHS custody that either have had difficulty being placed in a permanent home (either because of their age or they are a sibling group who wants to be adopted together) or have [[special needs]] that are in need of an adoptive family. The segment \u2013 which started as a weekly feature on the Wednesday edition of channel 8's 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, and currently appears on the 4:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast each Wednesday and on Saturdays during the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast \u2013 was initially conducted by Bob Hower; after Hower's retirement from television broadcasting following his diagnosis of [[spasmodic dysphonia]] in 1986, the segment was hosted by Rea Blakey (1986\u20131988, during her final years as weeknight co-anchor), and later, by John Walls (1986\u20131989, while serving as the station's sports director). Carole Lambert \u2013 who came to 1982 as a weekend evening anchor, before moving to the weeknight broadcasts in 1988, where she spent most of her tenure co-anchoring with Charles Ely \u2013 was the longest serving host of the segment, taking over those duties in June 1990 and reporting for the feature until Lambert retired from KTUL in 2011. Lambert's tenure as segment host saw her be honored, through nomination by now-former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Brad Carson]], with a 2004 \"Angels in Adoption\" award by the [[Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute]]. The ''Waiting Child'' segment \u2013 which features the [[Oleta Adams]] song \"(I'm a) Waiting Child\", which was composed by Hower \u2013 has been credited in the adoption of more than 4,000 Oklahoma children. Since 2011, the segment has been hosted by Keith Taylor (who joined KTUL in 2001 as a news and sports reporter, before becoming weekday morning co-anchor in 2003).<ref>{{cite news|title=`10 Years of Love' // KTUL Looks Back at `Waiting Child'|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/years-of-love-ktul-looks-back-at-waiting-child/article_8a0abf15-9d54-527d-98fe-4e9df2aec756.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=November 11, 1990|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Many TV series crash before take-off|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/many-tv-series-crash-before-take-off/article_e5b4fe61-7e5d-5a6b-a0f8-13918af9d41c.html|author=Ron Wolfe|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 15, 1990|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Television Briefs: Anchor honored for adoption support|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/television-briefs-anchor-honored-for-adoption-support/article_70d845f5-155e-5155-9dab-9fa916617ebf.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=September 23, 2004|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Longtime KTUL news anchor Carole Lambert to leave|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/tv/longtime-ktul-news-anchor-carole-lambert-to-leave/article_2cd2c310-4a3e-527a-a841-528eab8e8d4e.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Longtime news anchor Bob Hower dies|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/longtime-news-anchor-bob-hower-dies/article_9e3769a9-0888-50e5-8cb8-7d70f24e7515.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tulsa TV pioneer Bob Hower remembered|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/tulsa-tv-pioneer-bob-hower-remembered/article_8cb89158-fed7-5cb6-afa1-94daa8ee4ccf.html|author=Tim Stanley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=September 26, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe station's morning newscast, ''Good Morning Oklahoma'' (''GMO''), debuted on June 11, 1990 as a 60-minute broadcast from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;a.m. (The program would expand to 1\u00bd hours in September 1999, then to two hours in September 2003, and finally to 2\u00bd hours, with the September 7, 2010 premiere of 4:30&nbsp;a.m. extension \"Good Morning Oklahoma - Rise & Shine\".)

ABC programs that were preempted or otherwise interrupted by local news events that warrant long-form coverage are usually [[broadcast delay|tape delayed]] to air in overnight timeslots; although station personnel gives viewers the option to watch the affected shows the following day on ABC's desktop and mobile streaming platforms or its cable/satellite [[video-on-demand]] service. As KTUL does not carry a local newscast on weekend mornings, the station airs the live-action [[E/I|educational program]] block ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]'' one hour ahead of the \"live\" feed (airing from 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m., instead of 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&nbsp;p.m.) on Saturdays, and ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on the same hour-ahead format on Sundays.

One of channel 8's most popular program hosts was John Chick, who joined the station (then KTVX) in 1955. From 1955 to 1963, Chick hosted the local afternoon [[children's television series|children's program]] ''Cartoon Zoo'', a showcase of [[animated cartoon|cartoon shorts]] on which he originated the character Mr. Zing, donning a fake moustache \u2013 which Chick had chosen for the purpose of maintaining anonymity when he was not performing the character \u2013 and zookeeper's uniform; the program was the highest-rated children's program in the Tulsa market for most of its run. The program would later evolve into ''Mr. Zing and Tuffy'', after station director Wayne Johnson (who was promoted by KTUL management to serve as its production chief in 1970) conceived the idea for the costumed tiger character Tuffy; he was also joined by another costumed animal character, Shaggy Dog (played by Tom Ledbetter and later, [[Mike Denney]]). After ''Mr. Zing and Tuffy'' was cancelled in 1969 due to a reduction in the station's talent budget, Chick began hosting ''The John Chick Show'', a live morning music program that featured local [[country music]] talent and [[square dancing]]. The weekday morning program proved to be a more popular alternative to network morning shows ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' on KVOO and the ''[[CBS Morning News#Background|CBS Morning News]]'' on KOTV that competed against it in the 7:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; Chick ended his eponymous morning show in January 1979, following his diagnosis of early stage [[multiple sclerosis]] two months prior.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Chick: Ups and downs of live programs|url=http://www.mcalesternews.com/news/local_news/john-chick-ups-and-downs-of-live-programs/article_d0c26e36-3d8f-5ff4-9665-b0429802cb37.html|author=James Beaty|newspaper=[[McAlester News-Capital]]|publisher=[[Community Newspaper Holdings]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GOODBYE TULSA: JOHN CHICK (1932-1986)|url=http://thislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/JOHN-CHICK.pdf|author=Clara Nipper|website=This Land Press|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=KTUL's 'Tuffy' Johnson dies at 66|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/ktul-s-tuffy-johnson-dies-at/article_bd96d28b-e5b9-5e17-8bd1-dcac5cb37447.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 24, 2008|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKTUL replaced ''Mr. Zing and Tuffy'' in 1969 with another children's program, ''Uncle Zeb's Cartoon Camp''. For ten years, Carl Bartholemew hosted the show playing the titular gruff [[senior citizen|senior]] in the similarly formatted cartoon showcase, who was accompanied an array of rural characters including \"Uncle Zip\" (played by Dick Van Dera, who hosted a short-lived spinoff series, ''Uncle Zip's Do-Da-Day''), \"Uncle Zeke\" (played by Al Clauser, who previously served as the puppeteer and voice of B.J. Bluejay on the station's iteration of ''[[Bozo the Clown|The Bozo the Clown Show]]'' in the late 1950s) and \"Cousin Zack\" (played by Kent Doll) and featured various in-studio games in which a select member of the audience of around a dozen local children participated in between the three cartoon shorts. The program \u2013 which ended each episode with the audience members walking across a bridge in the studio to greet family and friends \u2013 was discontinued in 1979, as Bartholomew decided to focus his duties on his existing role as promotions director at channel 8. (Bartholomew would later resurrect the Uncle Zeb character in 1990, when he revived ''Cartoon Camp'' as a local public access program on [[UA-Columbia Cablevision|United Artists Cable]]'s Tulsa system, running for seven additional years through much of the Tulsa system's ownership under TCI.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Happy Trails // Uncle Zeb Hanging Up His Hat After More Than 4,000 Shows|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/happy-trails-uncle-zeb-hanging-up-his-hat-after-more/article_d1a38bcd-fca3-57d4-902c-f0e768e7aa9d.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 2, 1997|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Memorial service today for KTUL's Uncle Zip|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/memorial-service-today-for-ktul-s-uncle-zip/article_4e3d9953-a9b2-535b-8e61-d3d5223ca60a.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 17, 2007|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother popular KTUL personality was [[Betty Boyd (Oklahoma legislator)|Betty Boyd]], a well-known personality at rival KOTV who was lured away to channel 8 in 1965 to host ''The Betty Boyd Show''. The local daytime program featured a mix of interviews with Tulsa area newsmakers, community affairs and women's topics; the program \u2013 which ran until Boyd left channel 8 in 1980 to serve as the director of information for Tulsa Vo-Tech (now [[Tulsa Technology Center]]) \u2013 helped KTUL reach first place among female viewers at a time when ABC had remained lagged in third place among the three national networks in the [[Nielsen ratings]].<ref>{{cite news|title=\"Queen of Tulsa TV\" Betty Boyd dies at 86|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/queen-of-tulsa-tv-betty-boyd-dies-at/article_c9f863d7-1c84-5a60-932d-efdec04ebed7.html|author=Tim Stanley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Preemptions over the years and today===\nHistorically, the station has preempted certain ABC network programs or aired them out of pattern to make room for other local or syndicated programs or, occasionally, because of internal concerns over a program's content. KTUL preempted ''[[Good Morning America]]'' for the first three years of its run from November 1975 to December 1978, in favor of airing ''The John Chick Show'' (''GMA''{{'}}s short-lived predecessor ''[[AM America]]'' was aired on a joined-in-progress basis from January to November 1975, with KTUL choosing to preempt the first hour in favor of ''Chick''). This move led network president [[Elton Rule]] and other ABC executives to visit the station in 1976 to discuss why KTUL did not give clearance to the then-fledgling and fast-growing ABC morning show. Network management backed off its pressure after owner Jimmy Leake informed Rule about ''The John Chick Show''{{'}}s high ratings locally. In the 1970s, KTUL was also one of several ABC affiliates that chose to preempt the network's Sunday morning cartoon rerun block.\n\n''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' also aired mid-mornings on a one-day delay until September 1990, when the station replaced it with the hour-long version of ''[[Home (talk show)|Home]]''; KTUL preempted ABC's half-hour soap operas (''Loving'', ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]'' and finally, ''[[Port Charles]]'') until the network ceded the 12:30&nbsp;p.m. Central Time slot to its affiliates in October 2003. The station also did not carry the network's daytime talk shows: ''Home'' and, throughout their entire respective runs, its successors, ''[[Mike and Maty]]'' and ''[[Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends]]'' were not carried between September 1992 and August 1997, while ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' was preempted from its debut in August 1997 until September 2000, when KTUL began clearing the program in its regular timeslot. The station preempted the Sunday edition of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' until September 2002, in favor of airing infomercials in the half-hour between its local early evening newscast and ABC's Sunday night lineup.\n\nThe station had traditionally aired syndicated programs (airing in a block running anywhere from one hour to 90 minutes) following its 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast for many years, resulting in certain ABC late-night programs that the network recommended its stations air immediately after their [[late local news]]casts being delayed to accommodate them. This practice began in September 1981, when KTUL began to delay ''[[Nightline]]'' to 11:30&nbsp;p.m.\u2014an hour later than most ABC stations had carried it at the time\u2014in order to air syndicated reruns of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' following its late newscast. It never aired the program as recommended at 10:35 for the 32 years that ABC aired the [[News magazine#Television|newsmagazine]] in that timeslot; the hour following the late newscast would eventually be ceded to syndicated sitcom reruns, which have continued to fill that allocated time even after many [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] affiliates in large and mid-sized markets began relegating carriage of off-network content to drama series aired in weekend timeslots.\n\nAs a byproduct of this, channel 8 aired ''[[Politically Incorrect|Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]]'' on a 90-minute delay from its then-recommended 11:05&nbsp;p.m. Central timeslot from its ABC debut in September 1995 until its cancellation in December 2002. The talk show that replaced it, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' (which has preceded ''Nightline'' since the network switched the scheduling order of the two programs in January 2013), was originally preempted by KTUL when it debuted in January 2003, after the station refused to comply with carrying the show in its recommended slot (making it one of a handful of ABC stations that included [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]], [[WFTV]] in [[Orlando]], [[WSOC-TV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[WEAR-TV]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]], not to carry ''Kimmel''). ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' aired instead on WB affiliate KWBT from April 7, 2003 until April 8, 2004, after which KTUL began airing the talk show on a one-hour delay. In September 2014, KTUL pushed both ''Kimmel'' and ''Nightline'' (which had their broadcast order on ABC's late-night schedule switched by the network in January 2013) ahead a half-hour, starting at 11:07&nbsp;p.m., per a request by the network that the station air both programs at earlier times; KTUL would start carrying ''Kimmel'' and ''Nightline'' in their recommended timeslots in January 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=WB to broadcast 'Kimmel Live'|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/wb-to-broadcast-kimmel-live/article_1d96aa53-9fac-5870-8165-333f7f78c245.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 8, 2003|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV Briefs: He's baaaack|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tv-briefs-he-s-baaaack/article_84f09a0b-ff49-5706-8747-2928de781781.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 10, 2004|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kimmel tops Letterman in first night in earlier time slot|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/tv/kimmel-tops-letterman-in-first-night-in-earlier-time-slot/article_b8baa26f-9518-522d-b0c4-be9429307ede.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKTUL ran the entire [[Saturday morning cartoon]] lineup from ABC until July 1992, when it began preempting the lineup in favor of running a two-hour-long Saturday edition of ''Good Morning Oklahoma'' and informational syndicated programs.<ref name=\"world-gmosat\">{{cite news|title=Good Morning, Again // `Saturday Edition' Preempts Cartoons in Favor of -- Gulp! -- News|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/good-morning-again-saturday-edition-preempts-cartoons-in-favor-of/article_01012d31-b818-5979-8961-bcee31ba9727.html|author=John Wooley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=July 17, 1992|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"world-gmosat2\">{{cite news|title=Channel 8 to Drop Saturday Cartoon Schedule|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/channel-to-drop-saturday-cartoon-schedule/article_a45f0ad0-98e2-505e-9b26-86319011b978.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=May 28, 1992|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref> In September 1995, when the station cut back its Saturday morning newscast to an hour-long broadcast at 7&nbsp;a.m., channel 8 resumed carriage of the network's Saturday morning lineup, when it began airing four hours of the Saturday cartoon lineup from 8&nbsp;a.m. to noon; it began clearing the entire lineup again in 1997. From the block's September 2002 rebranding as [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] until September 2006, KTUL began timeshifting the ABC children's programs that were recommended to air during the 10&nbsp;a.m. hour to air on a week-delayed basis at 5&nbsp;a.m., with the remaining four hours airing in pattern from the ABC off-air feed. As other Allbritton-owned ABC stations did with the series, KTUL aired the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' series and\u2014until it was dropped by the network in September 2006\u2014''[[Kim Possible]]'' on the pre-sunrise tape delay due to their lack of educational content; for similar reasons, it preempted ''Power Rangers'' outright from September 2006 until the program was dropped by ABC on August 28, 2010. (Both programs, during their respective runs on the ABC Saturday morning lineup, were cleared by nearby ABC affiliates [[KAKE]] in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[KODE-TV]] in [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]; as both stations provide reasonable coverage within the northern fringes of the Tulsa market, it served as the city's default home for the preempted ABC Kids programs.)\n\nKTUL also declined carriage of ABC's [[NFL Europa|World League of American Football]] game broadcasts during the league's [[1992 WLAF season|1992 season]] (its last before the WLAF's two-year operational suspension), after complaints from some viewers about the games preempting its weekly broadcast of the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church Sunday services in the spring of [[1991 WLAF season|1991]] as well as ABC declining a request by station management to join the games in progress.<ref>{{cite news|title=KTUL passes on WLAF|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/ktul-passes-on-wlaf/article_851b75de-316c-53da-93f7-b21e01c2cdcd.html|author=Barry Lewis|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 3, 1992|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n{{As of|November 2017}}, KTUL presently broadcasts 30 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, one hour on Saturdays and 1\u00bd hours on Sundays). As the station does not produce morning newscasts on Saturdays or Sundays, channel 8 does not produce weather inserts \u2013 live or pre-recorded \u2013 during the weekend editions of ABC's ''Good Morning America'', choosing instead to run the program's placeholder national weather map and ancillary story segments during the time normally allocated by the program for affiliates to air local news and weather inserts.\n\n===News department history===\nChannel 8's news department began operations when the station signed on the air on September 18, 1954, when it debuted a half-hour newscast at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. The program was anchored by Jack Morris, one of the first two personalities at KTVX, alongside meteorologist [[Don Woods (meteorologist)|Don Woods]] (Hal O'Halloran would join the station in 1964 as its [[sports director]]). In addition to his anchoring duties, Morris \u2013 who had worked for KTUL radio since 1940, with the exception of a three-year period in which he served in the [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War II]] \u2013 served as the station's original [[news director]] until he left to become main anchor at KVOO-TV in 1970. During his tenure at channel 8, Morris was one of the first television news anchors in the United States to use the phrase, \"It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your children are?,\" to open a [[late local news]]cast (shortly predating its ascension to iconic status when it was used by [[Tom Gregory]] at [[New York City]] [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WNEW-TV [now Fox owned-and-operated station [[WNYW]]] beginning in 1967). Among Morris' notable assignments during his tenure at channel 8 was a 1956 story involving David Peterson, an infant born with a hole in the wall separating the chambers of his heart, for whom Morris pled for aid to repair the defect. The story led to donations totaling over $1,000, allowing for Peterson to be flown to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] for surgery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former News Anchor Bridged Gap From Radio to TV // Jack Morris to Be Inducted Into Broadcasters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/former-news-anchor-bridged-gap-from-radio-to-tv-jack/article_882ada6f-e3f7-5353-bc5c-4f224880deb2.html|author=Janet Pearson|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=May 22, 1991|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jack Morris 1921-2010: Longtime Tulsa newscaster Jack Morris died at 88|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/obituaries/longtime-tulsa-newscaster-jack-morris-died-at/article_d91627b2-6f34-5345-a8bd-7f0a5b0c3314.html|author=Tim Stanley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=December 7, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=KTVX (TV) Plea Aids Infant|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/56-OCR/1956-06-25-BC-OCR-Page-0100.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=100|date=June 25, 1956|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> Another one of Morris' accomplishments at KTUL was the local television [[documentary film|documentary]] ''The Five Civilized Tribes: Unfinished Journey'', a one-hour documentary that took a look at the histories of Oklahoma's principal [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes \u2013 [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw Nation|Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw]], [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creek]] and [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]] \u2013 in the 19th century as illustrated through paintings, which won the prestigious [[RTNDA Edward R.

Woods \u2013 one of the few professional meteorologists on Tulsa television at the time and the first television weather anchor in Oklahoma to hold a meteorology degree \u2013 was chosen, and his cartoon character became Gusty, a boy caricature based on one which Woods created in 1953 as a meteorologist at KTVH (now Wichita-licensed [[KWCH-DT]]) in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], who was named through a contest held beginning the day of channel 8's sign-on. Throughout his 35-year tenure at the station, Woods drew Gusty live during his weather forecasts in a way that viewers could tell what the expected weather was by what Gusty was doing or wearing: as examples, he could be drawn waving flags and smiling for fair weather, holding an umbrella if rain was forecast or jumping in his \"fraidy hole\" for thunderstorms. Viewers even sent in requests for their own Gusty drawings, with Woods holding on-air drawings selecting a viewer who would win one. After Woods retired from KTUL on March 3, 1989, he continued to work as a watercolor artist and drew Gusty on occasion; Woods even authored a book entitled ''The Gospel According to Gusty'', and one of his Gusty drawings is currently housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which received the drawing in 1970 as a representation of contemporary American art. In April 2005, the [[Oklahoma State Legislature|Oklahoma Legislature]] passed and then-[[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Brad Henry]] signed a state resolution designating Gusty as the state's official cartoon character.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woods to take Gusty and blow|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/woods-to-take-gusty-and-blow/article_d0845ce0-08c1-5a5b-a066-e46611961f60.html|author=Ron Wolfe|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 3, 1989|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Retired meteorologist Don Woods dies at 84|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/obituaries/retired-meteorologist-don-woods-dies-at/article_6f57e918-4b20-5343-aa0a-4c8dbd57e5a7.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 13, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jimmie Tramel: Generations of Oklahomans remember Don Woods and Gusty|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/scene/popculture/jimmie-tramel-generations-of-oklahomans-remember-don-woods-and-gusty/article_6f64be1f-d18c-5cd6-a6d2-efe06895f3d1.html|author=Jimmie Tramel|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 9, 2015|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Don Woods Has Lost His Battle With Cancer|url=http://www.ktul.com/story/18772413/don-woods-has-lost-his-battle-with-cancer|website=KTUL|publisher=[[Allbritton Communications]]|date=June 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619074838/http://www.ktul.com/story/18772413/don-woods-has-lost-his-battle-with-cancer|archivedate=June 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the station's local newscasts became the highest-rated in the Tulsa market, aided by the popularity of main anchor Jack Morris. After Morris left KTUL for KVOO in 1970, KOTV anchor Bob Hower joined channel 8 and took over as main anchor of its evening newscasts. The team of Hower, Woods and sports director [[Chris Lincoln]] (who left KTUL in 1976, and following subsequent stints at [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] and [[ESPN]], returned for additional runs at channel 8 from 2007 to 2011 and again beginning in January 2013) were often known as the \"News Guys\", in reference to a popular series of spots focusing on the main anchor team \u2013 during whose tenure, the station continued its ratings dominance in local news \u2013 that was developed by promotions director Carl Bartholomew. After James Leake sold the station to Allbritton in 1982, KTUL remained #1 in the Tulsa market throughout the 1980s and 1990s with its local newscasts and syndicated programming. This streak as the perennial leader in the Tulsa television market ended in 1999, when KOTV overtook KTUL as the area's most-watched television station.\n\nKTUL launched a community outreach initiative in October 1980 with the debut of the \"Waiting Child\" series of feature segments produced in conjunction with the [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]] (OKDHS), which profile children in OKDHS custody that either have had difficulty being placed in a permanent home (either because of their age or they are a sibling group who wants to be adopted together) or have [[special needs]] that are in need of an adoptive family. The segment \u2013 which started as a weekly feature on the Wednesday edition of channel 8's 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, and currently appears on the 4:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast each Wednesday and on Saturdays during the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast \u2013 was initially conducted by Bob Hower; after Hower's retirement from television broadcasting following his diagnosis of [[spasmodic dysphonia]] in 1986, the segment was hosted by Rea Blakey (1986\u20131988, during her final years as weeknight co-anchor), and later, by John Walls (1986\u20131989, while serving as the station's sports director). Carole Lambert \u2013 who came to 1982 as a weekend evening anchor, before moving to the weeknight broadcasts in 1988, where she spent most of her tenure co-anchoring with Charles Ely \u2013 was the longest serving host of the segment, taking over those duties in June 1990 and reporting for the feature until Lambert retired from KTUL in 2011. Lambert's tenure as segment host saw her be honored, through nomination by now-former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Brad Carson]], with a 2004 \"Angels in Adoption\" award by the [[Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute]]. The ''Waiting Child'' segment \u2013 which features the [[Oleta Adams]] song \"(I'm a) Waiting Child\", which was composed by Hower \u2013 has been credited in the adoption of more than 4,000 Oklahoma children. Since 2011, the segment has been hosted by Keith Taylor (who joined KTUL in 2001 as a news and sports reporter, before becoming weekday morning co-anchor in 2003).<ref>{{cite news|title=`10 Years of Love' // KTUL Looks Back at `Waiting Child'|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/years-of-love-ktul-looks-back-at-waiting-child/article_8a0abf15-9d54-527d-98fe-4e9df2aec756.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=November 11, 1990|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Many TV series crash before take-off|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/many-tv-series-crash-before-take-off/article_e5b4fe61-7e5d-5a6b-a0f8-13918af9d41c.html|author=Ron Wolfe|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 15, 1990|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Television Briefs: Anchor honored for adoption support|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/television-briefs-anchor-honored-for-adoption-support/article_70d845f5-155e-5155-9dab-9fa916617ebf.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=September 23, 2004|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Longtime KTUL news anchor Carole Lambert to leave|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/tv/longtime-ktul-news-anchor-carole-lambert-to-leave/article_2cd2c310-4a3e-527a-a841-528eab8e8d4e.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Longtime news anchor Bob Hower dies|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/longtime-news-anchor-bob-hower-dies/article_9e3769a9-0888-50e5-8cb8-7d70f24e7515.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tulsa TV pioneer Bob Hower remembered|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/tulsa-tv-pioneer-bob-hower-remembered/article_8cb89158-fed7-5cb6-afa1-94daa8ee4ccf.html|author=Tim Stanley|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=September 26, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe station's morning newscast, ''Good Morning Oklahoma'' (''GMO''), debuted on June 11, 1990 as a 60-minute broadcast from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;a.m. (The program would expand to 1\u00bd hours in September 1999, then to two hours in September 2003, and finally to 2\u00bd hours, with the September 7, 2010 premiere of 4:30&nbsp;a.m. extension \"Good Morning Oklahoma - Rise & Shine\".)
