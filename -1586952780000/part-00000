Blue shows printed books. [[Log-lin plot]]; a straight line therefore shows an exponential increase.]]\n=== Background ===\nThe concept of copyright developed after the [[printing press]] came into use in Europe<ref name=histpersp/> in the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref>Joanna Kostylo, \"From Gunpowder to Print: The Common Origins of Copyright and Patent\", in Ronan Deazley et al., ''Privilege and Property: Essays on the History of Copyright'' (Cambridge: Open Book, 2010), 21-50; online at books.openedition.org/obp/1062</ref> The printing press made it much cheaper to produce works, but as there was initially no copyright law, anyone could buy or rent a press and print any text. Popular new works were immediately re-[[Typesetting|set]] and re-published by competitors, so printers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high, and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics.<ref name=reason/> \n\nPrinting brought [[print culture|profound social changes]]. The rise in [[literacy]] across [[Europe]] led to a dramatic increase in the [[demand]] for reading matter.<ref name=histpersp>''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press</ref> Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience.<ref name=reason/> In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany's industrial and economic success.<ref name=reason/>  After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.<ref name=reason>{{cite news |last1=Thadeusz |first1=Frank |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html |work=Spiegel Online |date=18 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=world>{{cite journal |last1=Lasar |first1=Matthew |title=Did Weak Copyright Laws Help Germany Outpace The British Empire? |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/copyright-germany-britain/ |journal=Wired |date=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Conception ===\nThe concept of copyright first developed in [[England]]. In reaction to the printing of \"scandalous books and pamphlets\", the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],<ref name=histpersp/> which required all intended publications to be registered with the government-approved [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], giving the Stationers the right to regulate what material could be printed.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/677787 |title=''Cum privilegio'': Licensing of the Press Act of 1662 |journal=The Library Quarterly |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=494\u2013500 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/17219056/1/677787.pdf |year=2014 |last1=Nipps |first1=Karen }}</ref>\n\nThe Statute of Anne, enacted in 1710 in England and Scotland provided the first legislation to protect copyrights (but not authors' rights). The Copyright Act of 1814 extended more rights for authors but did not protect British from reprinting in the US. The Berne International Copyright Convention of 1886 finally provided protection for authors among the countries who signed the agreement, although the US did not join the Berne Convention until 1989.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Day O'Connor|first=Sandra|date=2002|title=Copyright Law from an American Perspective|journal=Irish Jurist|volume=37|pages=16\u201322|jstor=44027015}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Constitution grants Congress the right to establish copyright and patent laws. Shortly after the Constitution was passed, Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1790, modeling it after the Statute of Anne. While the national law protected authors\u2019 published works, authority was granted to the states to protect authors\u2019 unpublished works. The most recent major overhaul of copyright in the US, the 1976 Copyright Act, extended federal copyright to works as soon as they are created and \"fixed\", without requiring publication or registration. State law continues to apply to unpublished works that are not otherwise copyrighted by federal law.<ref name=\":2\" /> This act also changed the calculation of copyright term from a fixed term (then a maximum of fifty-six years) to \"life of the author plus 50 years\". These changes brought the US closer to conformity with the Berne Convention, and in 1989 the United States further revised its copyright law and joined the Berne Convention officially.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCopyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&nbsp;se.<ref>Bettig, Ronald V. (1996).

An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.\n\nThe [[Copyright Clause]] of the United States, Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.\n\nThe original length of copyright in the United States was 14&nbsp;years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14\u2011year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the [[public domain]], so it could be used and built upon by others.\n\nCopyright law was enacted rather [[Copyright in Germany|late in German states]], and the historian Eckhard H\u00f6ffner argues that the absence of copyright laws in the early 19th century encouraged publishing, was profitable for authors, led to a proliferation of books, enhanced knowledge, and was ultimately an important factor in the ascendency of Germany as a power during that century.<ref name=\"thad\">{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html |author=Frank Thadeusz |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=18 August 2010 |access-date=11 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n=== International copyright treaties ===\n{{See also |International copyright agreements |List of parties to international copyright agreements }}\n[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler - The Pirate Publisher - Puck Magazine - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|'' The Pirate Publisher\u2014An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1886, satirizes the then-existing situation where a publisher could profit by simply stealing newly published works from one country, and publishing them in another, and vice versa.]]\nThe 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] first established recognition of copyrights among [[Sovereignty|sovereign nations]], rather than merely bilaterally.

The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100&nbsp;years later with the passage of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. Specially, for educational and scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing countries.

However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.\n\nCopyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an [[Original work|original creation]], rather than based on [[Plagiarism checker|whether it is unique]]; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.\n\n=== Registration ===\n{{Main |Copyright registration }}\nIn all countries where the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.<ref name=\"Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5\" /> However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright |url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf |website=copyright.gov |access-date=4 June 2015 }}</ref> (In the US, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)\n\nA widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the [[poor man's copyright]].

Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: \"It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.\" Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression\" to obtain copyright protection.<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\">See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law''].

In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The People's Platform:Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age. |last=Taylor |first=Astra |publisher=Picador |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-250-06259-8 |location=New York City, New York, USA |pages=144\u2013145 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 the United States enacted the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act, amending the 1976&nbsp;Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention.

While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])\n\nIn most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.\n\n\"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Astra |title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age |date=2014 |publisher=Picador |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-250-06259-8 |page=148 }}</ref>\n\n=== Copyright infringement ===\n{{Main|Copyright infringement}}\nFor a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

Economic rights allow right owners to derive financial reward from the use of their works by others. Moral rights allow authors and creators to take certain actions to preserve and protect their link with their work. The author or creator may be the owner of the economic rights or those rights may be transferred to one or more copyright owners. Many countries do not allow the transfer of moral rights. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf |title=World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). |date=20 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic rights ===\nWith any kind of property, its owner may decide how it is to be used, and others can use it lawfully only if they have the owner's permission, often through a license. The owner's use of the property must, however, respect the legally recognised rights and interests of other members of society. So the owner of a copyright-protected work may decide how to use the work, and may prevent others from using it without permission. National laws usually grant copyright owners exclusive rights to allow third parties to use their works, subject to the legally recognised rights and interests of others.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most copyright laws state that authors or other right owners have the right to authorise or prevent certain acts in relation to a work. Right owners can authorise or prohibit:\n\n* reproduction of the work in various forms, such as printed publications or sound recordings;\n* distribution of copies of the work;\n* public performance of the work;\n* broadcasting or other communication of the work to the public;\n* translation of the work into other languages; and\n* adaptation of the work, such as turning a novel into a screenplay.\n\n=== Moral rights ===\nMoral rights are concerned with the non-economic rights of a creator. They protect the creator's connection with a work as well as the integrity of the work. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. In some EU countries, such as France, moral rights last indefinitely. In the UK, however, moral rights are finite. That is, the right of attribution and the right of integrity last only as long as the work is in copyright. When the copyright term comes to an end, so too do the moral rights in that work. This is just one reason why the moral rights regime within the UK is often regarded as weaker or inferior to the protection of moral rights in continental Europe and elsewhere in the world.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyrightuser.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CU_CaseFile_11.pdf |title=THE MUTILATED WORK |website=Copyright User }}</ref> The Berne Convention, in Article 6bis, requires its members to grant authors the following rights:\n\n# the right to claim authorship of a work (sometimes called the right of paternity or the right of attribution); and\n# the right to object to any distortion or modification of a work, or other derogatory action in relation to a work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation (sometimes called the right of integrity).\n\nThese and other similar rights granted in national laws are generally known as the moral rights of authors. The Berne Convention requires these rights to be independent of authors\u2019 economic rights. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. This means that even where, for example, a film producer or publisher owns the economic rights in a work, in many jurisdictions the individual author continues to have moral rights.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recently, as a part of the debates being held at the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] on the question of inclusion of Moral Rights as a part of the framework of the [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in United States]], the Copyright Office concluded that many diverse aspects of the current moral rights patchwork\u2014including copyright law's derivative work right, state moral rights statutes, and contract law\u2014are generally working well and should not be changed. Further, the Office concludes that there is no need for the creation of a blanket moral rights statute at this time. However, there are aspects of the U.S. moral rights patchwork that could be improved to the benefit of individual authors and the copyright system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/policy/moralrights/full-report.pdf |title=authors, attribution, and integrity: examining moral rights in the united states |date=April 2019 |website=U.S. Copyright Office }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in the United States]], several exclusive rights are granted to the holder of a copyright, as are listed below:\n\n* protection of the work\n* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.\n* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)\n* to import or export the work\n* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)\n* to perform or display the work publicly\n* to sell or cede these rights to others\n* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group }}</ref>\n\nThe basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase \"exclusive right\" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a \"negative right\", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].<ref>Tom G. Palmer, [http://www.tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/morallyjustified.pdf \"Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified?\"] Accessed 5 February 2013.</ref>\n\n[[UK copyright law]] gives creators both economic rights and moral rights.

In the UK, moral rights include the right to be identified as the author of the work, which is generally identified as the right of attribution, and the right not to have your work subjected to \u2018derogatory treatment\u2019, that is the right of integrity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Copyright law of India|Indian copyright law]] is at parity with the international standards as contained in [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]].

India is also a party to the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Rights of Producers of Phonograms and is an active member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).

The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode |17 |305 }}</ref> and the United Kingdom<ref>The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</ref>), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.\n\nThe length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C |via=Google Books }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.<ref>\"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].\", ''[[Cornell University]]''.</ref> In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.<ref>See Peter B. Hirtle, \"Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015\" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}</ref> Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.\n\nBut if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.\n\nIn 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.<ref>Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)</ref>\n\n== Limitations and exceptions ==\n{{Main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright }}\n\nIn many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. United States copyright law does not cover names, titles, short phrases or listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).<ref>[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]</ref> However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover, such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.\n\n=== Idea\u2013expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine ===\n{{Main|Idea\u2013expression divide }}\n\nThe idea\u2013expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;102(b).\n\n=== The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights ===\n\n{{Main|First-sale doctrine |Exhaustion of rights }}\nCopyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.\n\nSome countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.\n\nIn ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=John Wiley & Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017  }}</ref> in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6\u20133 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.\n\nIn addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.\n\n=== Fair use and fair dealing ===\n{{Main|Fair use |Fair dealing }}\nCopyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[fair use]] doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:\n# the purpose and character of one's use\n# the nature of the copyrighted work\n# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and\n# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |access-date=16 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to \"format shift\" that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to \"time shift\" a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.\n\nIn the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.\n\n:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''\n\n:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''\n\nLater acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.<ref name=\"Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights\" /> An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.\n\n[[Copyright law of the European Union|EU copyright laws]] recognise the right of EU member states to implement some national exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:\n*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,\n*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial\n*archival reproductions of broadcasts,\n*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,\n*for demonstration or repair of equipment,\n*for non-commercial research or private study\n*when used in [[parody]]\n\n=== Accessible copies ===\nIt is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired people without permission from the copyright holder.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121 |title=Chapter 1 \u2013 Circular 92 \u2013 U.S. Copyright Office |website=www.copyright.gov }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp |title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=11 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor |Transfer and licensing, and assignment }} Transfer, assignment and licensing ==\n{{See also|Collective rights management |Extended collective licensing |Compulsory license |Copyright transfer agreement }}\n[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]\nA copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization |page=15 }}</ref> For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations.

In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and their work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.\n\nA transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.\n\nCopyright may also be [[license]]d.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\" /> Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.\n\n=== Free licenses ===\nCopyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].\n\nFounded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization<ref name=\"CC\">{{Cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website |website=creativecommons.org |access-date=24 October 2011 }}</ref> which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nTerms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.<ref name=\"Rubin\">Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341</ref> {{As of |2009 }} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.<ref name=\"Rubin\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main |Criticism of copyright }}\nSome sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].\n\nConcerns are often couched in the language of [[digital rights]], digital freedom, [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship |publisher=European Digital Rights |access-date=24 June 2018 |date=20 June 2018 }}</ref> Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, and as a result [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]] have been created. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].\n\n== Public domain ==\n{{Main |Public domain }}\nCopyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Law }}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adelphi Charter]]\n* [[Artificial scarcity]]\n* [[Authors' rights]] and [[related rights]], roughly equivalent concepts in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries\n* [[Conflict of l\u0646\u062f\u0644\u06a9\u067e\u062faws]]\n* [[Copyleft]]\n* [[Copyright Alliance]]\n* [[Copyright in architecture in the United States]]\n* [[Copyright on the content of patents and in the context of patent prosecution]]\n* [[Copyright for Creativity]]\n* [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]] (European Union)\n* [[Copyright infringement]]\n* [[Copyright on religious works]]\n* [[Copyright Remedy Clarification Act]] (CRCA)\n* [[Creative Barcode]]\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* [[Digital watermarking]]\n* [[Entertainment law]]\n* [[Freedom of panorama]]\n* [[Information literacies]]\n* [[Intellectual property protection of typefaces]]\n* [[List of Copyright Acts]]\n* [[List of copyright case law]]\n* [[Literary property]]\n* [[Model release]]\n* [[Criticism of copyright]]\n* [[Paracopyright]]\n* [[Photography and the law]]\n* [[Pirate Party]]\n* [[Printing patent]], a precursor to copyright\n* [[Private copying levy]]\n* [[Production music]]\n* [[Rent-seeking]]\n* [[Reproduction fees]]\n* [[Samizdat]]\n* [[Software copyright]]\n* [[Threshold pledge system]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |author=Dowd, Raymond J.\n  |title=Copyright Litigation Handbook\n  |publisher=Thomson West |edition=1st |year=2006\n  |isbn=0-314-96279-4\n  |ref=Dowd, Litigation handbook\n}}\n* Ellis, Sara R.

Popular new works were immediately re-[[Typesetting|set]] and re-published by competitors, so printers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high, and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics.<ref name=reason/> \n\nPrinting brought [[print culture|profound social changes]]. The rise in [[literacy]] across [[Europe]] led to a dramatic increase in the [[demand]] for reading matter.<ref name=histpersp>''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ.

In reaction to the printing of \"scandalous books and pamphlets\", the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],<ref name=histpersp/> which required all intended publications to be registered with the government-approved [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], giving the Stationers the right to regulate what material could be printed.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/677787 |title=''Cum privilegio'': Licensing of the Press Act of 1662 |journal=The Library Quarterly |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=494\u2013500 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/17219056/1/677787.pdf |year=2014 |last1=Nipps |first1=Karen }}</ref>\n\nThe Statute of Anne, enacted in 1710 in England and Scotland provided the first legislation to protect copyrights (but not authors' rights). The Copyright Act of 1814 extended more rights for authors but did not protect British from reprinting in the US. The Berne International Copyright Convention of 1886 finally provided protection for authors among the countries who signed the agreement, although the US did not join the Berne Convention until 1989.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Day O'Connor|first=Sandra|date=2002|title=Copyright Law from an American Perspective|journal=Irish Jurist|volume=37|pages=16\u201322|jstor=44027015}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Constitution grants Congress the right to establish copyright and patent laws. Shortly after the Constitution was passed, Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1790, modeling it after the Statute of Anne. While the national law protected authors\u2019 published works, authority was granted to the states to protect authors\u2019 unpublished works. The most recent major overhaul of copyright in the US, the 1976 Copyright Act, extended federal copyright to works as soon as they are created and \"fixed\", without requiring publication or registration. State law continues to apply to unpublished works that are not otherwise copyrighted by federal law.<ref name=\":2\" /> This act also changed the calculation of copyright term from a fixed term (then a maximum of fifty-six years) to \"life of the author plus 50 years\". These changes brought the US closer to conformity with the Berne Convention, and in 1989 the United States further revised its copyright law and joined the Berne Convention officially.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCopyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&nbsp;se.<ref>Bettig, Ronald V. (1996).

An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.\n\nThe [[Copyright Clause]] of the United States, Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.\n\nThe original length of copyright in the United States was 14&nbsp;years, and it had to be explicitly applied for.

However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.\n\nCopyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an [[Original work|original creation]], rather than based on [[Plagiarism checker|whether it is unique]]; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.\n\n=== Registration ===\n{{Main |Copyright registration }}\nIn all countries where the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.<ref name=\"Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5\" /> However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright |url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf |website=copyright.gov |access-date=4 June 2015 }}</ref> (In the US, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)\n\nA widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the [[poor man's copyright]].

Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: \"It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.\" Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression\" to obtain copyright protection.<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\">See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law''].

In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete.

While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])\n\nIn most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.\n\n\"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Astra |title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age |date=2014 |publisher=Picador |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-250-06259-8 |page=148 }}</ref>\n\n=== Copyright infringement ===\n{{Main|Copyright infringement}}\nFor a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

Economic rights allow right owners to derive financial reward from the use of their works by others. Moral rights allow authors and creators to take certain actions to preserve and protect their link with their work. The author or creator may be the owner of the economic rights or those rights may be transferred to one or more copyright owners. Many countries do not allow the transfer of moral rights. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf |title=World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). |date=20 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic rights ===\nWith any kind of property, its owner may decide how it is to be used, and others can use it lawfully only if they have the owner's permission, often through a license. The owner's use of the property must, however, respect the legally recognised rights and interests of other members of society. So the owner of a copyright-protected work may decide how to use the work, and may prevent others from using it without permission. National laws usually grant copyright owners exclusive rights to allow third parties to use their works, subject to the legally recognised rights and interests of others.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most copyright laws state that authors or other right owners have the right to authorise or prevent certain acts in relation to a work. Right owners can authorise or prohibit:\n\n* reproduction of the work in various forms, such as printed publications or sound recordings;\n* distribution of copies of the work;\n* public performance of the work;\n* broadcasting or other communication of the work to the public;\n* translation of the work into other languages; and\n* adaptation of the work, such as turning a novel into a screenplay.\n\n=== Moral rights ===\nMoral rights are concerned with the non-economic rights of a creator. They protect the creator's connection with a work as well as the integrity of the work. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. In some EU countries, such as France, moral rights last indefinitely. In the UK, however, moral rights are finite. That is, the right of attribution and the right of integrity last only as long as the work is in copyright. When the copyright term comes to an end, so too do the moral rights in that work. This is just one reason why the moral rights regime within the UK is often regarded as weaker or inferior to the protection of moral rights in continental Europe and elsewhere in the world.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyrightuser.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CU_CaseFile_11.pdf |title=THE MUTILATED WORK |website=Copyright User }}</ref> The Berne Convention, in Article 6bis, requires its members to grant authors the following rights:\n\n# the right to claim authorship of a work (sometimes called the right of paternity or the right of attribution); and\n# the right to object to any distortion or modification of a work, or other derogatory action in relation to a work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation (sometimes called the right of integrity).\n\nThese and other similar rights granted in national laws are generally known as the moral rights of authors. The Berne Convention requires these rights to be independent of authors\u2019 economic rights. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. This means that even where, for example, a film producer or publisher owns the economic rights in a work, in many jurisdictions the individual author continues to have moral rights.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recently, as a part of the debates being held at the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] on the question of inclusion of Moral Rights as a part of the framework of the [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in United States]], the Copyright Office concluded that many diverse aspects of the current moral rights patchwork\u2014including copyright law's derivative work right, state moral rights statutes, and contract law\u2014are generally working well and should not be changed. Further, the Office concludes that there is no need for the creation of a blanket moral rights statute at this time. However, there are aspects of the U.S. moral rights patchwork that could be improved to the benefit of individual authors and the copyright system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/policy/moralrights/full-report.pdf |title=authors, attribution, and integrity: examining moral rights in the united states |date=April 2019 |website=U.S. Copyright Office }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in the United States]], several exclusive rights are granted to the holder of a copyright, as are listed below:\n\n* protection of the work\n* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.\n* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)\n* to import or export the work\n* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)\n* to perform or display the work publicly\n* to sell or cede these rights to others\n* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group }}</ref>\n\nThe basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase \"exclusive right\" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a \"negative right\", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].<ref>Tom G.

In the UK, moral rights include the right to be identified as the author of the work, which is generally identified as the right of attribution, and the right not to have your work subjected to \u2018derogatory treatment\u2019, that is the right of integrity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Copyright law of India|Indian copyright law]] is at parity with the international standards as contained in [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]].

The Indian system provides both the economic and moral rights under different provisions of its Indian Copyright Act of 1957.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/655852/Copyright/Copyright+Law+In+India+Everything+You+Must+Know|title=Copyright Law In India|last=Dalmia|first=Vijay Pal|date=14 December 2017|website=Mondaq}}</ref>\n\n===Duration===<!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] -->\n{{Main|Copyright term |List of countries' copyright length }}\n[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (currently based on the date of creation or publication).]]\nCopyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode |17 |305 }}</ref> and the United Kingdom<ref>The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</ref>), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.\n\nThe length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C |via=Google Books }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.<ref>\"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].\", ''[[Cornell University]]''.</ref> In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.<ref>See Peter B. Hirtle, \"Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015\" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}</ref> Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.\n\nBut if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.\n\nIn 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.<ref>Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)</ref>\n\n== Limitations and exceptions ==\n{{Main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright }}\n\nIn many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. United States copyright law does not cover names, titles, short phrases or listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).<ref>[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]</ref> However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover, such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.\n\n=== Idea\u2013expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine ===\n{{Main|Idea\u2013expression divide }}\n\nThe idea\u2013expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;102(b).\n\n=== The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights ===\n\n{{Main|First-sale doctrine |Exhaustion of rights }}\nCopyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.\n\nSome countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.\n\nIn ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=John Wiley & Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017  }}</ref> in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6\u20133 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.\n\nIn addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.\n\n=== Fair use and fair dealing ===\n{{Main|Fair use |Fair dealing }}\nCopyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[fair use]] doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:\n# the purpose and character of one's use\n# the nature of the copyrighted work\n# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and\n# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |access-date=16 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to \"format shift\" that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to \"time shift\" a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.\n\nIn the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.\n\n:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''\n\n:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''\n\nLater acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.<ref name=\"Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights\" /> An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.\n\n[[Copyright law of the European Union|EU copyright laws]] recognise the right of EU member states to implement some national exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:\n*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,\n*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial\n*archival reproductions of broadcasts,\n*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,\n*for demonstration or repair of equipment,\n*for non-commercial research or private study\n*when used in [[parody]]\n\n=== Accessible copies ===\nIt is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired people without permission from the copyright holder.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121 |title=Chapter 1 \u2013 Circular 92 \u2013 U.S. Copyright Office |website=www.copyright.gov }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp |title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=11 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor |Transfer and licensing, and assignment }} Transfer, assignment and licensing ==\n{{See also|Collective rights management |Extended collective licensing |Compulsory license |Copyright transfer agreement }}\n[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]\nA copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization |page=15 }}</ref> For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and their work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.\n\nA transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.\n\nCopyright may also be [[license]]d.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\" /> Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.\n\n=== Free licenses ===\nCopyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].\n\nFounded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization<ref name=\"CC\">{{Cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website |website=creativecommons.org |access-date=24 October 2011 }}</ref> which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nTerms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.<ref name=\"Rubin\">Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341</ref> {{As of |2009 }} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.<ref name=\"Rubin\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main |Criticism of copyright }}\nSome sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].\n\nConcerns are often couched in the language of [[digital rights]], digital freedom, [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship |publisher=European Digital Rights |access-date=24 June 2018 |date=20 June 2018 }}</ref> Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, and as a result [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]] have been created. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].\n\n== Public domain ==\n{{Main |Public domain }}\nCopyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Law }}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adelphi Charter]]\n* [[Artificial scarcity]]\n* [[Authors' rights]] and [[related rights]], roughly equivalent concepts in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries\n* [[Conflict of laws]]\n* [[Copyleft]]\n* [[Copyright Alliance]]\n* [[Copyright in architecture in the United States]]\n* [[Copyright on the content of patents and in the context of patent prosecution]]\n* [[Copyright for Creativity]]\n* [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]] (European Union)\n* [[Copyright infringement]]\n* [[Copyright on religious works]]\n* [[Copyright Remedy Clarification Act]] (CRCA)\n* [[Creative Barcode]]\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* [[Digital watermarking]]\n* [[Entertainment law]]\n* [[Freedom of panorama]]\n* [[Information literacies]]\n* [[Intellectual property protection of typefaces]]\n* [[List of Copyright Acts]]\n* [[List of copyright case law]]\n* [[Literary property]]\n* [[Model release]]\n* [[Criticism of copyright]]\n* [[Paracopyright]]\n* [[Photography and the law]]\n* [[Pirate Party]]\n* [[Printing patent]], a precursor to copyright\n* [[Private copying levy]]\n* [[Production music]]\n* [[Rent-seeking]]\n* [[Reproduction fees]]\n* [[Samizdat]]\n* [[Software copyright]]\n* [[Threshold pledge system]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |author=Dowd, Raymond J.\n  |title=Copyright Litigation Handbook\n  |publisher=Thomson West |edition=1st |year=2006\n  |isbn=0-314-96279-4\n  |ref=Dowd, Litigation handbook\n}}\n* Ellis, Sara R.
