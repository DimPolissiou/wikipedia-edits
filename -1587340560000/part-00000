''Pieris rapae'' is widespread in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]; it is believed to have originated in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] region of Europe, and to have spread across Eurasia thanks to the diversification of brassicaceous crops and the development of human trade routes.

Although the [[larva]]l instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During the first and second instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow but the rest of the head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed.<ref name=\"Richards 1940\" /> In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated [[cabbage]]s, [[kale]], [[radish]], [[broccoli]], and [[horseradish]].

Once it hatches from the egg, it eats its own eggshell and then moves to eat the leaves of the host plant. It bores into the interior of the cabbage, [[list of feeding behaviours|feeding]] on the new sprouts. The mustard oil from the host plant makes the larva distasteful to birds. The larvae adjust their feeding rate to maintain a constant rate of nitrogen uptake. They will feed faster in low nitrogen environment and utilize the nitrogen more efficiently (at the cost of efficiency in other nutrients) than larvae hatched on nitrogen high host plant. However, no significant difference in [[Economic growth|growth]] rate was observed between larvae in the two environments.<ref name=\"Scott 1986\" /> \nConsidered a serious pest, the caterpillar is known to be responsible for annual damage worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.<ref name=\"Holland 1931\" />\n\nThe larvae are shown to disperse their damage on the plant.<ref name=\"1990 Maurico and Bower\">{{cite journal|last=Maurico|first=Rodney|author2=M.

They move around the plant mostly spending their time feeding. A feeding bout is immediately followed by a change in position, either to a new leaf or to another part of the same leaf.<ref name=\"1990 Maurico and Bower\" /> This dispersal of damage is seen as an adaptive behavior to hide the visual cues from predators that rely on vision. Even though ''P. rapae'' larvae are cryptic, they remain in the sun for the majority of the day, rather than hiding on the underside of the leaf. The condition of the host plant influences the larval growth significantly.\n\nLarval duration, pupal weights, adult weights, and larval growth rates were significantly altered by both plant nutrient availability and plant species. Larvae preferred Brassicaceae plants over other host plants.

An adult butterfly shows a flower constancy in foraging, visiting flower species that it has already experienced. The ability to find nectar from the flower increased over time, showing a certain learning curve. Furthermore, the ability to find nectar from the first flower species decreased if the adult butterfly started to feed nectar from other plant species.<ref name=\"Lewis 1986\">{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Alcinda C.|title=Memory Constraints and Flower Choice in Pieris rapae|journal=Science|date=16 May 1986|volume=232|pages=863\u2013865|doi=10.1126/science.232.4752.863|pmid=17755969|issue=4752|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e922b3b68e4be76ebb94c01eea90e972852f67d1}}</ref>\n\n===Courtship and reproduction===\n[[File:Pieris rapae which copulates 0928.jpg|thumb|right|Copulating pair]]\nThe male, when it spots a female, zigzags up, down, below, and in front of her, flying until she lands.

Younger plants often had yellow/green color while older plants display a darker and stronger green. Female butterflies preferred the older plants due to the attraction to the darker green color. However, larvae perform better on younger plants.\n\n==== Behavior on plant ====\nOnce a gravid female lands on a plant, tactile and contact chemical stimuli are major factors affecting acceptance or rejection of the site for egg deposition. Once a female lands on a host plant, it will go through a \"drumming reaction\" or a rapid movement of the forelegs across the surface of a leaf.

''[[Cotesia rubecula]]'' and ''[[Cotesia glomerata]]'', previously in the genus ''[[Apanteles]]'', were introduced in North America from Asia as [[biocontrol]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''C. rubecula'' lays its eggs in the 1st and 2nd instar caterpillars.
