The antagonist in \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]\" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals, like those of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Roald Dahl]], some giants are both intelligent and friendly.\n\n== Literary and cultural analysis ==\nGiants appear in the folklore of many cultures, as they represent a relatively simple concept.<ref name=\"Weinstock2016\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6H7eCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT494|title=The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters|author=Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04425-3|page=494}}</ref> They are common in Western culture's folklore, as well as [[Near Eastern]] folklore such as that of the [[Jews]].<ref name=\"Weinstock2016\" />\n\nRepresenting human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous, giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body's frailty and mortality.

This character also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman, similar to a female version of the Greek [[Heracles]]). \"[[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]]\" is the name of a modern town on the spot.\n\n=== Basque  ===\nGiants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of [[San Martin Txiki]], while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures ([[dolmen]]s, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.\n\nHowever, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as [[jentilak]] and [[mairuak]], while as individuals they can be represented as [[Basajaun]] (\"the lord of the forests\"), Sanson (development of the biblical [[Samson]]), Errolan (based on the [[Franks|Frankish]] army general [[Roland]] who fell dead at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]) or even [[Tartalo]] (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]).\n\n=== Bulgarian ===\n{{Main|Ispolin (Bulgarian mythology)}}\nIn [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] mythology, giants called [[Ispolin (Bulgarian mythology)|ispolini]] inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons.

They were involved in a conflict with the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] called the ''[[Gigantomachy]]'' (\u0393\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) when Gaia had them attack [[Mount Olympus]]. This battle was eventually settled when the hero [[Heracles]] decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]], to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s.\n\n[[Herodotus]] in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in [[Tegea]] the body of [[Orestes]], which was seven cubits long\u2014around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book ''The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus'' [[Plutarch]] describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of [[Theseus]], which was ''of more than ordinary size''. The kneecaps of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.\n\nThe [[Cyclopes]], are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa, and nemesis of Odysseus, comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.\n\nThe [[Hecatoncheires]] are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.\n\nOther known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed [[Gegenees|Gegeines]], the northern [[Hyperborea]]ns, and the cannibalistic [[Laestrygonians]].\n\n=== Hindu ===\n{{Refimprove section||date=November 2015}}\nIn [[Hinduism]], the giants are called [[Daitya]]s. The Daityas (\u0926\u0948\u0924\u094d\u092f) were the children of [[Diti]] and the sage [[Kashyapa]] who fought against the gods or [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race, they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely [[Danavas]] and [[Asuras]]. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called [[Rakshasas]], the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include [[Hiranyakashipu]] and [[Hiranyaksha]]. The main antagonist of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], [[Ravana]], was a [[Brahmin]] from his father's side and a Daitya from his mother's side. His younger brother [[Kumbhakarna]] was said to be as tall as a mountain and was quite good natured.\n\n=== Jain ===\nAccording to [[Jain]]s, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=226}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/topic/Tirthankara|title=Tirthankara|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> [[Jain cosmology]] divides worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, ''avasarpani'' (age of descending purity) and ascending (''utsarpani'').{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=175}}\n[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Division of time as envisaged by Jains.

University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology (University of California at Berkeley) 25 (1): 1\u2013183.</ref> Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.<ref name=\"Greene2005\">{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Michael S|title=Nevada: A Journey of Discovery|year=2005|page=39|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Utah|isbn=1-58685-139-X}}</ref>\n\n[[Adrienne Mayor]] writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book, ''Legends of the First Americans''.<ref name=\"Mayor2005\">{{cite book|last=Mayor|first=Adrienne|title=Fossil legends of the first Americans|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-11345-9}}</ref> She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.\n\n[[Aztec ]] features the [[Quinametzin]], a race of giant men created in one of the previous [[Five Suns|solar eras]]. They are credited for the construction of [[Teotihuacan]].\n\n=== Norse ===\n{{main| J\u00f6tunn}}\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the Jotun (''[[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]]'' in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], a cognate with ''[[wikt:ettin|ettin]]'') are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (''hr\u00edm\u00feursar''), fire giants (''eldj\u00f6tnar''), and mountain giants (''bergrisar'').\n\nThe giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the [[Fenrisulfr]]), and in the eventual battle of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] the giants will storm [[Asgard]] and fight them, until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages, and there are giants such as [[\u00c6gir]], [[Loki]], [[M\u00edmir]], and [[Ska\u00f0i]], who bear little difference in status to them. The Chief God [[Odin]] was the great-grand son of the Giant [[Ymir]].\n\nNorse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions, which name is considered by some to share a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] with the name [[Yama]] of Indo-Iranian mythology.\n\nAn old [[Iceland]]ic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near [[Drangey]] Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"Old Hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.\n\nA ''bergrisi'' \u2013 the traditional Protector of Southwestern Iceland \u2013 appears as a [[supporter]] on the [[coat of arms of Iceland]].\n\n=== Roman  ===\n[[File:Herakles Antaios Louvre G103.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hercules]] faces the giant [[Antaios]] in this illustration on a calix [[krater]], c. 515\u2013510 BC.]]\nSeveral [[Jupiter Column|Jupiter-Giant-Columns]] have been found in [[Germania Superior]]. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a Giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura and Alsace.\n\n=== Other European  ===\n[[File:Walter Crane King Arthur and the Giant Book I, Canto VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[King Arthur]] faces a giant in this engraving by [[Walter Crane]].]]\nIn [[folklore]] from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations.  [[Saxo Grammaticus]], for example, argues that giants had to exist, because nothing else would explain the large walls, stone monuments, and statues that we now know were the remains of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] construction. Similarly, the [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]] ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|Seafarer]]'' speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants.  Even natural geologic features such as the massive [[basalt]] columns of the [[Giant's Causeway]] on the coast of [[Northern Ireland]] were attributed to construction by giants.  Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.\n\nMedieval romances such as the Spanish ''[[Amad\u00eds de Gaula]]'' feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'', when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase [[tilting at windmills]].\n\nTales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].  Celtic giants also figure in [[Breton literature|Breton]] and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats, and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and their follower [[Edmund Spenser]].  In the small [[Scotland|Scottish]] village of [[Kinloch Rannoch]], a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head, shoulders, and torso of a man, and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants, perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology, feature as frequent opponents of [[Dietrich von Bern]] in medieval German tales \u2013 in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.\n\nMany giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=63}}  A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=64}}\n\nOther English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other.  This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=65}}\n\nGiants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories, such as ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'', ''[[The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body]]'', ''[[Nix Nought Nothing]]'', ''[[Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon]]'', ''[[Young Ronald]]'', and [[Paul Bunyan (lumberjack)|Paul Bunyan]]. [[Ogre]]s and [[troll]]s are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another, Slavic, folklore giant is [[R\u00fcbezahl]], a kind giant from [[Wendish folklore]] who lived in the [[Krkono\u0161e|Giant Mountains]] (nowadays on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]]\u2013[[Poland|Polish]] border). Additionally, mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size, e.g. the [[Bergm\u00f6nch]], a [[German folklore|German]] mountain spirit.<ref>Wilhelm Grimm, Jacob Grimm: ''Deutsche Sagen''. Hamburg 2014, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn [[Kalevala]], [[Antero Vipunen]] is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. Epic hero [[V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen]] sets out to learn these spells from him, but Vipunen is buried underground, and when V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen digs him out, he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen.

This character also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman, similar to a female version of the Greek [[Heracles]]). \"[[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]]\" is the name of a modern town on the spot.\n\n=== Basque  ===\nGiants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of [[San Martin Txiki]], while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures ([[dolmen]]s, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.\n\nHowever, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as [[jentilak]] and [[mairuak]], while as individuals they can be represented as [[Basajaun]] (\"the lord of the forests\"), Sanson (development of the biblical [[Samson]]), Errolan (based on the [[Franks|Frankish]] army general [[Roland]] who fell dead at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]) or even [[Tartalo]] (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]).\n\n=== Bulgarian ===\n{{Main|Ispolin (Bulgarian mythology)}}\nIn [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] mythology, giants called [[Ispolin (Bulgarian mythology)|ispolini]] inhabited the Earth before modern humans.

They were involved in a conflict with the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] called the ''[[Gigantomachy]]'' (\u0393\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) when Gaia had them attack [[Mount Olympus]]. This battle was eventually settled when the hero [[Heracles]] decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]], to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s.\n\n[[Herodotus]] in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in [[Tegea]] the body of [[Orestes]], which was seven cubits long\u2014around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book ''The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus'' [[Plutarch]] describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of [[Theseus]], which was ''of more than ordinary size''. The kneecaps of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.\n\nThe [[Cyclopes]], are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa, and nemesis of Odysseus, comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.\n\nThe [[Hecatoncheires]] are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.\n\nOther known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed [[Gegenees|Gegeines]], the northern [[Hyperborea]]ns, and the cannibalistic [[Laestrygonians]].\n\n=== Hindu ===\n{{Refimprove section||date=November 2015}}\nIn [[Hinduism]], the giants are called [[Daitya]]s. The Daityas (\u0926\u0948\u0924\u094d\u092f) were the children of [[Diti]] and the sage [[Kashyapa]] who fought against the gods or [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race, they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely [[Danavas]] and [[Asuras]]. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called [[Rakshasas]], the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include [[Hiranyakashipu]] and [[Hiranyaksha]].

R. Harrington (15 February 1929). \"Lovelock Cave\". University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology (University of California at Berkeley) 25 (1): 1\u2013183.</ref> Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.<ref name=\"Greene2005\">{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Michael S|title=Nevada: A Journey of Discovery|year=2005|page=39|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Utah|isbn=1-58685-139-X}}</ref>\n\n[[Adrienne Mayor]] writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book, ''Legends of the First Americans''.<ref name=\"Mayor2005\">{{cite book|last=Mayor|first=Adrienne|title=Fossil legends of the first Americans|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-11345-9}}</ref> She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.\n\n[[Aztec ]] features the [[Quinametzin]], a race of giant men created in one of the previous [[Five Suns|solar eras]]. They are credited for the construction of [[Teotihuacan]].\n\n=== Norse ===\n{{main| J\u00f6tunn}}\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the Jotun (''[[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]]'' in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], a cognate with ''[[wikt:ettin|ettin]]'') are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (''hr\u00edm\u00feursar''), fire giants (''eldj\u00f6tnar''), and mountain giants (''bergrisar'').\n\nThe giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the [[Fenrisulfr]]), and in the eventual battle of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] the giants will storm [[Asgard]] and fight them, until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages, and there are giants such as [[\u00c6gir]], [[Loki]], [[M\u00edmir]], and [[Ska\u00f0i]], who bear little difference in status to them. The Chief God [[Odin]] was the great-grand son of the Giant [[Ymir]].\n\nNorse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions, which name is considered by some to share a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] with the name [[Yama]] of Indo-Iranian mythology.\n\nAn old [[Iceland]]ic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near [[Drangey]] Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"Old Hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.\n\nA ''bergrisi'' \u2013 the traditional Protector of Southwestern Iceland \u2013 appears as a [[supporter]] on the [[coat of arms of Iceland]].\n\n=== Roman  ===\n[[File:Herakles Antaios Louvre G103.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hercules]] faces the giant [[Antaios]] in this illustration on a calix [[krater]], c. 515\u2013510 BC.]]\nSeveral [[Jupiter Column|Jupiter-Giant-Columns]] have been found in [[Germania Superior]]. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a Giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura and Alsace.\n\n=== Other European  ===\n[[File:Walter Crane King Arthur and the Giant Book I, Canto VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[King Arthur]] faces a giant in this engraving by [[Walter Crane]].]]\nIn [[folklore]] from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations.  [[Saxo Grammaticus]], for example, argues that giants had to exist, because nothing else would explain the large walls, stone monuments, and statues that we now know were the remains of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] construction. Similarly, the [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]] ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|Seafarer]]'' speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants.  Even natural geologic features such as the massive [[basalt]] columns of the [[Giant's Causeway]] on the coast of [[Northern Ireland]] were attributed to construction by giants.  Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.\n\nMedieval romances such as the Spanish ''[[Amad\u00eds de Gaula]]'' feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'', when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase [[tilting at windmills]].\n\nTales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].  Celtic giants also figure in [[Breton literature|Breton]] and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats, and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and their follower [[Edmund Spenser]].  In the small [[Scotland|Scottish]] village of [[Kinloch Rannoch]], a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head, shoulders, and torso of a man, and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants, perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology, feature as frequent opponents of [[Dietrich von Bern]] in medieval German tales \u2013 in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.\n\nMany giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=63}}  A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=64}}\n\nOther English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other.  This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=65}}\n\nGiants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories, such as ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'', ''[[The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body]]'', ''[[Nix Nought Nothing]]'', ''[[Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon]]'', ''[[Young Ronald]]'', and [[Paul Bunyan (lumberjack)|Paul Bunyan]]. [[Ogre]]s and [[troll]]s are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another, Slavic, folklore giant is [[R\u00fcbezahl]], a kind giant from [[Wendish folklore]] who lived in the [[Krkono\u0161e|Giant Mountains]] (nowadays on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]]\u2013[[Poland|Polish]] border). Additionally, mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size, e.g. the [[Bergm\u00f6nch]], a [[German folklore|German]] mountain spirit.<ref>Wilhelm Grimm, Jacob Grimm: ''Deutsche Sagen''. Hamburg 2014, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn [[Kalevala]], [[Antero Vipunen]] is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. Epic hero [[V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen]] sets out to learn these spells from him, but Vipunen is buried underground, and when V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen digs him out, he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen. V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen then forces Vipunen to submit and sing the spells out by hammering his insides. An analysis by Martti Haavio is that Vipunen is not physically large, but his [[familiar animal]] (astral form) is a [[whale]]. The depiction is not found in the majority of Finnish original stories, and most probably originates from the book's compiler [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkkinen.org/vipunen.html|title=V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen ja Antero Vipunen|work=parkkinen.org}}</ref>\n\n==  Fossil evidence ==\nThrough the centuries, certain archaeologists have searched for fossil evidence of a race of giants.

From there, the highway crosses over US 301 and Falkenburg Road before ending at a [[trumpet interchange]] with [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] in Brandon.<ref name=\"Google Maps\">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=W+Gandy+Blvd&daddr=Exit+15B&geocode=FX6fqQEdPAQV-w%3BFRckqgEdH7gX-w&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=27.963987,-82.448423&sspn=0.009419,0.013797&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=12 |title=overview map of Selmon Expressway |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Express lanes===\nThe reversible express lanes (REL), also known as '''State Road 618A''', begin at Meridian Avenue in downtown Tampa, following the main expressway's path from above in the center median for most of its journey. Almost the entire route is elevated, with the exception of at-grade segments between 26th Street and 39th Street, as well as between 78th Street and I-75. An at-grade provision was made between 26th Street and 39th Street to accommodate the newly opened [[Interstate 4/Selmon Expressway Connector]]. This at-grade portion is equipped with an eastbound (only) slip-ramp to allow commuters from South Tampa to utilize the REL. A toll gantry is located just east of 78th Street and is the only toll gantry along the entire REL. Between 78th Street and US 301, slip-ramps exist for both directions (exiting and entering the REL). The REL crosses over I-75 and ends at Town Center Boulevard in Brandon (near [[Westfield Brandon]]). From there, the highway disperses onto the Brandon Parkway, which connects to Providence Road and other redesigned thoroughfares to allow seamless connection to points within Brandon and surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite map |publisher = MapQuest |title = overview map of Selmon Crosstown Express Lanes |url = http://www.mapquest.com/mq/9-oZMB_pRq4xV1 |year = 2010 |accessdate = April 26, 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121026024905/http://www.mapquest.com/mq/9-oZMB_pRq4xV1 |archivedate = October 26, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Operating hours====\nOn weekdays, the REL operates westbound from 6:00-10:00am. From 10:00am-1:00pm, the road is in transitional operation in which the western segment between 78th Street and Downtown Tampa carries westbound traffic and the eastern segment from US 301 to Brandon Parkway carries eastbound traffic. Then, from 3:00pm through 6:00am the next morning, the entire REL operates eastbound only.<ref name=relhours>{{cite web |url=https://www.tampa-xway.com/reversible-express-lanes/ |title=Reversible Express Lanes |publisher=[[Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority]] |accessdate=June 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn weekends and holidays, the REL stays operating in the eastbound direction from 3:00pm Friday afternoon through 6:00am Monday morning.<ref name=relhours/>\n\n===Lane counts===\nFor most of its length, the Selmon is four lanes (two in each direction). However, some six-lane segments (three lanes in each direction) exist.\n* Four lanes (two in each direction) from Gandy Boulevard to just east of Morgan Street.\n* Six lanes (three in each direction) from just east of Morgan Street to the I-4/Selmon Connector.\n* Four lanes through the I-4/Selmon Connector interchange.\n* Six lanes from the I-4/Selmon Connector to 50th Street.\n* Four lanes from 50th St to just east of 78th Street.\n* Six lanes from just east of 78th St to just west of US 301.\n* Four lanes through the US 301 interchange.\n* Six lanes from just east of US 301 to Falkenburg Road.\n* Four lanes from  Falkenburg Road to I-75\n* The elevated lanes consist of three lanes from Meridian Avenue to just east of 78th Street, narrowing down to two lanes as it travels to the Brandon Parkway.\n\n===Open-road tolling===\nThe Expressway has no staffed toll gates. To accommodate motorists who do not have [[SunPass]] transponders (such as those from out of state), the [[Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority]] and [[Florida's Turnpike Enterprise]] utilize a \"Toll-By-Plate\" program.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=THEA|url=http://www.tampa-xway.com/pages.aspx?ID=51409155112|title=Selmon Expressway Toll by Tag|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110716191952/http://www.tampa-xway.com/pages.aspx?ID=51409155112|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Vehicles without [[SunPass]] transponders are photographed and their license plates are read. If the license plate number is associated with a Toll-by-Plate account, that account is used to pay the toll. If there is no account, notification of the toll is mailed to the vehicle's owner, with penalties being imposed after 30 days. Toll-By-Plate administrative fees are also applied to bills not associated with a registered account.\n\n==History==\n\n===The South Crosstown Expressway===\n{{See also|Tampa Bay Crosstown Expressway System}}\n\nThe Crosstown Expressway is the southern component of what was planned to be a system of expressways throughout the Tampa area from the 1950s to 1970's, but the rest were cancelled by the 1980s due to financial problems, land acquisition and community revolts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050406050102/http://www.bayciti.net/hrd/cncld/cncld.htm Hillsborough's Cancelled Freeways]</ref> The first six miles of the tollway was built in the mid-1970s on a CSX rail line, from the western terminus at Gandy Blvd. at [[Dale Mabry Highway]], making an eastward turn at Platt Street/Willow Avenue, snaking around historic Hyde Park before ending at a 3/4-mile, six lane viaduct, spanning the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] in downtown Tampa, ending at Florida Avenue. Ridership was low when it opened in 1976, as people were less willing to drive the toll road when free roads were available nearby. The remaining nine miles of the expressway was built and opened in stages between 1979 and 1987, with the expressway extending to Falkenburg Road in 1983 and connecting to its eastern terminus of I-75 in 1987.<ref>[http://www.southeastroads.com/fl-618.html Florida @ SouthEastRoads \u2013 Florida 618]</ref>\n\nIn 1975, a contest was held to determine the logo of the expressway. Only one entry was submitted, a picture of pirate [[Jose Gaspar]] with the title \"TAMPA CROSSTOWN EXPRESSWAY\", all on a blue background. This logo was phased out in the early 2000s. In 2006, an \"interim\" logo featuring a bridge over a highway reading \"Selmon-Crosstown Expressway\" was unveiled but was never widely implemented along the expressway. In 2008, a more permanent logo was unveiled, which consists of the FDOT standard \"TOLL 618\" plates and a \"Selmon Expressway\" logo. This new logo, which replaced the previous Crosstown Expressway logos, reads \"SELMON EXPRESSWAY\" with downtown Tampa in purple and three ribbons, a yellow one in the middle of two teal ones going towards the city.\n\nIn 2001, a city truck equipped with a hydraulic lift slammed into the 34th Street overpass when the vehicle's lift was unknowingly raised. The accident crippled a support beam, which had to be replaced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 2005, a similar vehicle destroyed the overhead exit sign at Euclid Ave (Exit 2) and over a month passed before a replacement sign (and structure) were installed. Also, over the years there have been a few accidents that made headlines, where vehicles, traveling at high speeds, crashed into one of the toll plazas.\n\nIn 2004, the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority accelerated a planned toll hike that would increase the mainline toll plazas by 25 cents and raise the 22nd St Exit tolls to 75 cents from its original date in 2009 to 2007. The toll hike took effect on January 1, 2007, with the hike for the 22nd St ramps going into effect in late June 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nOn September 17, 2010, cash collection on the Selmon Expressway ended in favor of [[open road tolling]]. The original toll plazas were removed and replaced with toll gantries similar to the ones installed on the express lanes, allowing free-flowing movement throughout the tollway. The tollway takes either SunPass or \"We Bill You,\" and customers who do not have either account will be billed later for their use on the expressway.<ref>[http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/08-19_AET%20Conversion_Rev2.pdf Selmon Expressway Converts to All-Electronic Tolling Sept. 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192324/http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/08-19_AET%20Conversion_Rev2.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/LaneShifts%20Feb%202010.pdf Selmon Expressway Prepares for September 2010 Conversion to All-Electronic Tolling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192255/http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/LaneShifts%20Feb%202010.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Grayson|last=Kamm|publisher=10 Connects|date=January 14, 2009|url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=98077|title=Bye bye, toll booths: Selmon Expressway to stop taking cash}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===The reversible elevated lanes===\n{{tone|section|reason=inappropriate news style|date=May 2018}}\nThe reversible elevated lanes (REL), aimed at cutting traffic congestion times, were originally envisioned in 1995 by the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) as an innovative idea to increase capacity along the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway from Downtown Tampa to Brandon without acquiring additional right-of-way. Instead, an elevated, three-lane bridge was built over the existing median of the expressway. Planning for the project began around 1995/1996, but final designs/planning were not made until the later 1990s.\n\n[[Image:78th south at 618.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Lee Roy Selmon Expressway and the Reversible Express Lanes at 78th Street]]\nConstruction commenced in 2003 but in 2004, a portion of the elevated [[bridge]] collapsed during construction, halting construction for about a year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The segment was repaired and all other piers were reinforced when construction resumed in 2005.\n\nIn spring 2005, two realigned sections of the eastbound lanes opened. One section is between 22nd Street and 39th Street, the other between 78th Street and I-75. The at-grade sections of the reversible lanes now follow the old alignments. The Brandon Gateway section of the elevated bridge opened in November 2005 and gained an overwhelmingly positive input by commuters. Thus the bridge was kept open beyond January 2006 (when it was originally scheduled to close for more bridge work) during the evening rush hour.\n\n[[Image:Meridian north at JFK.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The western end of the reversible lanes bridge empties traffic onto the recently reconstructed Meridian Avenue]]\nOn July 18, 2006 at 6&nbsp;am, the [[reversible lane]]s opened to westbound morning traffic (only).<ref>{{cite news|date=July 17, 2006|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/07/17/Hillsborough/Crosstown_s_Brandon_l.shtml |work=St Petersburg Times |title= Crosstown's Brandon link opens Tuesday}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=July 18, 2006 |url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2006/7/18/169343.html?title=Good%20news%20for%20Hillsborough%20County%20commuters |publisher=Bay News 9 |title=Good news for Hillsborough County commuters |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021717/http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2006/7/18/169343.html?title=Good%20news%20for%20Hillsborough%20County%20commuters |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Long lines were formed at the Brandon Gateway well in advance as many anticipated using the new road. However, the scene from news helicopter snapshots showed that only a handful of drivers actually ended up using the new bridge, compared to the number that was expected. These findings may be blamed partly on the lack of advance notification to commuters, the number of commuters who own a SunPass transponder, and an unrelated traffic incident on Ashley Drive in downtown Tampa. Many other questions were raised as a result of the low traffic volume along the reversible lanes.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} The eastbound direction opened to traffic on August 29, 2006 at 3:30&nbsp;pm. A \"Grand Opening\" celebration was held on September 23, 2006, with festivities including a 5k and 10k run across the new bridge.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, [[Florida's Turnpike|Florida's Turnpike Enterprise]] began a pilot program with the THEA, known as \"Toll-by-Plate.\" This program allows occasional commuters to utilize the reversible express lanes through a system of high-resolution cameras (at the 78th Street barrier checkpoint/gantry) which snap photos of license plates. The commuter is then sent a bill via mail. The THEA reports that over 500 commuters have already signed up for the Toll-by-Plate program since its debut. The program's success so far may lead to future expansion to other tolled thoroughfares in Florida, such as the lower level of the Selmon Expressway, and the Veterans Expressway/Suncoast Parkway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2007/5/9/247680.html?title=Toll-by-plate+off+to+fast+start|title=Toll-by-plate off to fast start|date=May 9, 2007|publisher=Bay News 9|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021747/http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2007/5/9/247680.html?title=Toll-by-plate+off+to+fast+start|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The project was officially completed in 2007 after four years of construction at a cost of $420 million.\n\nLevel of service was upgraded from an \"F\" to an \"A\" as commuters are now able to travel at full speed, cutting travel time by as much as 60 minutes per day. The elevated lanes project won the prestigious \"2007 IBTTA President's Award: Most Innovative Toll Transportation Project in the World,\" along with 22 awards for engineering excellence and community-friendly design.

The expressway was built in stages, opening between 1976 and 1987.\n\nThe expressway was supposed to be part of a multi-expressway system that failed in the 1970s due to heavy local opposition and financial burdens. The original designation for the expressway was '''State Road 449''', but was switched to '''State Road 618''', which remained a hidden designation until the early 2000s, when it began appearing on maps and in atlases.\n\nThe expressway features an elevated bridge, the world's first reversible, all-electronic, elevated [[express lane]] project, opened in 2006, with the hidden designation of '''State Road 618A'''.<ref name=\"2008fdotir\"/> The entire expressway ended cash collection on September 17, 2010, going all-electronic for both the express lanes and the main expressway.\n\nThe expressway was renamed '''Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway'''  in 1999, in honor of former [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|hall-of-fame]] football player [[Lee Roy Selmon]]. The \"Crosstown\" portion of the name was dropped in 2008, although it is still referred to as the \"Crosstown\" by the majority of the population. Most traffic reports and locals refer to it as the Crosstown.\n\n==Route description==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}\n[[File:Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway Tampa.jpg|thumb|The Selmon Expressway entering downtown Tampa (looking west), with the elevated, reversible lanes in the bottom-right, curving out of the image, then re-entering the image in the right-center and traveling beneath the mainline to Meridian Avenue.]]\nThe tollway begins at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 92]] (Gandy Boulevard) and [[Dale Mabry Highway]] north of MacDill Air Force Base. It makes its way northeast along a lightly used [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] rail corridor for the first four miles before heading east towards downtown Tampa. From Florida Ave, the highway winds through the [[Channel District|Channelside District]] and the southern fringe of [[Ybor City]] before continuing due eastward towards 78th St. There is a connection to [[Interstate 4|I-4]] just east of 22nd St that allows commuters to easily move between various points throughout Hillsborough County and beyond. Just west of 78th St, the expressway crosses over Palm River (the southernmost portion of the [[Tampa Bypass Canal]]) and makes a southeastward curve towards [[U.S. Route 301 in Florida|US 301]]. From there, the highway crosses over US 301 and Falkenburg Road before ending at a [[trumpet interchange]] with [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] in Brandon.<ref name=\"Google Maps\">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=W+Gandy+Blvd&daddr=Exit+15B&geocode=FX6fqQEdPAQV-w%3BFRckqgEdH7gX-w&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=27.963987,-82.448423&sspn=0.009419,0.013797&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=12 |title=overview map of Selmon Expressway |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Express lanes===\nThe reversible express lanes (REL), also known as '''State Road 618A''', begin at Meridian Avenue in downtown Tampa, following the main expressway's path from above in the center median for most of its journey. Almost the entire route is elevated, with the exception of at-grade segments between 26th Street and 39th Street, as well as between 78th Street and I-75. An at-grade provision was made between 26th Street and 39th Street to accommodate the newly opened [[Interstate 4/Selmon Expressway Connector]]. This at-grade portion is equipped with an eastbound (only) slip-ramp to allow commuters from South Tampa to utilize the REL. A toll gantry is located just east of 78th Street and is the only toll gantry along the entire REL. Between 78th Street and US 301, slip-ramps exist for both directions (exiting and entering the REL). The REL crosses over I-75 and ends at Town Center Boulevard in Brandon (near [[Westfield Brandon]]). From there, the highway disperses onto the Brandon Parkway, which connects to Providence Road and other redesigned thoroughfares to allow seamless connection to points within Brandon and surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite map |publisher = MapQuest |title = overview map of Selmon Crosstown Express Lanes |url = http://www.mapquest.com/mq/9-oZMB_pRq4xV1 |year = 2010 |accessdate = April 26, 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121026024905/http://www.mapquest.com/mq/9-oZMB_pRq4xV1 |archivedate = October 26, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Operating hours====\nOn weekdays, the REL operates westbound from 6:00-10:00am. From 10:00am-1:00pm, the road is in transitional operation in which the western segment between 78th Street and Downtown Tampa carries westbound traffic and the eastern segment from US 301 to Brandon Parkway carries eastbound traffic. Then, from 3:00pm through 6:00am the next morning, the entire REL operates eastbound only.<ref name=relhours>{{cite web |url=https://www.tampa-xway.com/reversible-express-lanes/ |title=Reversible Express Lanes |publisher=[[Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority]] |accessdate=June 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn weekends and holidays, the REL stays operating in the eastbound direction from 1:00pm Friday afternoon through 4:00am Monday morning.<ref name=relhours/>\n\n===Lane counts===\nFor most of its length, the Selmon is four lanes (two in each direction). However, some six-lane segments (three lanes in each direction) exist.\n* Four lanes (two in each direction) from Gandy Boulevard to just east of Morgan Street.\n* Six lanes (three in each direction) from just east of Morgan Street to the I-4/Selmon Connector.\n* Four lanes through the I-4/Selmon Connector interchange.\n* Six lanes from the I-4/Selmon Connector to 50th Street.\n* Four lanes from 50th St to just east of 78th Street.\n* Six lanes from just east of 78th St to just west of US 301.\n* Four lanes through the US 301 interchange.\n* Six lanes from just east of US 301 to Falkenburg Road.\n* Four lanes from  Falkenburg Road to I-75\n* The elevated lanes consist of three lanes from Meridian Avenue to just east of 78th Street, narrowing down to two lanes as it travels to the Brandon Parkway.\n\n===Open-road tolling===\nThe Expressway has no staffed toll gates. To accommodate motorists who do not have [[SunPass]] transponders (such as those from out of state), the [[Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority]] and [[Florida's Turnpike Enterprise]] utilize a \"Toll-By-Plate\" program.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=THEA|url=http://www.tampa-xway.com/pages.aspx?ID=51409155112|title=Selmon Expressway Toll by Tag|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110716191952/http://www.tampa-xway.com/pages.aspx?ID=51409155112|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Vehicles without [[SunPass]] transponders are photographed and their license plates are read. If the license plate number is associated with a Toll-by-Plate account, that account is used to pay the toll. If there is no account, notification of the toll is mailed to the vehicle's owner, with penalties being imposed after 30 days. Toll-By-Plate administrative fees are also applied to bills not associated with a registered account.\n\n==History==\n\n===The South Crosstown Expressway===\n{{See also|Tampa Bay Crosstown Expressway System}}\n\nThe Crosstown Expressway is the southern component of what was planned to be a system of expressways throughout the Tampa area from the 1950s to 1970's, but the rest were cancelled by the 1980s due to financial problems, land acquisition and community revolts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050406050102/http://www.bayciti.net/hrd/cncld/cncld.htm Hillsborough's Cancelled Freeways]</ref> The first six miles of the tollway was built in the mid-1970s on a CSX rail line, from the western terminus at Gandy Blvd. at [[Dale Mabry Highway]], making an eastward turn at Platt Street/Willow Avenue, snaking around historic Hyde Park before ending at a 3/4-mile, six lane viaduct, spanning the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] in downtown Tampa, ending at Florida Avenue. Ridership was low when it opened in 1976, as people were less willing to drive the toll road when free roads were available nearby. The remaining nine miles of the expressway was built and opened in stages between 1979 and 1987, with the expressway extending to Falkenburg Road in 1983 and connecting to its eastern terminus of I-75 in 1987.<ref>[http://www.southeastroads.com/fl-618.html Florida @ SouthEastRoads \u2013 Florida 618]</ref>\n\nIn 1975, a contest was held to determine the logo of the expressway. Only one entry was submitted, a picture of pirate [[Jose Gaspar]] with the title \"TAMPA CROSSTOWN EXPRESSWAY\", all on a blue background. This logo was phased out in the early 2000s. In 2006, an \"interim\" logo featuring a bridge over a highway reading \"Selmon-Crosstown Expressway\" was unveiled but was never widely implemented along the expressway. In 2008, a more permanent logo was unveiled, which consists of the FDOT standard \"TOLL 618\" plates and a \"Selmon Expressway\" logo. This new logo, which replaced the previous Crosstown Expressway logos, reads \"SELMON EXPRESSWAY\" with downtown Tampa in purple and three ribbons, a yellow one in the middle of two teal ones going towards the city.\n\nIn 2001, a city truck equipped with a hydraulic lift slammed into the 34th Street overpass when the vehicle's lift was unknowingly raised. The accident crippled a support beam, which had to be replaced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 2005, a similar vehicle destroyed the overhead exit sign at Euclid Ave (Exit 2) and over a month passed before a replacement sign (and structure) were installed. Also, over the years there have been a few accidents that made headlines, where vehicles, traveling at high speeds, crashed into one of the toll plazas.\n\nIn 2004, the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority accelerated a planned toll hike that would increase the mainline toll plazas by 25 cents and raise the 22nd St Exit tolls to 75 cents from its original date in 2009 to 2007. The toll hike took effect on January 1, 2007, with the hike for the 22nd St ramps going into effect in late June 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nOn September 17, 2010, cash collection on the Selmon Expressway ended in favor of [[open road tolling]]. The original toll plazas were removed and replaced with toll gantries similar to the ones installed on the express lanes, allowing free-flowing movement throughout the tollway. The tollway takes either SunPass or \"We Bill You,\" and customers who do not have either account will be billed later for their use on the expressway.<ref>[http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/08-19_AET%20Conversion_Rev2.pdf Selmon Expressway Converts to All-Electronic Tolling Sept. 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192324/http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/08-19_AET%20Conversion_Rev2.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/LaneShifts%20Feb%202010.pdf Selmon Expressway Prepares for September 2010 Conversion to All-Electronic Tolling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192255/http://www.tampa-xway.com/images/editor/LaneShifts%20Feb%202010.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Grayson|last=Kamm|publisher=10 Connects|date=January 14, 2009|url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=98077|title=Bye bye, toll booths: Selmon Expressway to stop taking cash}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===The reversible elevated lanes===\n{{tone|section|reason=inappropriate news style|date=May 2018}}\nThe reversible elevated lanes (REL), aimed at cutting traffic congestion times, were originally envisioned in 1995 by the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) as an innovative idea to increase capacity along the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway from Downtown Tampa to Brandon without acquiring additional right-of-way. Instead, an elevated, three-lane bridge was built over the existing median of the expressway. Planning for the project began around 1995/1996, but final designs/planning were not made until the later 1990s.\n\n[[Image:78th south at 618.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Lee Roy Selmon Expressway and the Reversible Express Lanes at 78th Street]]\nConstruction commenced in 2003 but in 2004, a portion of the elevated [[bridge]] collapsed during construction, halting construction for about a year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The segment was repaired and all other piers were reinforced when construction resumed in 2005.\n\nIn spring 2005, two realigned sections of the eastbound lanes opened. One section is between 22nd Street and 39th Street, the other between 78th Street and I-75. The at-grade sections of the reversible lanes now follow the old alignments. The Brandon Gateway section of the elevated bridge opened in November 2005 and gained an overwhelmingly positive input by commuters. Thus the bridge was kept open beyond January 2006 (when it was originally scheduled to close for more bridge work) during the evening rush hour.\n\n[[Image:Meridian north at JFK.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The western end of the reversible lanes bridge empties traffic onto the recently reconstructed Meridian Avenue]]\nOn July 18, 2006 at 6&nbsp;am, the [[reversible lane]]s opened to westbound morning traffic (only).<ref>{{cite news|date=July 17, 2006|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/07/17/Hillsborough/Crosstown_s_Brandon_l.shtml |work=St Petersburg Times |title= Crosstown's Brandon link opens Tuesday}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=July 18, 2006 |url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2006/7/18/169343.html?title=Good%20news%20for%20Hillsborough%20County%20commuters |publisher=Bay News 9 |title=Good news for Hillsborough County commuters |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021717/http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2006/7/18/169343.html?title=Good%20news%20for%20Hillsborough%20County%20commuters |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Long lines were formed at the Brandon Gateway well in advance as many anticipated using the new road. However, the scene from news helicopter snapshots showed that only a handful of drivers actually ended up using the new bridge, compared to the number that was expected. These findings may be blamed partly on the lack of advance notification to commuters, the number of commuters who own a SunPass transponder, and an unrelated traffic incident on Ashley Drive in downtown Tampa. Many other questions were raised as a result of the low traffic volume along the reversible lanes.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} The eastbound direction opened to traffic on August 29, 2006 at 3:30&nbsp;pm. A \"Grand Opening\" celebration was held on September 23, 2006, with festivities including a 5k and 10k run across the new bridge.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, [[Florida's Turnpike|Florida's Turnpike Enterprise]] began a pilot program with the THEA, known as \"Toll-by-Plate.\" This program allows occasional commuters to utilize the reversible express lanes through a system of high-resolution cameras (at the 78th Street barrier checkpoint/gantry) which snap photos of license plates. The commuter is then sent a bill via mail. The THEA reports that over 500 commuters have already signed up for the Toll-by-Plate program since its debut. The program's success so far may lead to future expansion to other tolled thoroughfares in Florida, such as the lower level of the Selmon Expressway, and the Veterans Expressway/Suncoast Parkway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2007/5/9/247680.html?title=Toll-by-plate+off+to+fast+start|title=Toll-by-plate off to fast start|date=May 9, 2007|publisher=Bay News 9|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021747/http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2007/5/9/247680.html?title=Toll-by-plate+off+to+fast+start|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The project was officially completed in 2007 after four years of construction at a cost of $420 million.\n\nLevel of service was upgraded from an \"F\" to an \"A\" as commuters are now able to travel at full speed, cutting travel time by as much as 60 minutes per day. The elevated lanes project won the prestigious \"2007 IBTTA President's Award: Most Innovative Toll Transportation Project in the World,\" along with 22 awards for engineering excellence and community-friendly design.
