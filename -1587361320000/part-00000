It was released on 12 September 2008 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Holocaust]] drama relates the horror of a [[Nazi]] [[extermination camp]] through the eyes of two 8-year-old boys; Bruno ([[Asa Butterfield]]), the son of the camp's Nazi commandant, and Shmuel ([[Jack Scanlon]]), a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[prisoner|inmate]].\n\nThe film has drawn criticism from some Holocaust educators for its factual inaccuracy.\n\n==Plot==\nA young boy named Bruno lives in [[Berlin]], in [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. His father Ralf is promoted, and relocates the family to the \"countryside\" ([[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]). Living without neighbours, far from any town, Bruno becomes lonely and bored. After spotting people working on what he thinks is a farm in the distance \u2013 actually a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] \u2013 he is forbidden from playing in the back garden.\n\nBruno and his sister Gretel\u2019s tutor, Herr Liszt, pushes an agenda of [[antisemitism]] and [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]]. This, together with Gretel's infatuation with [[Lieutenant]] Kurt Kotler, makes her fanatical in her support for the Third Reich, to the point of covering her bedroom wall with posters and portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Bruno is confused, as the only [[Jews|Jew]] he has seen, the family's servant Pavel, does not resemble the antisemitic caricatures in Liszt's teachings.\n\nBruno sneaks into the woods, arriving at a barbed wire fence surrounding the camp. He befriends a boy named Shmuel, and their ignorance of the camp\u2019s true nature is revealed: Bruno thinks the striped uniforms that Shmuel, Pavel, and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas, and Shmuel believes his grandparents died from an illness during their journey to the camp. Bruno meets Shmuel regularly, sneaking him food and playing board games. He learns Shmuel is a Jew, brought to the camp with his father and mother.\n\n[[File:Sachsenhausen clothes.jpg|thumb|left|Prisoner's clothing from [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]]]\nBruno\u2019s mother Elsa discovers the reality of Ralf's assignment after Kotler lets slip that the black smoke coming from the camp's chimneys is due to the burning corpses of Jews, and she confronts Ralf. At dinner, Kotler admits that his father had left his family for [[Switzerland]]. Ralf tells Kotler that he should have informed the authorities of his father's disagreement with the current political regime. Embarrassed, Kotler violently beats Pavel for spilling a glass of wine.\n\nBruno sees Shmuel working in his home, and offers him some cake. When Kotler finds Bruno and Shmuel socialising, he berates Shmuel, and notices him chewing. Shmuel explains that Bruno offered the cake, which the fearful Bruno denies, and Kotler tells Shmuel they will have a \"little chat\" later. Bruno goes to apologise to Shmuel, but finds him gone. He returns to the fence every day, and eventually Shmuel reappears, sporting a black eye. Bruno apologises and Shmuel forgives him, renewing their friendship.\n\nAfter the funeral of his grandmother, killed in Berlin by an Allied bombing, Ralf tells Bruno and Gretel that their mother suggests they live with a relative where it is safer; in truth, Elsa does not want her children living with their murderous father. Shmuel\u2019s father has gone missing after participating in a march, and Bruno decides to redeem himself by helping Shmuel find his father. Donning a prisoner\u2019s striped outfit and a cap to cover his unshaven head, Bruno digs under the fence to join Shmuel. He is shocked to see the many sick and weak-looking Jews, and the boys are taken on a march with other inmates by [[Sonderkommando]]s.\n\nAt the house, Gretel and Elsa discover Bruno's disappearance, and Elsa bursts into Ralf's meeting to alert him that Bruno is missing. Ralf and his men mount a search, with Elsa and Gretel following behind. A dog tracks Bruno's scent to his discarded clothing outside the fence, and Ralf enters the camp. Bruno, Shmuel, and the inmates are taken to a changing room and told to remove their clothes for a \"shower\". They are packed into a [[gas chamber]], as a [[Schutzstaffel]] soldier pours [[Zyklon B]] pellets inside, and the prisoners begin panicking. When Ralf realises that a gassing is taking place, he cries out his son's name; at the fence, Elsa and Gretel hear Ralf's cries and fall to their knees in despair. The film ends by showing the closed door of the now silent gas chamber, indicating that all prisoners, including Bruno and Shmuel, are dead.\n\n==Production==\nFilming was completed during 29 April 2007 to 7 July 2007, in [[Hungary]].

When Ralf realises that a gassing is taking place, he cries out his son's name; at the fence, Elsa and Gretel hear Ralf's cries and fall to their knees in despair. The film ends by showing the closed door of the now silent gas chamber, indicating that all prisoners, including Bruno and Shmuel, are dead.\n\n==Production==\nFilming was completed during 29 April 2007 to 7 July 2007, in [[Hungary]].

Purposeful speaking therefore involves a trade-off of costs and benefits.\n** The [[principle of least effort]] tends to result in phonetic reduction of speech forms. See [[vowel reduction]], [[cluster reduction]], [[lenition]], and [[elision]]. After some time a change may become widely accepted (it becomes a regular [[sound change]]) and may end up treated as [[standard language|standard]]. For instance: ''going to'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261o\u028a.\u026a\u014b.t\u028a]}} \u2192 ''gonna'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u0254n\u0259]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u028cn\u0259]}}, with examples of both vowel reduction {{IPA|[\u028a] \u2192 [\u0259]}} and elision {{IPA|[nt] \u2192 [n]}}, {{IPA|[o\u028a.\u026a] \u2192 [\u028c]}}.\n* Expressiveness: Common or overused language tends to lose its emotional or rhetorical intensity over time; therefore, new words and constructions are continuously employed to revive that intensity<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/>\n* [[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]]: Over time, speech communities unconsciously apply patterns of rules in certain words, sounds, etc. to unrelated other words, sounds, etc.\n* [[Language contact]]: Words and constructions are borrowed from one language into another.<ref name=\"llas.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/2784|title=The teaching of pidgin and Creole studies - LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n* Geographic separation: When people with one language move away from each other, the language will gradually diverge into separate dialects, due to different experiences.<ref name=Cambridge>''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (1997, p. 335)</ref>\n* [[Culture|Cultural environment]]: As a culture evolves, new places, situations, and objects inevitably enter its language, whether or not the culture encounters different people.\n* Migration/Movement: Speech communities, moving into a region with a new or more complex linguistic situation, will influence, and be influenced by, language change; they sometimes even end up with entirely new languages, such as pidgins and creoles.<ref name=\"llas.ac.uk\"/>\n* Imperfect learning: According to one view, children regularly learn the adult forms imperfectly, and the changed forms then turn into a new standard. Alternatively, imperfect learning occurs regularly in one part of society, such as an immigrant group, where the minority language forms a [[substratum]], and the changed forms can ultimately influence majority usage.<ref name=Cambridge/>\n* Social prestige: Language may not only change towards features that have more [[social prestige]], but also away from ones with negative prestige,<ref name=Cambridge/> as in the case of the [[Rhoticity in English|loss of rhoticity]] in the British [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2012/10/07/was-received-pronunciation-ever-rhotic/|title=Was Received Pronunciation Ever Rhotic?|last=Ben|date=7 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Such movements can go back and forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/the-fall-of-the-r-less-class|title=The fall of the r-less class - Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]], the tricky question is \"Why are changes not brought up short and stopped in their tracks? At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \"[[Variety (linguistics)|synchronic variation]]\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"<ref name=\"Deutscher\">The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71</ref>\n\n==Types==\nAll languages change continually,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Agrippa\n| first1                = Heinrich Cornelius\n| author-link1          = Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\n| year              = 1510\n| chapter               = 23: Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\n| title                 = De Occulta Philosophia\n|trans-title=Occult Philosophy\n| publication-date      = 1651\n| quote                 = [...] all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions [...].\n}}\n</ref>\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the '''external evolution'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 74\u201398\n|quote= [...] the shifting movements of languages in light of whatever knowledge is available of the history of humanity.\n}}\n</ref>\nand '''internal evolution''' of languages.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 98\u2013141\n|quote= Internal evolution [...] is the passing from one system to another.

Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].\n\n[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nIn the English language, there occurred a shift from common words (e.g. house) towards the use of rarer words (e.g. building), but on a marginal level. Within over 300 years, the relative frequency of words in samples of English and American newspapers decreased only about three units within a possible theoretical range of 208 units that is 1-2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Phonetic and phonological changes===\n{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}\n\nThe concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William \n| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/988800917eda494963e28b62f6821d0f51000b84\n| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 273\u2013309 \n| doi = 10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799 \n}}\n</ref>\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society \u2014 compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\n===Spelling changes===\n\nStandardisation of [[spelling]] originated centuries ago.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\n<!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.\n\nModern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as \"night\" hints at an older pronunciation, the \"gh\" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by \"ch\" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the \"k\"-sound once pronounced in words like \"knee\" or \"knight\", and the \"ch\" in \"chicken\" or \"cheese\", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].\n\nOne could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word \"eyren\" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, \"egges\" (modern English: \"eggs\").\n-->\n\n===Semantic changes===\n{{Main|Semantic change}}\n\nSemantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative\n* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive\n* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses\n* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Syntactic change===\n{{Main|Syntactic change}}\n\n[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes \u2013 attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] \u2013 may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Sociolinguistics==\n\nThe [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] Jennifer Coates, and sajjad haider uos  following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic [[heterogeneity]]. She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"<ref>Coates, 1992: 169</ref>\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nKadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in XV-XVI centuries the government played key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive norms]] with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be effciently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

They then speculate that technological innovation (transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, and perceived status change. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the \"higher-status\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calque]]\n* [[Grammaticalization]]\n* [[Koin\u00e9 language]]\n* [[Morphemization]]\n* [[Neologism]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Phono-semantic matching]]\n* [[Wave model (linguistics)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n;Journals\n*{{cite journal |last1=Altintas |first1=K. |last2=Can |first2=F. |last3=Patton |first3=J.

Purposeful speaking therefore involves a trade-off of costs and benefits.\n** The [[principle of least effort]] tends to result in phonetic reduction of speech forms. See [[vowel reduction]], [[cluster reduction]], [[lenition]], and [[elision]]. After some time a change may become widely accepted (it becomes a regular [[sound change]]) and may end up treated as [[standard language|standard]]. For instance: ''going to'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261o\u028a.\u026a\u014b.t\u028a]}} \u2192 ''gonna'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u0254n\u0259]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u028cn\u0259]}}, with examples of both vowel reduction {{IPA|[\u028a] \u2192 [\u0259]}} and elision {{IPA|[nt] \u2192 [n]}}, {{IPA|[o\u028a.\u026a] \u2192 [\u028c]}}.\n* Expressiveness: Common or overused language tends to lose its emotional or rhetorical intensity over time; therefore, new words and constructions are continuously employed to revive that intensity<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/>\n* [[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]]: Over time, speech communities unconsciously apply patterns of rules in certain words, sounds, etc. to unrelated other words, sounds, etc.\n* [[Language contact]]: Words and constructions are borrowed from one language into another.<ref name=\"llas.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/2784|title=The teaching of pidgin and Creole studies - LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n* Geographic separation: When people with one language move away from each other, the language will gradually diverge into separate dialects, due to different experiences.<ref name=Cambridge>''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (1997, p. 335)</ref>\n* [[Culture|Cultural environment]]: As a culture evolves, new places, situations, and objects inevitably enter its language, whether or not the culture encounters different people.\n* Migration/Movement: Speech communities, moving into a region with a new or more complex linguistic situation, will influence, and be influenced by, language change; they sometimes even end up with entirely new languages, such as pidgins and creoles.<ref name=\"llas.ac.uk\"/>\n* Imperfect learning: According to one view, children regularly learn the adult forms imperfectly, and the changed forms then turn into a new standard. Alternatively, imperfect learning occurs regularly in one part of society, such as an immigrant group, where the minority language forms a [[substratum]], and the changed forms can ultimately influence majority usage.<ref name=Cambridge/>\n* Social prestige: Language may not only change towards features that have more [[social prestige]], but also away from ones with negative prestige,<ref name=Cambridge/> as in the case of the [[Rhoticity in English|loss of rhoticity]] in the British [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2012/10/07/was-received-pronunciation-ever-rhotic/|title=Was Received Pronunciation Ever Rhotic?|last=Ben|date=7 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Such movements can go back and forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/the-fall-of-the-r-less-class|title=The fall of the r-less class - Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]], the tricky question is \"Why are changes not brought up short and stopped in their tracks? At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \"[[Variety (linguistics)|synchronic variation]]\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"<ref name=\"Deutscher\">The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71</ref>\n\n==Types==\nAll languages change continually,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Agrippa\n| first1                = Heinrich Cornelius\n| author-link1          = Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\n| year              = 1510\n| chapter               = 23: Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\n| title                 = De Occulta Philosophia\n|trans-title=Occult Philosophy\n| publication-date      = 1651\n| quote                 = [...] all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions [...].\n}}\n</ref>\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the '''external evolution'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 74\u201398\n|quote= [...] the shifting movements of languages in light of whatever knowledge is available of the history of humanity.\n}}\n</ref>\nand '''internal evolution''' of languages.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 98\u2013141\n|quote= Internal evolution [...] is the passing from one system to another.

Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].\n\n[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nIn the English language, there occurred a shift from common words (e.g. house) towards the use of rarer words (e.g. building), but on a marginal level. Within over 300 years, the relative frequency of words in samples of English and American newspapers decreased only about three units within a possible theoretical range of 208 units that is 1-2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Phonetic and phonological changes===\n{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}\n\nThe concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William \n| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/988800917eda494963e28b62f6821d0f51000b84\n| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 273\u2013309 \n| doi = 10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799 \n}}\n</ref>\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society \u2014 compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\n===Spelling changes===\n\nStandardisation of [[spelling]] originated centuries ago.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\n<!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.\n\nModern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as \"night\" hints at an older pronunciation, the \"gh\" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by \"ch\" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the \"k\"-sound once pronounced in words like \"knee\" or \"knight\", and the \"ch\" in \"chicken\" or \"cheese\", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].\n\nOne could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word \"eyren\" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, \"egges\" (modern English: \"eggs\").\n-->\n\n===Semantic changes===\n{{Main|Semantic change}}\n\nSemantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative\n* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive\n* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses\n* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Syntactic change===\n{{Main|Syntactic change}}\n\n[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes \u2013 attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] \u2013 may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Sociolinguistics==\n\nThe [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic [[heterogeneity]]. She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"<ref>Coates, 1992: 169</ref>\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nKadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in XV-XVI centuries the government played key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive norms]] with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be effciently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the \"higher-status\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calque]]\n* [[Grammaticalization]]\n* [[Koin\u00e9 language]]\n* [[Morphemization]]\n* [[Neologism]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Phono-semantic matching]]\n* [[Wave model (linguistics)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n;Journals\n*{{cite journal |last1=Altintas |first1=K. |last2=Can |first2=F. |last3=Patton |first3=J.

One can see the mighty Dhauladhar range.  The ridge elevation is between 2,810 and 2,875 metres. It is a one-day trek approx. 10 kilometres (one way) from [[Mcleod Ganj]] bus stand and under 6 kilometres (one way) from Galu temple near Dharamkot.
