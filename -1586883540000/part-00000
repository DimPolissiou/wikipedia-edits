However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of [[grassroots]] fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical [[philanthropy]], the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.\n\nIn addition, the occurrence of polio epidemics led to a number of public health innovations.  One of the most widespread was the proliferation of \"no spitting\" ordinances in the United States and elsewhere.<ref>See David M. Oshinsky, ''Polio: an American Story''.

He tried a wide range of therapies, including [[hydrotherapy]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] (see below).  In 1938 Roosevelt helped to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now known as the [[March of Dimes]]), that raised money for the [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of victims of paralytic polio, and was instrumental in funding the development of [[polio vaccines]].  The March of Dimes changed the way it approached fund-raising.  Rather than soliciting large contributions from a few wealthy individuals, the March of Dimes sought small donations from millions of individuals. Its hugely successful fund-raising campaigns collected hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014more than all of the U.S. [[charities]] at the time combined (with the exception of the [[Red Cross]]).<ref name= Oshinsky>{{cite book |author=Oshinsky DM |title=Polio: an American story |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-19-515294-8 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://archive.org/details/polioamericansto00oshi }}</ref> By 1955 the March of Dimes had invested $25.5 million in research;<ref name=HHMI_FDR>{{cite web | title = FDR and Polio: Public Life, Private Pain | publisher = Howard Hughes Medical Institute | url = http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/disease/polio/polio2.html | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100324105758/http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/disease/polio/polio2.html | archivedate = 2010-03-24 }}</ref> funding both Jonas Salk's and Albert Sabin's vaccine development; the 1954\u201355 field trial of vaccine, and supplies of free vaccine for thousands of children.<ref name=NMAH/>\n\nIn 1952, during the worst recorded epidemic, 3,145 people in the United States died from polio.<ref name=Vital_Statistics_1952>{{cite book | author = Dunn HL | title = Vital Statistics of the United States (1952): Volume II, Mortality Data | publisher = United States Government Printing Office | year = 1955 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/VSUS_1952_2.pdf | format = PDF | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171113010926/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/VSUS_1952_2.pdf | archivedate = 2017-11-13 }}</ref>\n\n===Rehabilitation therapy===\n[[File:Polio physical therapy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[physical therapist]] assists two polio-stricken children while they exercise their lower limbs.]]\nPrior to the polio scares of the twentieth century, most [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation therapy]] was focused on treating injured soldiers returning from war.

In 1938 Roosevelt helped to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now known as the [[March of Dimes]]), that raised money for the [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of victims of paralytic polio, and was instrumental in funding the development of [[polio vaccines]].  The March of Dimes changed the way it approached fund-raising.  Rather than soliciting large contributions from a few wealthy individuals, the March of Dimes sought small donations from millions of individuals.

The first heavy [[depth charge]] jammed the hydroplanes hard up. This caused a tremendous inclination to the stern with the tail of the submarine touching the sea bed at {{convert|300|ft}}. Four more heavy depth charges exploded shaking the boat. The skipper, Lieutenant-Commander Anworth, gave the order to blow the number 5 and 6 [[ballast tank]]s. ''L2'' surfaced and came under fire by the three destroyers from about {{convert|1,500|yd|m}}. One shot struck the [[pressure hull]] just abaft the [[conning tower]]. The crew waved [[white ensign]]s and fired rifles and the destroyers ceased fire. She survived the encounter.\n\n''L2'' was assigned to the [[4th Submarine Flotilla]] and [[HMS Titania]] in 1919 and sailed to [[Hong Kong]], arriving on 14 April 1920, and was placed in the Reserve Flotilla in Hong Kong in 1923.

Four of these were in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and the remaining pair in broadside mounts. They carried 10 reload torpedoes, all for the bow tubes.<ref>Harrison, Chapter 27</ref> ''L2'' was initially fitted with a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[anti-aircraft gun]], but this was later replaced by a {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[deck gun]].<ref>Akermann, p. 165</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\nOriginally [[laid down]] as [[British E-class submarine|E-class submarine]] ''E58'' on 18 May 1916, she and [[sister ship]] {{HMS|E57||2}} incorporated enough changes that they were renamed as the first pair of boats of a newly designated L class. ''L2'' was [[launched (ship)|launched]] 6 July 1917, and [[commissioned (ship)|commissioned]] on 18 December 1917.\n\n''L2'' survived an accidental attack by three American [[destroyer]]s on 24 February 1918. The first heavy [[depth charge]] jammed the hydroplanes hard up. This caused a tremendous inclination to the stern with the tail of the submarine touching the sea bed at {{convert|300|ft}}. Four more heavy depth charges exploded shaking the boat. The skipper, Lieutenant-Commander Anworth, gave the order to blow the number 5 and 6 [[ballast tank]]s. ''L2'' surfaced and came under fire by the three destroyers from about {{convert|1,500|yd|m}}. One shot struck the [[pressure hull]] just abaft the [[conning tower]]. The crew waved [[white ensign]]s and fired rifles and the destroyers ceased fire. She survived the encounter.\n\n''L2'' was assigned to the [[4th Submarine Flotilla]] and [[HMS Titania]] in 1919 and sailed to [[Hong Kong]], arriving on 14 April 1920, and was placed in the Reserve Flotilla in Hong Kong in 1923. She was sold in March 1930, and arrived in April at [[Thos W Ward]], [[Grays]] for break up.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Akermann|first=Paul|title=Encyclopaedia of British Submarines 1901\u20131955|edition=reprint of the 1989|year=2002|publisher=Periscope Publishing|location=Penzance, Cornwall|isbn=1-904381-05-7}}\n*{{Colledge}}\n* {{cite book |editor1-last=Gardiner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Gray|editor2-first=Randal|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906\u20131921|year=1985|location=Annapolis, Maryland|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-85177-245-5|lastauthoramp=y}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.rnsubs.co.uk/Boats/BR3043/chapter07.php|title=The Development of HM Submarines From Holland No. 1 (1901) to Porpoise (1930) (BR3043)|last=Harrison|first=A.

Over the span of his career he played for the [[Montreal Hockey Club]], the professional [[Pittsburgh Bankers]] of the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]], the [[Toronto Professional Hockey Club|Toronto Professionals]] of the [[Ontario Professional Hockey League]] and the [[Portage Lakes Hockey Club]] of the [[International Professional Hockey League]].\n\n==Biography==\nCharlie Liffiton was the son of a jeweler and grew up in a family of one sister and six brothers. He worked in his fathers jewelry and confection store in [[Montreal]], but preferred playing hockey.  During the [[1899 CAHL season|1899\u20131900 season]] of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] Charlie was the second best scorer for his Montreal Hockey Club and the leagues eighth leading scorer posting 8 goals in 8 games. However, during the [[1902 CAHL season|1901\u201302 season]], he helped the Montreal HC win the CAHL championship and later defeat the [[Winnipeg Victorias]] and capture the [[Stanley Cup]]. He was also one of the top ten league scorers for the third season in a row.\n\nLiffiton played only one game of the [[1903 CAHL season|1902\u201303 season]] for Montreal, before traveling to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] to help the Pittsburgh Bankers win the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League championship. The WPHL was a professional league and by playing there, Charlie became a professional player. Over the next two season, he played for the Bankers and at least one match for the [[Montreal Wanderers]].\n\nIn 1904 the Portgage Lakes Hockey Club of [[Houghton, Michigan]] lured him away from the Wanderers to play the remainder of the season for $1350. He was reported to be the highest paid player in the International Professional Hockey League that year. Statistics from his hockey career show he was active through the 1906\u201307 professional exhibition season with the [[Toronto Professional Hockey Club|Toronto Professionals]].\n\n==Family==\nHis younger brother was [[Ernie Liffiton]] who also played professional ice hockey. He is an ancestor of [[David Liffiton]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[New York Rangers]]. Around 1916, Charlie married Lena Margaret Clark. The couple had five children.

Over the span of his career he played for the [[Montreal Hockey Club]], the professional [[Pittsburgh Bankers]] of the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]], the [[Toronto Professional Hockey Club|Toronto Professionals]] of the [[Ontario Professional Hockey League]] and the [[Portage Lakes Hockey Club]] of the [[International Professional Hockey League]].\n\n==Biography==\nCharlie Liffiton was the son of a jeweler and grew up in a family of one sister and six brothers. He worked in his fathers jewelry and confection store in [[Montreal]], but preferred playing hockey.  During the [[1899 CAHL season|1899\u20131900 season]] of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] Charlie was the second best scorer for his Montreal Hockey Club and the leagues eighth leading scorer posting 8 goals in 8 games. However, during the [[1902 CAHL season|1901\u201302 season]], he helped the Montreal HC win the CAHL championship and later defeat the [[Winnipeg Victorias]] and capture the [[Stanley Cup]]. He was also one of the top ten league scorers for the third season in a row.\n\nLiffiton played only one game of the [[1903 CAHL season|1902\u201303 season]] for Montreal, before traveling to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] to help the Pittsburgh Bankers win the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League championship. The WPHL was a professional league and by playing there, Charlie became a professional player. Over the next two season, he played for the Bankers and at least one match for the [[Montreal Wanderers]].\n\nIn 1904 the Portgage Lakes Hockey Club of [[Houghton, Michigan]] lured him away from the Wanderers to play the remainder of the season for $1350. He was reported to be the highest paid player in the International Professional Hockey League that year. Statistics from his hockey career show he was active through the 1906\u201307 professional exhibition season with the [[Toronto Professional Hockey Club|Toronto Professionals]].\n\n==Family==\nHis younger brother was [[Ernie Liffiton]] who also played professional ice hockey. He is an ancestor of [[David Liffiton]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[New York Rangers]]. Around 1916, Charlie married Lena Margaret Clark. The couple had five children. It was also around 1916, that Charlie began his own business building automobile garages.\n\n==Stanley Cup engraving==\nWhile Charlie is a Stanley Cup champion, his name is not on the Cup. 1902 is one of the few years when only the teams name was engraved on the Cup, not each players.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.liffiton.net/artcharlie06/ \"One of the most famous of the Canadian hockey players\"] liffiton.net\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/1901/02/10/archives/canadians-victorious-allnew-york-hockey-team-beaten-easily-by-five.html \"C.

Corn syrup, also known as [[glucose syrup]] to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its [[glucose]] into [[fructose]] using the enzyme [[xylose isomerase|D-xylose isomerase]], thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.\n\nThe more general term [[glucose syrup]] is often used [[synonym]]ously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup in the [[United States]] is most commonly made from [[corn starch]].<ref>Structure of the world starch market, European Commission - Directorate Agricultural and Rural development, Evaluation of the Community Policy for Starch and Starch Products, Final report 2002, Chapter 1, page 3 [http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/eval/reports/amidon/chap1.pdf]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sugar.org/consumers/sweet_by_nature.asp?id=277 |title=Sugar Association Alternative Carbohydrate Sweeteners |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923020810/http://www.sugar.org/consumers/sweet_by_nature.asp?id=277 |archivedate=23 September 2006 }}</ref> Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch [[hydrolysis|hydrolysate]] of mono-, di-, and higher-[[saccharide]]s and can be made from any source of [[starch]]; [[wheat]], [[tapioca]] and [[potatoes]] are the most common other sources.<ref>[http://www.starch.dk/isi/starch/tm33www-wheat.htm Wheat starch, Application, International Starch Institute Denmark]</ref><ref>[http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/asia_cassava/pdf/proceedings_workshop_00/593.pdf Global casave outlook; Guy Henry, Andrew Westby; 2007; page 600] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405043608/http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/asia_cassava/pdf/proceedings_workshop_00/593.pdf |date=5 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starch.dk/isi/starch/glosary.htm |title=International Starch Association Starch and Glucose Glossary}}</ref>\n\n== Commercial preparation ==\nHistorically, corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute [[hydrochloric acid]], and then heating the mixture under pressure. The process was invented by the German chemist [[Gottlieb Kirchhoff]] in 1812. Currently, corn syrup is obtained through a multi-step [[bioprocess]]. First, the [[enzyme]] \u03b1-[[amylase]] is added to a mixture of corn starch and water. \u03b1-amylase is secreted by various species of the [[bacteria|bacterium]] genus ''[[Bacillus]]'' and the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria were grown. The enzyme breaks down the starch into [[oligosaccharide]]s, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme [[glucoamylase]], known also as \"\u03b3-amylase\". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus]]''; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme [[Xylose isomerase|D-xylose isomerase]], an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.<ref>Martin Chaplin and Christopher Bucke, ''Enzyme Technology'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990), pages 146-154.

All iPods have five buttons and the later generations (4th and above) have the buttons integrated into the click wheel&nbsp;\u2014 a design which gives an uncluttered, minimalist [[User Interface|interface]], though the circuitry contains multiple momentary button switches. The buttons are:\n*''Menu'': to traverse backward through the menus, toggle the [[backlight]] on older iPods, and jump to the main menu on newer iPods\n*''Center'': to select a menu item\n*''Play / Pause'': this doubles as an off switch when held\n*''Skip Forward / Fast Forward''\n*''Skip Backwards / Fast Reverse''\n\n===Operating system and firmware===\nThe iPod's operating system is stored on its dedicated storage medium. An additional NOR flash [[read-only memory|ROM]] chip (either 1&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] or 512&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]]) contains a [[bootloader]] program that tells the device to load its OS from the storage medium. Each iPod also has 32&nbsp;MB of [[random access memory|RAM]], although the 60GB and 80GB fifth generation, and the sixth-generation models have 64&nbsp;MB. A portion of the RAM is used to hold the iPod OS loaded from [[firmware]], but the majority of it serves to cache songs from the storage medium. For example, an iPod could spin its [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] up once and copy approximately 30&nbsp;MB of upcoming songs into RAM, thus saving power by not requiring the drive to spin up for each song. Custom firmware has also been developed such as [[Rockbox]] (up to 6G - 6G requires emCORE) and [[iPodLinux]] (up to 5G) which offer open-source alternatives to the standard firmware and operating system.\n\n===Additional features===\nIn March 2002, Apple added limited [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like functionality: text files can be displayed, while contacts and schedules can be viewed and synchronized with the host computer.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/mar/20ipod.html | title = Apple Introduces 10&nbsp;GB iPod\u20142,000 Songs in Your Pocket | publisher=[[Apple Inc]] | date = March 20, 2002 | accessdate =February 18, 2007 }}</ref>\nSome built-in [[iPod games|games]] are available, including ''Brick'' (a clone of [[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]), [[Parachute (iPod Game)|Parachute]], ''[[Solitaire]]'', and ''iPod Quiz''.

They went on sale on November 10, 2001. The first iPod had a monochrome  [[LCD]] (liquid-crystal display) screen and featured a 5GB hard drive capable of storing 1,000 songs encoded using MP3 and was priced at US$399. Among the iPod's innovations were its small size, achieved using a 1.8\" hard drive, whereas its competitors were using 2.5\" hard drives at the time, and its easy-to-use navigation, which was controlled using a mechanical scroll wheel (unlike later iPods, which had touch-sensitive scroll wheels), a center select button, and four auxiliary buttons around the wheel. The iPod had a rated battery life of ten hours.\n\nOn March 20, 2002, Apple introduced a 10GB model of the first-generation iPod for US$499. VCard compatibility was added, as well as allowing iPods to display business card information synced from a Mac.\n\n===2nd generation===\n[[Image:Ipod 2G.png|upright|thumb|left|iPod (2nd gen), 2002.]]\nThe second-generation of the iPod was introduced on July 17, 2002. Using a similar body style as the first generation, the top of the iPod was redesigned, switching from a single swooping cutout in the backplate to mount the FireWire port, hold switch and headphone assembly, to individual ports being cut into the backplate to allow these ports to be accessed. Furthermore, the hold switch was redesigned, a cover was added to the FireWire port, and the mechanical wheel was replaced with a touch-sensitive wheel. The second-generation class was available in 10GB for US$399 and 20GB for US$499. The first-generation 5GB iPod was carried over, but its price was reduced to US$299.\n\nNotably, the second-generation iPods and the updated first-generation iPod were now Windows-compatible. These versions came with a 4-pin to 6-pin [[FireWire]] adapter and were bundled with [[Musicmatch Jukebox]]. At that time [[iTunes]] was Mac only and unavailable for Windows.\n\nIn December 2002, Apple unveiled its first limited edition iPods, with either [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s, [[Tony Hawk]]'s, or [[Beck]]'s signature or [[No Doubt]]'s band logo engraved on the back for an extra US$50.<ref>Dalrymple, Jim.

Retrieved on January 7, 2007.</ref>\n\n===3rd generation===\n[[Image:3G ipod in dock.jpg|upright|thumb|right|iPod (3rd gen), 2003.]]\nOn April 29, 2003, Apple announced a completely redesigned third-generation iPod. Thinner than the previous models, the third-generation models replaced the [[FireWire]] port with a new Dock Connector  and introduced the Touch Wheel, a completely non-mechanical interface with the four auxiliary buttons located in a row between the screen and the touch wheel. The front plate had rounded edges, and the rear casing was slightly rounded as well. A new wired remote connector was introduced. Whereas first and second-generation iPods had an auxiliary ring around the headphone port for the remote, the third-generation iPods had a 4-pin jack adjacent to the headphone port. A 10GB model was sold for US$299, a 15GB model for US$399, and a 30GB model for US$499. All iPods were now compatible with Mac and Windows out of the box, was simply requiring Windows users to reformat the iPod before use on a PC and both iTunes and Musicmatch Jukebox were bundled with all iPods. The battery life was reduced to 8 hours, partially due to the use of a [[lithium-ion]] battery as opposed to a [[lithium polymer]] battery.\n\nThe 15GB model was replaced by a 20GB model and the 30GB model was upgraded to 40&nbsp;GB on September 8, 2003. The Windows-based Musicmatch Jukebox software was made obsolete and replaced by [[iTunes]] 4.1, the first version available for [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\n===4th generation===\n[[File:IPodphoto4G 1.png|upright|thumb|left|iPod (4th gen) iPod Photo, 2004.]]\nAnnounced on July 19, 2004, the fourth-generation iPod replaced the touch wheel from the third-generation iPod with the Click Wheel from the [[iPod Mini]], putting the four auxiliary buttons underneath a touch-sensitive scroll wheel. The casing was also slightly slimmer. Pricing was reduced and the lineup was simplified, as the 20GB model was sold for US$299 and the 40GB model for US$399. Notably, Apple began reducing pack-in accessories starting with the fourth generation. While a dock, carrying case, and wired remote were previously included with higher-end iPods, the higher-level 40GB iPod only came with a dock, earphones and an interchangeable proprietary cable capable of USB and FireWire interface. In addition to using the iPod Mini's Click Wheel, the fourth-generation iPod used the more energy-efficient components of the Mini, allowing the fourth-generation iPod to over 12 hours of battery life while using the same battery as its predecessor.\n\nA special [[U2]] edition was announced on October 26, 2004, to [[cross-marketing|cross-market]] U2's ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' album. The plastic front piece of the U2 edition iPod was black and the scroll wheel was red, [[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb#Promotion|to coincide with the color scheme of the U2 album]]. With 20&nbsp;GB and the signatures of all four members of U2, the special edition iPod was priced at US$349 and also included a US$50 coupon for a US$149 collection of U2's entire back catalog. U2 iPod customers also received 30 minutes of exclusive U2 video downloadable from the iTunes Music Store.\n\nA Special [[Harry Potter]] Edition was announced on September 7, 2005. It was released in conjunction with the Harry Potter Audiobooks in [[iTunes]].<ref>[https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/sep/07potter.html Harry Potter Digital Audiobooks Debut Exclusively on iTunes Music Store] Apple.com</ref> It had a [[Hogwarts]] logo engraved on the back, and all six Harry Potter audio books which were available at the time preloaded.\n\n====iPod Photo====\nOn October 26, 2004, in addition to the U2 edition, Apple also unveiled the iPod Photo. Positioned as a premium version of the standard fourth-generation iPod, the iPod Photo featured a 220\u00d7176 pixel LCD capable of displaying up to 65,536 colors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1027_3-5427237.html |title=Apple unveils color iPod, U2 edition |author=Ina Fried |author2=John Borland |work=CNET News.com |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> The device supported JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and PNG graphic file formats, and could be attached to a television or other external display for slideshows, thanks to a bundled TV cable.<ref name=\"PR041026\"/> Using iTunes 4.7, users could sync photos from a folder, from Apple's [[iPhoto]] on the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], [[Adobe Photoshop Album]] 2.0 or [[Photoshop Elements]] 3.0 on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"PR041026\">{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/oct/26ipodphoto.html | title=Apple Introduces iPod Photo | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | date=October 26, 2004 | accessdate=September 23, 2007}}</ref> Battery life was rated 15 hours for music playback and 5 hours for slideshows with music. The iPod Photo was available in a 40GB version for US$499 and a 60GB version for US$599.\n\nOn February 23, 2005, both 40GB models (photo and regular) were replaced with a slimmer and lower-priced (US$349) 30GB photo model leaving only a 20GB black-and-white iPod left. The price for the 60GB model was dropped to US$449 with fewer bundled accessories, making the dock, FireWire cable, and television cable extra-cost options. On the same day, Apple announced the iPod Camera Connector which allowed instant transfer of images from a USB-compatible [[digital camera]] to the iPod Photo.<ref name=\"PR050223\">{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/feb/23ipodphoto.html | title=Apple Updates iPod Photo Lineup | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | date=February 23, 2005 | accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> The main difference between this and [[Belkin]]'s Digital Camera Link was that Apple's unit supported instant image viewing on the iPod Photo after transfer without having to connect the iPod Photo to a computer first.\n\n====iPod with color display====\nOn June 28, 2005, just nine months after its introduction, the iPod Photo was merged with the rest of the iPod line.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/06/28Apple-Merges-iPod-iPod-photo-Lines.html |title=Apple Merges iPod & iPod photo Lines |publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]] |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref> The 30GB model was dropped, and the 20GB monochrome iPod received a color screen.

The fifth-generation iPod featured a 2.5\" 320\u00d7240 [[QVGA]] screen and a smaller Click Wheel. It was the first iPod to be able to play videos.\n\nThe fifth-generation iPod is the first iPod to be available in an alternative color scheme in a non-special-edition form, as a black option was added alongside \"Signature iPod White\", and marked the second full redesign of the iPod's aesthetic with its re-arranged proportions, its return to a fully flat front plate, and its more rounded rear casing. The 4-pin remote port was removed as well, causing backwards compatibility issues with certain accessories. A 30GB model was offered for US$299 and a 60GB model was offered for US$399. The fifth-generation iPod was also offered in the U2 special edition for US$349 with 30&nbsp;GB. The fifth-generation iPod was the last model to have a plastic face.\n\nThe fifth-generation iPod plays video in [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] (up to 2.5&nbsp;Mbit/s) and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (up to 768&nbsp;kbit/s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP41?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US|title=Fifth Generation iPod (iPod with video) 30 GB, 60 GB - Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Support|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> [[MPEG-4 AVC#Profiles|baseline profile]] only) formats.\nThe fifth-generation enhance iPod and or 1st revision plays video in [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] (up to 2.5&nbsp;Mbit/s) and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (up to 1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP26?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US|title=Fifth Generation iPod (Late 2006) - Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Support|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> [[MPEG-4 AVC#Profiles|baseline profile]] only) formats.

It is also possible to do this using some camcorder cables with an [[RCA connector|RCA connection]] at one end and a three-banded eighth-inch (3.5&nbsp;mm) A/V plug at the other, although the red and yellow plugs (normally the audio right and video signals respectively) must be swapped around in order to achieve the correct signal.\n\nThe fifth-generation iPod was updated on September 12, 2006, colloquially referred to as \"5.5th generation\". This update included a brighter screen, longer video playback time, newly designed earphones and a search feature. An iTunes installation CD was also no longer bundled, requiring users to download iTunes from Apple's website. The 60GB model was replaced with an 80GB model, and prices were cut by US$50 for both the 30GB (US$249) and the 80GB (US$349) models. Gapless playback and support for [[iPod games]] was enabled on all fifth-generation iPods through a firmware update released at the same time.\n\n===6th generation===\n[[Image:Ipodclassic80gb.jpg|thumb|right|iPod Classic 6, 2007.]]\n[[File:IPod classic 6G - with Rockbox firmware.jpeg|thumb|left|iPod classic 6th generation with Rockbox firmware]]\nDuring a special iPod-centric event on September 5, 2007, [[Steve Jobs]] introduced the sixth-generation iPod and the [[suffix]] \"classic\".

The front plate of the iPod is now made of [[anodized aluminium]] instead of [[polycarbonate]] plastic, and \"Signature iPod White\" has been replaced by silver. This marks the first time white is not available as a color option for an iPod. The sixth-generation iPod also introduced a completely overhauled user interface, incorporating more graphics and [[Cover Flow]]. The iPod Classic was offered in an 80GB model for MSRP US$249 and a 160GB model for MSRP US$349.\n\n====Revisions====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\nDuring the 'Let's Rock' Apple Event on September 9, 2008, the 80GB and the thicker 160GB model were discontinued in favor of a thin 120GB version retailing for US$249. It introduced Genius and audio recording capabilities which are also available in other iPod models released at similar times; no firmware update provides either feature to the first-generation iPods.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/apple-ipod-classic-second/4505-6490_7-33247504.html | title = Apple iPod classic review | work=CNet.com }}</ref> Also, the black model's faceplate was replaced with a gray colored faceplate, while retaining the silver backing and the black Click Wheel.\n\nPrior to the 'It's Only Rock and Roll' event on September 9, 2009, the price of the 120GB version was dropped to US$229. During the event, Apple replaced the 120GB version with an 160GB model, featuring the same slim profile which retailed at US$249.\n\n==Special Editions==\n'''U2 Special Editions'''\nThere are four different U2 Special Edition iPod models, each with widely differing capabilities. However, each of the U2 models\u2014the iPod U2 (4th Gen), iPod U2 (Color), iPod U2 (5th Gen/Video), and iPod U2 (5th Gen Enhanced) -- are the same internally as the \"standard\" iPod model available at the time, and the U2 models vary only in case design and cost.\n\n'''''The iPod U2 (4th Gen)'''''\n\nThe original U2 iPod\u2014the iPod U2 (4th Gen) -- is internally the same as the 20 GB configuration of the iPod (4th Generation), but uses a case with a black front, a red \"Clickwheel\", and laser-etched signatures of the U2 band members on the stainless steel back. It shipped with an \"exclusive\" U2 poster, a US$50-off coupon for \"The Complete U2\" downloadable \"box set\", and the standard white iPod earbuds. It cost US$50 more than the standard  iPod (4th Gen).\n\n'''''The iPod U2 (Color)'''''\n\nThe second U2 iPod\u2014the iPod U2 (Color) -- is internally identical to the 20 GB configuration of the iPod (with Color Display). It uses a slightly thicker (.06 inches) version of the original U2 iPod case complete with black front, red \"ClickWheel\", and laser etched signed stainless steel back, but most notably adds a color display. It also shipped with the same poster, coupon, and earbuds, but only cost US$30 more than the standard iPod (with Color Display).\n\n'''''The U2 (5th Gen & 5th Gen Enhanced)''''' \nThe third and fourth U2 Special Edition iPods\u2014the iPod U2 (5th Gen/Video), and iPod U2 (5th Gen Enhanced) -- are internally identical to the iPod Fifth Generation (with Video) and iPod Fifth Generation (Enhanced), respectively, but each cost US$30 more than the standard models. Externally, both have a red \"ClickWheel\" and a \"gloss black metal\" rear case (featuring laser-etched autographs of the U2 band members like the other U2 models).\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/ipod-faq/differences-between-u2-special-edition-ipods-and-standard-ipods.html|title=What are the differences between the U2 Special Edition iPod models and the standard iPod models?: EveryiPod.com|last=LLC|first=Kyle Media|website=everymac.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==Discontinuation==\n\nAccording to speculation by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', the 6th generation was, as of 2014, expected to be the final form of the iPod Classic that helped Apple achieve its success in the 2000s.<ref>{{Cite web  | last = Bonnington  | first = Christina  | title = Say Goodbye to the iPod Classic  | date = September 6, 2013  | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]  | url = https://www.wired.com/2013/09/goodbye-ipod-classic  | accessdate = September 10, 2014}}</ref> [[Ars Technica]] speculated in 2011 that the iPod Classic was nearing its end,<ref>{{Cite web  | last= Cheng  | first= Jacqui  | title = Why Apple is ready to kill off the iPod Classic  | website = [[Ars Technica]]  | url = https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/09/why-apple-is-ready-to-kill-off-the-ipod-classic/  | accessdate = September 11, 2014}}</ref> and the site's readers generally agreed it would not still be produced in 2013.<ref name=arstechnica-2014-09-09>{{Cite web  | last = Johnston  | first = Casey  | title = iPod classic is dead, and the 30-pin connector along with it  | date = September 9, 2014  | website = [[Ars Technica]]  | url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/ipod-classic-is-dead-and-the-30-pin-connector-along-with-it/  | accessdate = September 11, 2014}}</ref> The [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] in 2013 revealed no new iPod Classic and Apple was not expected to produce another one.

and marketed as '''iPod classic''' and formerly just '''iPod''') is a [[portable media player]] created and formerly marketed by [[Apple Inc.]]\n\nThere were six generations of the iPod Classic, as well as a spin-off (the iPod Photo) that was later re-integrated into the main iPod line. All generations used a {{convert|1.8|in|mm|adj=on}} [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] for storage. The \"classic\" suffix was formally introduced with the rollout of the sixth-generation iPod on September 5, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |author=Apple Computer, Inc. |url=http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a |title=Apple \u2013 QuickTime \u2013 September 2007 Keynote Address |publisher=Events.apple.com.edgesuite.net |date=March 26, 1999 |accessdate=October 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001208/http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Prior to this, all iPod Classic models were simply referred to as iPods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353 |title=Apple Support Article \u2013 Identifying iPod Models |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref> It was available in silver or black replacing the \"signature iPod white\".\n\nOn September 9, 2014, Apple discontinued the iPod Classic.<ref name=\"discontinued\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ipod-classic-retired-fans-mourn-as-apple-quietly-kills-off-iconic-gadget-9724939.html |title= iPod Classic retired: Fans mourn as Apple quietly kills off its most iconic gadget |publisher= The Independent |date= 11 September 2014 |accessdate= 11 September 2014 }}</ref> The sixth-generation 160GB iPod Classic was the last Apple product in the iPod line to use the original [[Dock connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|30-pin dock connector]] and the iconic [[iPod click wheel|Click Wheel]].<ref name=arstechnica-2014-09-09/><ref name=digitaltrends-clickwheel/>\n\n==Technical information==\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:iPod wheel.svg|thumb|The iPod's signature Click Wheel.]]\niPods with color displays use [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]] graphics and text, with sliding animations. All iPods have five buttons and the later generations (4th and above) have the buttons integrated into the click wheel&nbsp;\u2014 a design which gives an uncluttered, minimalist [[User Interface|interface]], though the circuitry contains multiple momentary button switches. The buttons are:\n*''Menu'': to traverse backward through the menus, toggle the [[backlight]] on older iPods, and jump to the main menu on newer iPods\n*''Center'': to select a menu item\n*''Play / Pause'': this doubles as an off switch when held\n*''Skip Forward / Fast Forward''\n*''Skip Backwards / Fast Reverse''\n\n===Operating system and firmware===\nThe iPod's operating system is stored on its dedicated storage medium. An additional NOR flash [[read-only memory|ROM]] chip (either 1&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] or 512&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]]) contains a [[bootloader]] program that tells the device to load its OS from the storage medium. Each iPod also has 32&nbsp;MB of [[random access memory|RAM]], although the 60GB and 80GB fifth generation, and the sixth-generation models have 64&nbsp;MB. A portion of the RAM is used to hold the iPod OS loaded from [[firmware]], but the majority of it serves to cache songs from the storage medium. For example, an iPod could spin its [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] up once and copy approximately 30&nbsp;MB of upcoming songs into RAM, thus saving power by not requiring the drive to spin up for each song. Custom firmware has also been developed such as [[Rockbox]] (up to 6G - 6G requires emCORE) and [[iPodLinux]] (up to 5G) which offer open-source alternatives to the standard firmware and operating system.\n\n===Additional features===\nIn March 2002, Apple added limited [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like functionality: text files can be displayed, while contacts and schedules can be viewed and synchronized with the host computer.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/mar/20ipod.html | title = Apple Introduces 10&nbsp;GB iPod\u20142,000 Songs in Your Pocket | publisher=[[Apple Inc]] | date = March 20, 2002 | accessdate =February 18, 2007 }}</ref>\nSome built-in [[iPod games|games]] are available, including ''Brick'' (a clone of [[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]), [[Parachute (iPod Game)|Parachute]], ''[[Solitaire]]'', and ''iPod Quiz''. A firmware update released in September 2006 brought some extra features to fifth-generation iPods including adjustable screen brightness, [[gapless playback]], and downloadable games. However, as of September 30, 2011, these games are no longer available on the iTunes Store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/30/apple_removes_ipod_classic_click_wheel_games_from_itunes_store.html |title=Apple removes click-wheel games from iTunes as iPod classic lives its last days |publisher=AppleInsider |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n==={{anchor|Original iPod}}1st generation=== <!-- Please retain anchor used in [[Original iPod]] -->\n[[Image:Lightmatter ipod 1G.jpg|upright|thumb|left|iPod (1st gen), 2001.]]\nApple introduced the first-generation iPod (M8541) on October 23, 2001, with the slogan \"1,000 songs in your pocket\". They went on sale on November 10, 2001. The first iPod had a monochrome  [[LCD]] (liquid-crystal display) screen and featured a 5GB hard drive capable of storing 1,000 songs encoded using MP3 and was priced at US$399. Among the iPod's innovations were its small size, achieved using a 1.8\" hard drive, whereas its competitors were using 2.5\" hard drives at the time, and its easy-to-use navigation, which was controlled using a mechanical scroll wheel (unlike later iPods, which had touch-sensitive scroll wheels), a center select button, and four auxiliary buttons around the wheel. The iPod had a rated battery life of ten hours.\n\nOn March 20, 2002, Apple introduced a 10GB model of the first-generation iPod for US$499. VCard compatibility was added, as well as allowing iPods to display business card information synced from a Mac.\n\n===2nd generation===\n[[Image:Ipod 2G.png|upright|thumb|left|iPod (2nd gen), 2002.]]\nThe second-generation of the iPod was introduced on July 17, 2002. Using a similar body style as the first generation, the top of the iPod was redesigned, switching from a single swooping cutout in the backplate to mount the FireWire port, hold switch and headphone assembly, to individual ports being cut into the backplate to allow these ports to be accessed. Furthermore, the hold switch was redesigned, a cover was added to the FireWire port, and the mechanical wheel was replaced with a touch-sensitive wheel. The second-generation class was available in 10GB for US$399 and 20GB for US$499. The first-generation 5GB iPod was carried over, but its price was reduced to US$299.\n\nNotably, the second-generation iPods and the updated first-generation iPod were now Windows-compatible. These versions came with a 4-pin to 6-pin [[FireWire]] adapter and were bundled with [[Musicmatch Jukebox]]. At that time [[iTunes]] was Mac only and unavailable for Windows.\n\nIn December 2002, Apple unveiled its first limited edition iPods, with either [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s, [[Tony Hawk]]'s, or [[Beck]]'s signature or [[No Doubt]]'s band logo engraved on the back for an extra US$50.<ref>Dalrymple, Jim. [http://www.macworld.com/news/2002/12/10/ipod/index.php Limited Edition Madonna, Tony Hawk, Beck iPods]. ''[[Macworld]]'', September 10, 2002. Retrieved on January 7, 2007.</ref>\n\n===3rd generation===\n[[Image:3G ipod in dock.jpg|upright|thumb|right|iPod (3rd gen), 2003.]]\nOn April 29, 2003, Apple announced a completely redesigned third-generation iPod. Thinner than the previous models, the third-generation models replaced the [[FireWire]] port with a new Dock Connector  and introduced the Touch Wheel, a completely non-mechanical interface with the four auxiliary buttons located in a row between the screen and the touch wheel. The front plate had rounded edges, and the rear casing was slightly rounded as well. A new wired remote connector was introduced. Whereas first and second-generation iPods had an auxiliary ring around the headphone port for the remote, the third-generation iPods had a 4-pin jack adjacent to the headphone port. A 10GB model was sold for US$299, a 15GB model for US$399, and a 30GB model for US$499. All iPods were now compatible with Mac and Windows out of the box, was simply requiring Windows users to reformat the iPod before use on a PC and both iTunes and Musicmatch Jukebox were bundled with all iPods. The battery life was reduced to 8 hours, partially due to the use of a [[lithium-ion]] battery as opposed to a [[lithium polymer]] battery.\n\nThe 15GB model was replaced by a 20GB model and the 30GB model was upgraded to 40&nbsp;GB on September 8, 2003. The Windows-based Musicmatch Jukebox software was made obsolete and replaced by [[iTunes]] 4.1, the first version available for [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\n===4th generation===\n[[File:IPodphoto4G 1.png|upright|thumb|left|iPod (4th gen) iPod Photo, 2004.]]\nAnnounced on July 19, 2004, the fourth-generation iPod replaced the touch wheel from the third-generation iPod with the Click Wheel from the [[iPod Mini]], putting the four auxiliary buttons underneath a touch-sensitive scroll wheel. The casing was also slightly slimmer. Pricing was reduced and the lineup was simplified, as the 20GB model was sold for US$299 and the 40GB model for US$399. Notably, Apple began reducing pack-in accessories starting with the fourth generation. While a dock, carrying case, and wired remote were previously included with higher-end iPods, the higher-level 40GB iPod only came with a dock, earphones and an interchangeable proprietary cable capable of USB and FireWire interface. In addition to using the iPod Mini's Click Wheel, the fourth-generation iPod used the more energy-efficient components of the Mini, allowing the fourth-generation iPod to over 12 hours of battery life while using the same battery as its predecessor.\n\nA special [[U2]] edition was announced on October 26, 2004, to [[cross-marketing|cross-market]] U2's ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' album. The plastic front piece of the U2 edition iPod was black and the scroll wheel was red, [[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb#Promotion|to coincide with the color scheme of the U2 album]]. With 20&nbsp;GB and the signatures of all four members of U2, the special edition iPod was priced at US$349 and also included a US$50 coupon for a US$149 collection of U2's entire back catalog. U2 iPod customers also received 30 minutes of exclusive U2 video downloadable from the iTunes Music Store.\n\nA Special [[Harry Potter]] Edition was announced on September 7, 2005. It was released in conjunction with the Harry Potter Audiobooks in [[iTunes]].<ref>[https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/sep/07potter.html Harry Potter Digital Audiobooks Debut Exclusively on iTunes Music Store] Apple.com</ref> It had a [[Hogwarts]] logo engraved on the back, and all six Harry Potter audio books which were available at the time preloaded.\n\n====iPod Photo====\nOn October 26, 2004, in addition to the U2 edition, Apple also unveiled the iPod Photo. Positioned as a premium version of the standard fourth-generation iPod, the iPod Photo featured a 220\u00d7176 pixel LCD capable of displaying up to 65,536 colors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1027_3-5427237.html |title=Apple unveils color iPod, U2 edition |author=Ina Fried |author2=John Borland |work=CNET News.com |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> The device supported JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and PNG graphic file formats, and could be attached to a television or other external display for slideshows, thanks to a bundled TV cable.<ref name=\"PR041026\"/> Using iTunes 4.7, users could sync photos from a folder, from Apple's [[iPhoto]] on the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], [[Adobe Photoshop Album]] 2.0 or [[Photoshop Elements]] 3.0 on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"PR041026\">{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/oct/26ipodphoto.html | title=Apple Introduces iPod Photo | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | date=October 26, 2004 | accessdate=September 23, 2007}}</ref> Battery life was rated 15 hours for music playback and 5 hours for slideshows with music. The iPod Photo was available in a 40GB version for US$499 and a 60GB version for US$599.\n\nOn February 23, 2005, both 40GB models (photo and regular) were replaced with a slimmer and lower-priced (US$349) 30GB photo model leaving only a 20GB black-and-white iPod left. The price for the 60GB model was dropped to US$449 with fewer bundled accessories, making the dock, FireWire cable, and television cable extra-cost options. On the same day, Apple announced the iPod Camera Connector which allowed instant transfer of images from a USB-compatible [[digital camera]] to the iPod Photo.<ref name=\"PR050223\">{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/feb/23ipodphoto.html | title=Apple Updates iPod Photo Lineup | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | date=February 23, 2005 | accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> The main difference between this and [[Belkin]]'s Digital Camera Link was that Apple's unit supported instant image viewing on the iPod Photo after transfer without having to connect the iPod Photo to a computer first.\n\n====iPod with color display====\nOn June 28, 2005, just nine months after its introduction, the iPod Photo was merged with the rest of the iPod line.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/06/28Apple-Merges-iPod-iPod-photo-Lines.html |title=Apple Merges iPod & iPod photo Lines |publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]] |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref> The 30GB model was dropped, and the 20GB monochrome iPod received a color screen.

The fifth-generation iPod featured a 2.5\" 320\u00d7240 [[QVGA]] screen and a smaller Click Wheel. It was the first iPod to be able to play videos.\n\nThe fifth-generation iPod is the first iPod to be available in an alternative color scheme in a non-special-edition form, as a black option was added alongside \"Signature iPod White\", and marked the second full redesign of the iPod's aesthetic with its re-arranged proportions, its return to a fully flat front plate, and its more rounded rear casing. The 4-pin remote port was removed as well, causing backwards compatibility issues with certain accessories. A 30GB model was offered for US$299 and a 60GB model was offered for US$399. The fifth-generation iPod was also offered in the U2 special edition for US$349 with 30&nbsp;GB. The fifth-generation iPod was the last model to have a plastic face.\n\nThe fifth-generation iPod plays video in [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] (up to 2.5&nbsp;Mbit/s) and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (up to 768&nbsp;kbit/s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP41?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US|title=Fifth Generation iPod (iPod with video) 30 GB, 60 GB - Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Support|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> [[MPEG-4 AVC#Profiles|baseline profile]] only) formats.\nThe fifth-generation enhance iPod and or 1st revision plays video in [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] (up to 2.5&nbsp;Mbit/s) and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (up to 1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP26?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US|title=Fifth Generation iPod (Late 2006) - Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Support|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> [[MPEG-4 AVC#Profiles|baseline profile]] only) formats. Video such as TV shows, podcasts, music videos, and movies may be purchased from online stores such as the iTunes Store, or downloaded from Google Video and other sources, then imported to the iPod via iTunes software.\n\nVideos or photo slideshows may be played from the fifth-generation iPod on a television set, projector or monitor with the use of the Apple iPod AV cable or via a dock using an S-Video cable. It is also possible to do this using some camcorder cables with an [[RCA connector|RCA connection]] at one end and a three-banded eighth-inch (3.5&nbsp;mm) A/V plug at the other, although the red and yellow plugs (normally the audio right and video signals respectively) must be swapped around in order to achieve the correct signal.\n\nThe fifth-generation iPod was updated on September 12, 2006, colloquially referred to as \"5.5th generation\". This update included a brighter screen, longer video playback time, newly designed earphones and a search feature. An iTunes installation CD was also no longer bundled, requiring users to download iTunes from Apple's website. The 60GB model was replaced with an 80GB model, and prices were cut by US$50 for both the 30GB (US$249) and the 80GB (US$349) models. Gapless playback and support for [[iPod games]] was enabled on all fifth-generation iPods through a firmware update released at the same time.\n\n===6th generation===\n[[Image:Ipodclassic80gb.jpg|thumb|right|iPod Classic 6, 2007.]]\n[[File:IPod classic 6G - with Rockbox firmware.jpeg|thumb|left|iPod classic 6th generation with Rockbox firmware]]\nDuring a special iPod-centric event on September 5, 2007, [[Steve Jobs]] introduced the sixth-generation iPod and the [[suffix]] \"classic\". Featuring slightly thinner bodies, the sixth-generation iPod also had dramatically improved battery life, claiming up to 36 hours of music playback and 6 hours of video playback.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/specs.html |title=Apple \u2013 iPod classic \u2013 Read the iPod classic technical specifications |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref> The iPod Classic has a 2.5\" backlit display at a resolution of 320\u00d7240. The front plate of the iPod is now made of [[anodized aluminium]] instead of [[polycarbonate]] plastic, and \"Signature iPod White\" has been replaced by silver. This marks the first time white is not available as a color option for an iPod. The sixth-generation iPod also introduced a completely overhauled user interface, incorporating more graphics and [[Cover Flow]]. The iPod Classic was offered in an 80GB model for MSRP US$249 and a 160GB model for MSRP US$349.\n\n====Revisions====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\nDuring the 'Let's Rock' Apple Event on September 9, 2008, the 80GB and the thicker 160GB model were discontinued in favor of a thin 120GB version retailing for US$249. It introduced Genius and audio recording capabilities which are also available in other iPod models released at similar times; no firmware update provides either feature to the first-generation iPods.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/apple-ipod-classic-second/4505-6490_7-33247504.html | title = Apple iPod classic review | work=CNet.com }}</ref> Also, the black model's faceplate was replaced with a gray colored faceplate, while retaining the silver backing and the black Click Wheel.\n\nPrior to the 'It's Only Rock and Roll' event on September 9, 2009, the price of the 120GB version was dropped to US$229. During the event, Apple replaced the 120GB version with an 160GB model, featuring the same slim profile which retailed at US$249.\n\n==Special Editions==\n'''U2 Special Editions'''\nThere are four different U2 Special Edition iPod models, each with widely differing capabilities. However, each of the U2 models\u2014the iPod U2 (4th Gen), iPod U2 (Color), iPod U2 (5th Gen/Video), and iPod U2 (5th Gen Enhanced) -- are the same internally as the \"standard\" iPod model available at the time, and the U2 models vary only in case design and cost.\n\n'''''The iPod U2 (4th Gen)'''''\n\nThe original U2 iPod\u2014the iPod U2 (4th Gen) -- is internally the same as the 20 GB configuration of the iPod (4th Generation), but uses a case with a black front, a red \"Clickwheel\", and laser-etched signatures of the U2 band members on the stainless steel back. It shipped with an \"exclusive\" U2 poster, a US$50-off coupon for \"The Complete U2\" downloadable \"box set\", and the standard white iPod earbuds. It cost US$50 more than the standard  iPod (4th Gen).\n\n'''''The iPod U2 (Color)'''''\n\nThe second U2 iPod\u2014the iPod U2 (Color) -- is internally identical to the 20 GB configuration of the iPod (with Color Display). It uses a slightly thicker (.06 inches) version of the original U2 iPod case complete with black front, red \"ClickWheel\", and laser etched signed stainless steel back, but most notably adds a color display. It also shipped with the same poster, coupon, and earbuds, but only cost US$30 more than the standard iPod (with Color Display).\n\n'''''The U2 (5th Gen & 5th Gen Enhanced)''''' \nThe third and fourth U2 Special Edition iPods\u2014the iPod U2 (5th Gen/Video), and iPod U2 (5th Gen Enhanced) -- are internally identical to the iPod Fifth Generation (with Video) and iPod Fifth Generation (Enhanced), respectively, but each cost US$30 more than the standard models. Externally, both have a red \"ClickWheel\" and a \"gloss black metal\" rear case (featuring laser-etched autographs of the U2 band members like the other U2 models).\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/ipod-faq/differences-between-u2-special-edition-ipods-and-standard-ipods.html|title=What are the differences between the U2 Special Edition iPod models and the standard iPod models?: EveryiPod.com|last=LLC|first=Kyle Media|website=everymac.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==Discontinuation==\n\nAccording to speculation by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', the 6th generation was, as of 2014, expected to be the final form of the iPod Classic that helped Apple achieve its success in the 2000s.<ref>{{Cite web  | last = Bonnington  | first = Christina  | title = Say Goodbye to the iPod Classic  | date = September 6, 2013  | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]  | url = https://www.wired.com/2013/09/goodbye-ipod-classic  | accessdate = September 10, 2014}}</ref> [[Ars Technica]] speculated in 2011 that the iPod Classic was nearing its end,<ref>{{Cite web  | last= Cheng  | first= Jacqui  | title = Why Apple is ready to kill off the iPod Classic  | website = [[Ars Technica]]  | url = https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/09/why-apple-is-ready-to-kill-off-the-ipod-classic/  | accessdate = September 11, 2014}}</ref> and the site's readers generally agreed it would not still be produced in 2013.<ref name=arstechnica-2014-09-09>{{Cite web  | last = Johnston  | first = Casey  | title = iPod classic is dead, and the 30-pin connector along with it  | date = September 9, 2014  | website = [[Ars Technica]]  | url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/ipod-classic-is-dead-and-the-30-pin-connector-along-with-it/  | accessdate = September 11, 2014}}</ref> The [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] in 2013 revealed no new iPod Classic and Apple was not expected to produce another one.

and later the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) party and jurist.\n\nBoertien attended a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Zwolle]] from April 1939 until May 1946 and applied at the [[Utrecht University]] in June 1946 [[Major (academic)|majoring]] in [[Law]] and obtaining an [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in July 1948 and worked as [[Research|student researcher]] before graduating with an [[Master of Laws]] degree on 13 December 1952. Boertien worked as a office clerk for a printing office in Zwolle from June 1946 until August 1947 and for a insurance company in [[Utrecht]] from August 1947 until December 1952. Boertien worked as a accountant for the [[:nl:Nederlands Instituut van Registeraccountants|Institute of Registered Accountants]] from December 1952 until September 1960. Boertien worked as a [[paralegal]] for [[Philips]] in [[Eindhoven]] from September 1960 until October 1965. Boertien applied at the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|Free University Amsterdam]] in July 1958 for a [[postgraduate education]] in Law and worked as a researcher at the Free University Amsterdam before he got an [[doctorate]] as an [[Doctor of Law]] on 13 April 1962. Boertien served on the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party#Leadership|Anti-Revolutionary Party Executive Board]] from February 1960 until May 1965.\n\nBoertien became a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] after [[Jan Smallenbroek]] was appointed as [[List of Ministers of the Interior of the Netherlands|Minister of the Interior]] in the [[Cals cabinet|Cabinet Cals]] following the [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation of 1965]], taking office on 18 May 1965 serving as a [[frontbencher]] and [[spokesperson]] for [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Justice]], [[Law enforcement in the Netherlands|Law enforcement]], [[Ministry of Transport and Water Management (Netherlands)|Transport]], [[PostNL|Postal Services]], [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport|Medical Ethics]], [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Gambling]] and deputy spokesperson for [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment|Social Affairs]] and the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Royal Family]]. Boertien was selected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] and [[Dual mandate|dual served]] in those positions, taking office on 8 May 1967. After the [[1971 Dutch general election|election of 1971]] Boertien was appointed as [[Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation (Netherlands)|Minister for Development Cooperation]] in the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet|Cabinet Biesheuvel I]], taking office on 14 July 1971. The Cabinet Biesheuvel I fell just one year later on 19 July 1972 after the [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS'70) retracted their support following there dissatisfaction with the proposed [[Budget Memorandum (Netherlands)|budget memorandum]] to further [[Government budget balance|reduce the deficit]] and continued to serve in a [[Demissionary cabinet|demissionary]] capacity until the [[Dutch cabinet formation|first cabinet formation of 1972]] when it was replaced by the [[caretaker government|caretaker]] [[Second Biesheuvel cabinet|Cabinet Biesheuvel II]] with Boertien continuing as Minister for Development Cooperation, taking office on 9 August 1972. After the [[1972 Dutch general election|election of 1972]] Boertien returned as a Member of the House of Representatives, taking office on 7 December 1972 but he was still serving in the cabinet and because of [[Dualism (politics)|dualism]] customs in the [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] of Dutch politics he couldn't serve a [[dual mandate]] he subsequently resigned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 7 March 1973. Following the [[Dutch cabinet formation|second cabinet formation of 1972]] Boertien was not giving a cabinet post in the new [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]], the Cabinet Biesheuvel II was replaced by the [[Den Uyl cabinet|Cabinet Den Uyl]] on 11 May 1973. Boertien subsequently returned as a Member of the House of Representatives after [[Antoon Veerman]] was appointment as [[List of Ministers of Education of the Netherlands#List of State Secretaries for Education|State Secretary for Education and Sciences]] in the new [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]], taking office on 28 May 1973 serving as a frontbencher chairing the [[:nl:Tweede Kamercommissie|parliamentary committee for Kingdom Relations]] and the [[:nl:Tweede Kamercommissie|special parliamentary committee for European Parliamentary Reforms]] and spokesperson for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Foreign Affairs]], [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Defence]], [[European Union|European Affairs]], [[Benelux|Benelux Union]] and deputy spokesperson for Medical Ethics and [[Abortion]]. \n\nIn December 1974 Boertien was nominated as [[King's commissioner|Queen's Commissioner]] of [[Zeeland]], he resigned as Member of the House of Representatives the same day he was installed as Queen's Commissioner, serving from 16 January 1975 until 1 August 1992. Boertien also became active in the [[private sector]] and [[public sector]] and occupied numerous seats as a corporate director and nonprofit director on several boards of directors and supervisory boards and served on several [[:nl:Staatscommissie|state commissions]] and councils on behalf of the government ([[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Advisory Council for Spatial Planning]], [[:nl:Raad voor Cultuur|Council for Culture]], [[:nl:Kadaster|Cadastre Agency]] and the [[Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn|Public Pension Funds PFZW]]).\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Honours'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!

During the next millennia it transformed the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] using specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food. Other developments that are found very widely during this era are the [[Domestication of animals]], [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.\n\nThese developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and greater [[property]] ownership.

However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.<ref>Scarre, Chris (2005). \u201cThe World Transformed: From Foragers and Farmers to States and Empires\u201d in \u201cThe Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies\u201d (Ed: Chris Scarre).

Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and, therefore quite valuable. The animal\u2019s ability as a worker (for example, ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included [[Origin of the domestic dog|dogs]] ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),<ref>{{Cite news\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2498669.stm\n| title = Origin of dogs traced\n| accessdate = 2006-11-29\n| last = McGourty\n| first = Christine\n| date = 2002-11-22\n| publisher = BBC News\n}}</ref> sheep, goats, cows, and pigs.\n\n===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===\n[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]\n\nThe Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats, and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1966\"/><ref>Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Pr\u00e9histoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.</ref> The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that later helped distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.<ref>\u201d [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies\u201d.

The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.<ref name=\"SandsMorris2009\">{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377\u2013389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}</ref><ref name=\"OKeefeCordain2004\">{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101\u2013108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}</ref><ref name=\"Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250\">{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |url=https://archive.org/details/borderlandsofsci00mic_hoo |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/borderlandsofsci00mic_hoo/page/250 250]}}</ref> Average height went down from 5'10\" (178&nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6\" (168&nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5\" (165&nbsp;cm) and 5'1\" (155&nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175\u2013178 |date=July\u2013September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor.

Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.<ref name=\u201d Sherratt 1981\u201d>Sherratt 1981</ref> The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided several other useful products. These included:\n* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]\n* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)\n* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)\n* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses, and camels)\n* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels, and dogs)\n* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)\n\nSherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for agriculture. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi-arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the Domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].<ref name=\u201d Sherratt 1981\u201d/> Overgrazing of these areas, mainly by herds of goats, significantly extended the areal extent of deserts.\n\nLiving in one spot permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, and prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society could diversify into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. Also, the denser populations could form and support the legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time, property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n===Disease===\n\nThroughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population.

Most hunter-gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.\n\nThe process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.\n[[File:Genetic analysis on the spread of barley from 9000 to 2000 BCE.jpg|thumb|Genetic analysis on the spread of barley from 9,000 to 2,000 BP<ref name=\"BHE\"/>]]\n\n===Spread of crops: the case of barley===\n{{main|Barley}}\nOne of the world\u2019s most important crops, [[barley]], was domesticated in the Near East around 11,000 years ago (c. 9,000 BCE).<ref name=\"BHE\"/> Barley is a highly resilient crop, able to grown in varied and marginal environments, such as in regions of high altitude and latitude.<ref name=\"BHE\"/> Archaeobotanical evidence shows that barley had spread throughout Eurasia by 2,000 BCE.<ref name=\"BHE\"/> To further elucidate the routes by which barley cultivation was spread through Eurasia, genetic analysis was used to determine genetic diversity and population structure in extant barley taxa.<ref name=\"BHE\"/> Genetic analysis shows that cultivated barley spread through Eurasia via several different routes, which were most likely separated in both time and space.<ref name=\"BHE\">[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Martin K. |last2=Kovaleva |first2=Olga |title=Barley heads east: Genetic analyses reveal routes of spread through diverse Eurasian landscapes |journal=PLOS One |date=18 July 2018 |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=e0196652 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0196652 |pmid=30020920 |pmc=6051582 |language=en |issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2018PLoSO..1396652L }}</ref>\n\n==Development and diffusion==\n===Beginnings in the Levant===\n{{main|Pre-Pottery Neolithic|Pottery Neolithic}}\n[[File:Asikli Hoyuk sarah c murray 6176.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|The Neolithic is characterized by fixed human settlements and the [[invention of agriculture]] from c. 10,000 BP.

Remains of food-producing societies in the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] have been carbon-dated to around 6500 BCE at [[Knossos]], [[Franchthi Cave]], and a number of mainland sites in [[Thessaly]]. Neolithic groups appear soon afterwards in the [[Balkans]] and south-central Europe. The Neolithic cultures of [[southeastern Europe]] (the [[Balkans]] and the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]) show some continuity with groups in southwest Asia and [[Anatolia]] (e.g., [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]]).\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain [[pottery|ceramics]], and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: [[einkorn]], [[emmer]], [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[pig]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[cattle]]. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia.{{sfn|Bellwood|2004|pp=68\u201369}} The only domesticate not from Southwest Asia was [[broomcorn millet]], domesticated in East Asia.{{sfn|Bellwood|2004|pp=74, 118}}The earliest evidence of [[cheese]]-making dates to 5500 BCE in [[Kujawy]], [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/art-of-cheese-making-is-7-500-years-old-1.12020 |title=Art of cheese-making is 7,500 years old |journal=Nature News |first=Nidhi |last=Subbaraman |date=December 12, 2012 |doi=10.1038/nature.2012.12020}}</ref>\n\nThe diffusion across Europe, from the Aegean to Britain, took about 2,500 years (6500\u20134000 BP).

The animal\u2019s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account.

He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1966\"/><ref>Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Pr\u00e9histoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.</ref> The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that later helped distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.<ref>''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''.

Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,\nmostly diseases and warfare.<ref>[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ: Yale UP, (2017), \"The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million.

The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers.

Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.<ref name=\"Sherratt 1981\">Sherratt 1981</ref> The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:\n* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]\n* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)\n* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)\n* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses, and camels)\n* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels, and dogs)\n* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)\n\nSherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].<ref name=\"Sherratt 1981\"/> Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.\n\nLiving in one spot permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society could diversify into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n===Disease===\n\nThroughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed.
