Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis of maharashtra played an important role from pre-maratha time.

By the year 1734, Kolis of Gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They were well known for their infamous activities at sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked Koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of Koli pirates after six months, and ten more vessels were fired by British. Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time. It seems that ''Koli Piracy'' was a headache for all naval powers of India.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saletore|first=Rajaram Narayan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&dq=Koli+Pirate&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Indian Pirates|date=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrincely states of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] and [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] also suffered Koli piracy.

During the time of [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Akherajji Bhavsinhji [[Gohil]], [[Talaja]] was a stronghold of the Koli pirates. Texts state that Koli pirates were the most daring and out of control of the [[Princely state|Princely States]] because Thakur of [[Bhavnagar]] was unable to put down the piracy of Kolis. As a result, in 1771, the state of Bhavnagar sought the help from [[Junagadh State]] and allied with the [[British Raj|British Government]] to suppress Koli pirates and the combined forces of the Bhavnagar Army, Junagadh Army and British captured Talaja from the Kolis.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pfeffer|first=Georg|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=R--XMUsk7sIC&pg=PA199&dq=Koli+Pirate&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFw7bKq8voAhWa7HMBHUpBDg4Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Pirate&f=false|title=Contemporary Society: Concept of tribal society|last2=Behera|first2=Deepak Kumar|date=1997|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-983-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=John Whaley|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KFwoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA27&dq=Kolis+Pirate&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV1aey7MvoAhUOzDgGHb2JAjAQ6AEITjAH#v=onepage&q=Kolis%20Pirate&f=false|title=Statistical Account of Bh\u00e1vnagar: Being the Bh\u00e1vnagar Contribution to the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Portion of the Bombay Gazetteer|date=1878|publisher=Printed at the Education Society's Press|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1780 to 1790, Kolis of [[Rajapur, Maharashtra|Rajapur]] and [[Jafarabad State|Jafrabad]] engaged in capturing vessels in [[Daman and Diu]], [[Surat]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]], which was a big danger for travellers and posed a threat to maritime activity in the [[Indian Ocean|Western Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Machado|first=Pedro|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ODfJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=Kolis+Pirate&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj8Y6n5MvoAhWqH7cAHRnjDEIQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&q=Kolis%20Pirate&f=false|title=Ocean of Trade|date=2014-11-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-07026-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Nadri|first=Ghulam A.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=En_heITTXCoC&dq=Rajapur+Kolis+Pirates&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Eighteenth-Century Gujarat: The Dynamics of Its Political Economy, 1750-1800|date=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17202-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency]] mentions the Koli pirates of ''Sultanpur'' in [[Kathiawar]] of Gujarat.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis of maharashtra played an important role from pre-maratha time.

The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked at koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of koli pirates after six months, their ten more vessels were fired by british. But it explains that koli pirates were notorious and challenge for maritime powers. At 21st January 1739, koli pirates with [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] capturef several british vessels among which was '''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After few years in 1749, koli pirates captured the '<nowiki/>''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>' carrying sixty thousand cash and [[Cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for british government. After that ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against koli pirates in 1750 and there was a fight at ''Kurla River'' and defeated the kolis and captured 23 armed vessels. After this fight, kolis silenced for long time.

{"title_page": "History of Uganda", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=May 2011}}\n{{History of Uganda}}\nThe '''history of Uganda''' comprises the history of the people who inhabited the territory of present-day [[Uganda]] before the establishment of the Republic of Uganda, and the history of that country once it was established. Evidence from the [[Paleolithic]] era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and in 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1986 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed. [http://countrystudies.us/uganda/ Uganda: A Country Study]. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990. p. 4</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, by the first century CE and possibly as early as the fourth century BCE in Western Tanzania, certain related Bantu-speaking metallurgists were perfecting iron smelting to produce medium grade [[carbon steel]] in pre-heated forced-draught furnaces. Although most of these developments were taking place southwest of modern Ugandan boundaries, iron was mined and smelted in many parts of the country not long afterward.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\"/>\n\n== Uganda Protectorate (1894\u20131962) ==  \n{{Further|Uganda Protectorate}}\n\nIn the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|recruited to East Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to construct the [[Uganda Railway]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/762515.stm | title=Kenya's Asian heritage on display | publisher=[[BBC]] | last=Evans | first=Ruth | date=24 May 2000 | access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | title=THE LUNATIC EXPRESS \u2013 A PHOTO ESSAY ON THE UGANDA RAILWAY. | publisher=[[Thee Agora]] | last=Chao | date=26 October 2014 | access-date=18 January 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422095958/http://www.theeagora.com/the-lunatic-express-a-photo-essay-on-the-uganda-railway/ | archive-date=22 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230140/http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/working-papers/working-paper-draft-3-stewart-west.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 September 2015 | title=Policing, Colonial Life and Decolonisation in Uganda, 1957\u20131960 | publisher=The Ferguson Centre for African and Asian Studies, Working Paper No. 03 | last=West | first=Stewart | date=February 2012 | pages=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, a [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/4/pdfs/02-0626.pdf | title=Reanalyzing the 1900\u20131920 Sleeping Sickness Epidemic in Uganda | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | location=US | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | last1=F\u00e8vre | first1=E.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country.

Evidence from the [[Paleolithic]] era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and in 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1986 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed.

The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of [[Shivaji]] as the [[Chhatrapati]] and ended in 1818 with the defeat of ''[[Peshwa]]'' [[Bajirao II]] by the hands of the [[British East India Company]]. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in India.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}}{{sfnp|Capper|1997|p=|ps=:This source establishes the Maratha control of Delhi before the British}}{{sfnp|Sen|2010|pp=1941-|ps=:The victory at Bhopal in 1738 established Maratha dominance at the Mughal court}}{{#tag:ref| Some historians{{sfnp|Schmidt|2015|ppp=54-}} may consider 1645 as the founding of the empire because that was the year when the teenaged Shivaji captured a fort from Adilshahi sultanate.|group=note}}\n\nThe Marathas were a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking warrior group from the western [[Deccan Plateau]] (present-day [[Maharashtra]]) who rose to prominence by establishing a [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (meaning \"self-rule of Hindu/Indian people\").{{sfnp|Pagdi| 1993|p=98|ps=: Shivaji's coronation and setting himself up as a sovereign prince symbolises the rise of the Indian people in all parts of the country. It was a bid for ''Hindawi Swarajya'' (Indian rule), a term in use in Marathi sources of history.}}{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}} The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Shivaji Maharaj]], who revolted against the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]], and carved out a kingdom with [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]] as his capital. His father, [[Shahji]] had earlier conquered [[Thanjavur]] which Shivaji's step-brother, Venkoji Rao alias [[Ekoji]] inherited and that Kingdom was known as the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The descendants of Venkoji Rao speak [[Thanjavur Marathi dialect|Thanjavur Marathi]]. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the [[Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars]] and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAfter the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, [[Shahu I|Shahu]], grandson of Shivaji, was released by the Mughals.{{sfnp|Manohar |1959|p=63}} Following a brief struggle with his aunt [[Tarabai]], Shahu became the ruler and appointed [[Balaji Vishwanath]] and later, his descendants, as the ''[[peshwa]]s'' or prime ministers of the empire.{{sfnp|Ahmad|Krishnamurti|1962}} Balaji and his descendants played a key role in the expansion of Maratha rule. The empire at its peak stretched from [[Tamil Nadu]]{{sfnp|Mehta|2005|p=204|ps=}} in the south, to [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|Peshawar]] (modern-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]{{sfnp|Sen|2010|p=16}}{{#tag:ref|Many historians consider [[Attock]] to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire{{sfnp|Majumdar|1951b|p=}}|group=note}}) in the north, and [[Maratha expeditions in Bengal|Bengal Subah]] in the east. The Marathas discussed abolishing the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal throne]] and placing [[Vishwasrao|Vishwasrao Peshwa]] on the Mughal imperial throne in [[Delhi]] but were not able to do so.{{sfnp|Ghazi|2002|p=130}}  In 1761, the [[Maratha Army]] lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against  [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], which halted their imperial expansion into [[Afghanistan]]. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]]'s [[Maratha Resurrection]] reinstated Maratha authority over [[North India]].\n\nIn a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Madhavrao gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, and created a confederacy of Maratha states. These leaders became known as the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda State|Baroda]], the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore State|Indore]] and [[Malwa]], the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] and [[Ujjain]], the [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]], the Meheres of [[Vidharbha]] and the [[Paramara dynasty|Puars]] of [[Dhar State|Dhar]] and [[Dewas State|Dewas]]. In 1775, the [[East India Company]] intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in [[Pune]], which led to the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. The Marathas were victorious.{{sfnp|Naravane|2014|p=63}} The Maratha remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War|Second]] and [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]s (1805\u20131818), which resulted in the East India Company seizing control of most of India.\n\nA large portion of the Maratha empire was coastline, which had been secured by the potent [[Maratha Navy]] under commanders such as [[Kanhoji Angre]]. He was very successful at keeping foreign naval ships at bay, particularly those of the Portuguese and British.{{sfnp|Pagdi|1993|p=21}} Securing the coastal areas and building land-based fortifications were crucial aspects of the Maratha's defensive strategy and regional [[Military history of India|military history]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThe Maratha Empire is also referred to as the Maratha Confederacy. The historian [[Barbara Ramusack]] says that the former is a designation preferred by Indian nationalists, while the latter was that used by British historians. She notes, \"neither term is fully accurate since one implies a substantial degree of centralisation and the other signifies some surrender of power to a central government and a longstanding core of political administrators\".{{sfnp|Ramusack|2004|p=35}}\n\nAlthough at present, the word [[Maratha]] refers to a particular caste of warriors and peasants, in the past the word has been used to describe all [[Marathi people]].{{sfnp|Jones|1974|p=25}}{{sfnp|Gokhale |1988 |p=112}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe empire had its head in the [[Chhatrapati]] as ''de jure'', but the ''de facto'' governance was in the hands of the [[Peshwa]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After the death of Chhatrapati [[Shahu I]] and with the death of Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]], various chiefs played the role of the ''de facto'' rulers in their own regions.\n\n== Shivaji and his descendants ==\n\n=== Shivaji===\n{{Main|Shivaji }}\n[[File:Shivaji British Museum.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of Shivaji Maharaj]]\n\n[[Shivaji]] (1627\u20131680) was a Maratha aristocrat of the [[Bhosle|Bhosale]] clan who is the founder of the Maratha empire.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}} Shivaji led a resistance to free the people from the Sultanate of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] in 1645 by winning the fort Torna, followed by many more forts, placing the area under his control and establishing [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (self-rule of Hindu people{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}}). He created an independent Maratha kingdom with [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] as its capital{{sfnp|Vartak|1999|pp=1126\u20131134}} and successfully fought against the Mughals to defend his kingdom. He was crowned as [[Chhatrapati]] (sovereign) of the new Maratha kingdom in 1674.\n\nThe Maratha kingdom comprised about 4.1% of the subcontinent, but it was spread over large tracts. At the time of his death,{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}} it was reinforced with about 300 forts, and defended by about 40,000 cavalries, and 50,000 soldiers, as well as naval establishments along the west coast. Over time, the kingdom would increase in size and heterogeneity;{{sfnp|Kantak|1993|p=18}} by the time of his grandson's rule, and later under the Peshwas in the early 18th century, it was a full-fledged empire.{{sfnp|Mehta|2005|p=707|ps=:quote: It explains the rise to power of his Peshwa (prime minister) Balaji Vishwanath (1713\u201320) and the transformation of the Maratha kingdom into a vast empire, by the collective action of all the Maratha stalwarts.}}\n\n=== Chhatrapati Shambhaji Maharaj (Shambhu Raje) ===\n{{Main|Sambhaji}}\n[[File:Sambhaji painting late 17th century.png|alt=Sambhaji Bhosale was the eldest son of Shivaji |thumb|[[Sambhaji]], eldest son of Shivaji]]\n\nShivaji had two sons: [[Sambhaji]] and [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]], who had different mothers and were half-brothers. Sambhaji, the elder son, was very popular among the courtiers.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}} In 1681, Sambhaji succeeded to the crown after his father's death and resumed his expansionist policies. Sambhaji had earlier defeated the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Wodeyar|Chikka Deva Raya]] of [[Mysore]]. To nullify the alliance between his rebel son, Akbar, and the Maratha,{{sfnp|Richards|1995|p=12}} [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] headed south in 1681. With his entire imperial court, administration and an army of about 500,000 troops, he proceeded to expand the Mughal empire, gaining territories such as the sultanates of Bijapur and [[Golconda]].

All except Gaikwad chief of [[Baroda]], who had already accepted British protection by a separate treaty on 26 July 1802, supported the new regime. He made a treaty with the British. Also, Yashwant-Rao successfully resolved the disputes with Scindia and the Peshwa. He tried to unite the Maratha Confederacy but to no avail. In 1802, the British intervened in Baroda to support the heir to the throne against rival claimants and they signed a treaty with the new Maharaja recognising his independence from the Maratha Empire in return for his acknowledgment of British paramountcy. Before the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] (1803\u20131805), the Peshwa Baji Rao II signed a similar treaty. The defeat in [[Battle of Delhi, 1803]] during Second Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the loss of the city of Delhi for the Marathas.{{sfnp|Capper|1997|p=28}}\n\nThe Second Anglo-Maratha War represents the military high-water mark of the Marathas who posed the last serious opposition to the formation of the British Raj. The real contest for India was never a single decisive battle for the subcontinent. Rather it turned on a complex social and political struggle for control of the South Asian military economy. The victory in 1803 hinged as much on finance, diplomacy, politics and intelligence as it did on battlefield maneuver and war itself.{{sfnp|Cooper|2003|p=69}}\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

It left the British in control of most of India. The Peshwa was exiled to [[Bithoor]] (Marat, near Kanpur, [[Uttar Pradesh]]) as a pensioner of the British. The Maratha heartland of Desh, including Pune, came under direct British rule, with the exception of the states of [[Kolhapur]] and [[Satara (city)|Satara]], which retained local Maratha rulers (descendants of Shivaji and Sambhaji II ruled over Kolhapur). The Maratha-ruled states of Gwalior, Indore, and Nagpur all lost territory and came under subordinate alliance with the [[British Raj]] as [[princely states]] that retained internal sovereignty under British paramountcy.

Shivaji created the Peshwa designation in order to more effectively delegate administrative duties during the growth of the Maratha Empire. Prior to 1749, Peshwas held office for 8\u20139 years and controlled the [[Maratha Army]]. They later became the ''de facto'' hereditary administrators of the Maratha Empire from 1749 till its end in 1818.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nUnder Peshwa administration and with the support of several key generals and diplomats (listed below), the Maratha Empire reached its zenith, ruling most of the Indian subcontinent.

European traders described these attacks as [[piracy]], but the Marathas viewed them as legitimate targets because they were trading with, and thus financially supporting, their Mughal and Bijapur enemies. After the representatives of various European powers signed agreements with Shivaji or his successors that the threat of plundering or raids against Europeans began to reduce.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Maratha Empire, at its peak, ruled over a large area in the Indian sub-continent.

The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of [[Shivaji]] as the [[Chhatrapati]] and ended in 1818 with the defeat of ''[[Peshwa]]'' [[Bajirao II]] by the hands of the [[British East India Company]]. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in India.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}}{{sfnp|Capper|1997|p=|ps=:This source establishes the Maratha control of Delhi before the British}}{{sfnp|Sen|2010|pp=1941-|ps=:The victory at Bhopal in 1738 established Maratha dominance at the Mughal court}}{{#tag:ref| Some historians{{sfnp|Schmidt|2015|ppp=54-}} may consider 1645 as the founding of the empire because that was the year when the teenaged Shivaji captured a fort from Adilshahi sultanate.|group=note}}\n\nThe Marathas were a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking warrior group from the western [[Deccan Plateau]] (present-day [[Maharashtra]]) who rose to prominence by establishing a [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (meaning \"self-rule of Hindu/Indian people\").{{sfnp|Pagdi| 1993|p=98|ps=: Shivaji's coronation and setting himself up as a sovereign prince symbolises the rise of the Indian people in all parts of the country. It was a bid for ''Hindawi Swarajya'' (Indian rule), a term in use in Marathi sources of history.}}{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}} The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Shivaji Maharaj]], who revolted against the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]], and carved out a kingdom with [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]] as his capital. His father, [[Shahji]] had earlier conquered [[Thanjavur]] which Shivaji's step-brother, Venkoji Rao alias [[Ekoji]] inherited and that Kingdom was known as the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The descendants of Venkoji Rao speak [[Thanjavur Marathi dialect|Thanjavur Marathi]]. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the [[Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars]] and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAfter the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, [[Shahu I|Shahu]], grandson of Shivaji, was released by the Mughals.{{sfnp|Manohar |1959|p=63}} Following a brief struggle with his aunt [[Tarabai]], Shahu became the ruler and appointed [[Balaji Vishwanath]] and later, his descendants, as the ''[[peshwa]]s'' or prime ministers of the empire.{{sfnp|Ahmad|Krishnamurti|1962}} Balaji and his descendants played a key role in the expansion of Maratha rule. The empire at its peak stretched from [[Tamil Nadu]]{{sfnp|Mehta|2005|p=204|ps=}} in the south, to [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|Peshawar]] (modern-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]{{sfnp|Sen|2010|p=16}}{{#tag:ref|Many historians consider [[Attock]] to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire{{sfnp|Majumdar|1951b|p=}}|group=note}}) in the north, and [[Maratha expeditions in Bengal|Bengal Subah]] in the east. The Marathas discussed abolishing the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal throne]] and placing [[Vishwasrao|Vishwasrao Peshwa]] on the Mughal imperial throne in [[Delhi]] but were not able to do so.{{sfnp|Ghazi|2002|p=130}}  In 1761, the [[Maratha Army]] lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against  [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], which halted their imperial expansion into [[Afghanistan]]. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]]'s [[Maratha Resurrection]] reinstated Maratha authority over [[North India]].\n\nIn a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Madhavrao gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, and created a confederacy of Maratha states. These leaders became known as the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda State|Baroda]], the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore State|Indore]] and [[Malwa]], the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] and [[Ujjain]], the [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]], the Meheres of [[Vidharbha]] and the [[Paramara dynasty|Puars]] of [[Dhar State|Dhar]] and [[Dewas State|Dewas]]. In 1775, the [[East India Company]] intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in [[Pune]], which led to the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. The Marathas were victorious.{{sfnp|Naravane|2014|p=63}} The Maratha remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War|Second]] and [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]s (1805\u20131818), which resulted in the East India Company seizing control of most of India.\n\nA large portion of the Maratha empire was coastline, which had been secured by the potent [[Maratha Navy]] under commanders such as [[Kanhoji Angre]]. He was very successful at keeping foreign naval ships at bay, particularly those of the Portuguese and British.{{sfnp|Pagdi|1993|p=21}} Securing the coastal areas and building land-based fortifications were crucial aspects of the Maratha's defensive strategy and regional [[Military history of India|military history]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThe Maratha Empire is also referred to as the Maratha Confederacy. The historian [[Barbara Ramusack]] says that the former is a designation preferred by Indian nationalists, while the latter was that used by British historians. She notes, \"neither term is fully accurate since one implies a substantial degree of centralisation and the other signifies some surrender of power to a central government and a longstanding core of political administrators\".{{sfnp|Ramusack|2004|p=35}}\n\nAlthough at present, the word [[Maratha]] refers to a particular caste of warriors and peasants, in the past the word has been used to describe all [[Marathi people]].{{sfnp|Jones|1974|p=25}}{{sfnp|Gokhale |1988 |p=112}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe empire had its head in the [[Chhatrapati]] as ''de jure'', but the ''de facto'' governance was in the hands of the [[Peshwa]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After the death of Chhatrapati [[Shahu I]] and with the death of Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]], various chiefs played the role of the ''de facto'' rulers in their own regions.\n\n== Shivaji and his descendants ==\n\n=== Shivaji===\n{{Main|Shivaji }}\n[[File:Shivaji British Museum.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of Shivaji Maharaj]]\n\n[[Shivaji]] (1627\u20131680) was a Maratha aristocrat of the [[Bhosle|Bhosale]] clan who is the founder of the Maratha empire.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}} Shivaji led a resistance to free the people from the Sultanate of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] in 1645 by winning the fort Torna, followed by many more forts, placing the area under his control and establishing [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (self-rule of Hindu people{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}}). He created an independent Maratha kingdom with [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] as its capital{{sfnp|Vartak|1999|pp=1126\u20131134}} and successfully fought against the Mughals to defend his kingdom.

With his entire imperial court, administration and an army of about 500,000 troops, he proceeded to expand the Mughal empire, gaining territories such as the sultanates of Bijapur and [[Golconda]].

The real contest for India was never a single decisive battle for the subcontinent. Rather it turned on a complex social and political struggle for control of the South Asian military economy.

Nana's administrative, diplomatic and financial skills brought prosperity to the Maratha Empire and his management of external affairs kept the Maratha Empire away from the thrust of the British East India Company.\n\n== Rulers, administrators and generals ==\n\n=== Royal houses ===\n\n* [[Shivaji]] (1630\u20131680)\n* [[Sambhaji]] (1657\u20131689)\n* [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] (1670\u20131700)\n\n'''Satara''':\n\n* [[Shahu I]] ({{reign|1708|1749}}) (alias Shivaji II, son of Sambhaji)\n* [[Ramaraja]] II (nominally, grandson of Rajaram and Queen Tarabai) ({{reign|1749|1777}})\n* [[Shahu II of Satara|Shahu II]] ({{reign|1777|1808}})\n* [[Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara|Pratap Singh]] ({{reign|1808|1839}}) \u2013 signed a treaty with the East India company ceding part of sovereignty to the company{{sfnp|Kulkarni|1995|p=21}}\n\n'''Kolhapur''':\n\n* [[Tarabai]] (1675\u20131761) (wife of Rajaram) in the name of her son Shivaji II\n* [[Shivaji II]] (1700\u20131714)\n* [[Sambhaji II]] (1714 to 1760) \u2013 came to power by deposing his half brother Shivaji II\n* [[Shivaji III]] (1760\u20131812) (adopted from the family of Khanwilkar)\n\n=== Peshwas ===\n\n* [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] (1657\u20131683)\n* [[Moreshvar Pingale|Nilakanth Moreshvar Pingale]] (1683-1689)\n* [[Ramchandra Pant Amatya]] (1689-1708)\n* [[Bahiroji Pingale]] (1708\u20131711)\n* [[Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi|Parshuram Trimbak Kulkarni]] (1711-1713)\n\n==== Peshwas from Bhat family ====\n\nFrom Balaji Vishwanath onwards, actual power gradually shifted to the Bhat family Peshwas based in [[Poona]].\n\n* [[Balaji Vishwanath]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Bajirao]] (1720\u20131740)\n* [[Nanasaheb Peshwa|Balaji Bajirao]] (4 Jul 1740 \u2013 23 Jun 1761) (b. 8 Dec 1721, d. 23 Jun 1761)\n* [[Madhavrao Peshwa]] (1761 \u2013 18 Nov 1772) (b. 16 Feb 1745, d. 18 Nov 1772)\n* [[Narayanrao Bajirao]] (13 Dec 1772 \u2013 30 Aug 1773) (b. 10 Aug 1755, d. 30 Aug 1773)\n* [[Raghunathrao]] (5 Dec 1773 \u2013 1774) (b. 18 Aug 1734, d. 11 Dec 1783)\n* [[Sawai Madhava Rao II Narayan]] (1774 \u2013 27 Oct 1795) (b. 18 Apr 1774, d. 27 Oct 1795)\n* [[Baji Rao II]] (6 Dec 1796 \u2013 3 Jun 1818) (d. 28 Jan 1851)\n\n== Houses of Maratha Confederacy ==\n\n* [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]]\n* [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior]]\n* [[Gaikwad]]s of [[Baroda]]\n* [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur]]\n* [[Puars]] of [[Dewas]] and [[Dhar]]\n* [[Patwardhans]]\n*[[Bhoite Saranjam|Bhoite's]] of Jalgaon, [[Bhoite|Aradgaon]]\n\n== Maps showing the Maratha Empire at different stages of history ==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Shivaji's kingdom 1680.jpg|Maratha kingdom in 1680 ''(green)''\nFile:India1760 1905.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1760 ''(yellow)''\nFile:IGI1908India1765a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1765 ''(yellow)''\nFile:Joppen1907India1795a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1794 ''(yellow)''\nFile:Joppen1907India1805a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1805 \n</gallery>\n\n== Thanjavur Maratha Kingdom (Tamil Nadu) ==\n{{Main|Thanjavur Marathas}}\n[[File:Thanjavur Maratha Palace Darbar Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Thanjavur Maratha palace]]]]\n\nThe Thanjavur Marathas were the rulers of [[Thanjavur]] principality of Tamil Nadu between the 17th and 19th centuries.

Finished in 2010, it is operated as a charter vessel in South East Asia.\n\n== Background ==\nThe ''Naga Pelangi'' was built for Christoph Swoboda from Germany by the craftsmen of [[Duyong Island]] in the estuary of the [[Terengganu River]] in the state of Terengganu on the east coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]].<ref>Duyong Dawn of a new ara, Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Wan Ramli Wan Muhammad, 2006, p1/96ff</ref> It is a Malay-style sailing boat with lines based on the traditional [[Pinas (ship)|''pinas'']]-design but finished to modern yacht standards.\n\nIn Malaysia, these sailing boats are called ''Perahu Besar'', ({{lang-ms|big boat}}).<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate_t?&text=Perahu%20Besar</ref><ref>Duyong Dawn of a new ara, Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Wan Ramli Wan Muhammad, 2006, p94</ref> They were built for cargo and piracy and are made in two types, the [[Bedar (ship)|''bedar'']] and the [[Pinas (ship)|''pinas'']].<ref name=\"new ara-p95\">Duyong Dawn of a new ara, Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Wan Ramli Wan Muhammad, 2006, p95</ref> They are made of [[chengal]] wood (''[[Neobalanocarpus heimii]]''), a heavy hardwood of the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]] growing only on the Malay peninsula,<ref>100 Malaysian Timbers, published by Malaysian Timber Industry Board, 1986, p16/17</ref> the home of the world's oldest rainforest.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} These picturesque junk rigged boats have been used in the [[South China Sea]] for centuries and the last few were still in operation as sailing freighters in the 1980s.\n\n[[File:NAGA PELANGI sailing off the coast of Kuala Terengganu, 1998.jpg|thumb|left|''Naga Pelangi'', after her circumnavigation sailing off Kuala Terenganu, 1998]] \nSwoboda had a ''bedar'' built by the same craftsmen in 1981, finished a circumnavigation with that boat (the original ''Naga Pelangi'') in 1998 and after selling it, he ordered a new vessel to be built \u2013 the ''pinas'' ''Naga Pelangi'' \u2013 in order to help keep this ancient boat building tradition alive.<ref>50 Years Malaysian-German Relations, Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, p132/133</ref>\n\nThe Malays have developed an indigenous technique to build wooden boats. They build without plans, hull first, frames later. The planks are fire bent and joined [[Carvel (boat building)|edge on edge]] using ''basok'' (wooden dowels) made from ''Penaga''-[[ironwood]] (''[[Mesua ferrea]]''). There is no European style [[caulking]] hammered into a groove between the planks: Before the new plank is hammered home, a strip of paperbarks skin ({{lang-ms|kulit gelam}})<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate_t?&text=kulit%20gelam</ref> of the ''[[Melaleuca]]'' species is placed over the dowels. This {{convert|1|\u2013|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} layer of a natural material has sealing properties.<ref name=\"CargoBoats-p106-125\">Cargo Boats of the East Coast of Malaya, Gibson-Hill, C.A. (1949), JMBRAS 22(3), p106-125</ref> It is an ancient and unique building technique, the origins of which might date back to the [[Proto-Malay]] migrations that colonised the archipelago thousands of years ago.\n\n{{As of|2013}}, Naga Pelangi is operated by its owner in the eastern [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Andaman Sea]] with a base in [[Langkawi]] island and in the South China Sea with a base in Kuala Terengganu.\n\n== Name \u2013 Etymology ==\n[[File:The Naga Pelangi - figurehead - gobel.jpg|thumb|The Naga Pelangi ''gobel'' figurehead]]\nIn modern Malay, ''Naga Pelangi'', translated literally, means \"Rainbow Dragon\".<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate_t?&text=naga+pelangi</ref> [[N\u0101ga]] is a Sanskrit word and means snake and depicts a mythical snake like creature in the [[Mahabharata]]. For lack of another word, modern Malay uses this Indian word to denominate the Chinese symbol of the dragon.\n\nAll over South East Asia, in Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer culture, Nagas are found in various form, half snake, half dragon. For the pre-Islamic Malays the Naga was a deity living in the sea and was held in great esteem by the seafarers. Sacrifices were offered to ask for an auspicious journey and frequently the bow of their craft was adorned with a [[figurehead (object)|figurehead]] of a carved Naga. This detailed carving was reduced to a stylised carving in later times due to the strict picture ban of the Islam. The figurehead of a Malay pinas is called ''gobel'',<ref name=\"new ara-p95\" /><ref>Boats, Boatbuilding and Fishing in Malaysia, The Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, p340</ref> with the elements of the old Naga shining through.\n\n== History ==\nThe tradition of building wooden boats in modern Malaysia goes back centuries: For overseas trade, for fishing, for piracy, for travelling up the many rivers, for each purpose a special design was developed.<ref name=\"Ingram-p70\">Keeping the Tradition of Boatbuilding Alive, Keith Ingram, Magazine: Professional Skipper March/April 2007, p70</ref> When [[Malacca]] became the main trading centre for spices arriving from the [[Maluku Islands]], Indonesia, the Malay peninsula turned into a melting pot of the seafaring, trading civilisations: Indians and Chinese, Arabs and Indonesians, Vietnamese and Thai, Burmese, Europeans and others, all arrived in their distinctive craft, inspiring Malaysian shipbuilding.<ref name=\"Ingram-p70\" />\n\n[[File:A Malay Junk of the Pinas-type.jpg|thumb|left|British postage stamp depicting a Malay ''pinas'', 1955]]\nOne of the stories told is that on the eastern shore of an island in the Terengganu river mouth once sat a mermaid, an indo-pacific [[Sirenia|sea cow]] (''[[Dugong|Dugong dugon]]''). Thus the island was named [[Duyong Island|Pulau Duyong]] ({{lang-ms|pulau}} =island).<ref>https://translate.google.com/#ms/en/pulau</ref> According to legend, an historic Sultan of Terengganu encouraged the [[Bugis]], a seafaring people from [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] (Sulawesi, Indonesia), to settle on the island and establish a trade post. He meant to encourage trade on the east coast of the peninsula, as the Bugis were well known throughout South East Asia as traders, boat builders and pirates. They settled and stayed and it was there that boatbuilding in Malaya developed. During the times of [[Zheng He|Cheng Ho]], a noted Chinese seafarer and explorer, the Terengganu boatbuilders were already known for their craft. A temple built in honour of Ho is situated up the Terengganu river in memory of his visit to this place.\n\nIn the 19th century, a French captain is said to have marvelled at the sight of a flotilla of trading vessels assembled from all corners of the globe in the harbour off Duyong island: Arab [[dhow]]s, Indonesian [[Proa|perahus]], Portuguese [[lorcha (boat)|lorchas]], English schooners, and Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai junks. The two ''perahu besar'' of Terengganu, the ''pinas'' and the ''bedar'' are the result of this cultural interchange. ''[[Pinas]]'' carry traces of French influence from French [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinasse]],<ref>Cargo Boats of the East Coast of Malaya, Gibson-Hill, C.A. (1949), JMBRAS 22(3), p108-110</ref> while the bedar shows Arab/Indian ([[dhow]]) elements. Jib and bowsprit in the two are of western origin, as junks almost never carry these features.<ref name=\"CargoBoats-p106-125\" /> The sails of both of types are that of a classic Chinese junk: The rigging has an elaborate [[sheet (sailing)|sheet]] system, [[Parrel beads|parrels]], [[snotter]] and [[lazy jack]] system. All have been documented in Chinese literature for over 2000 years. The desire for ever faster and more manoeuvrable vessels combined these positive elements and created these junk hybrids.\n\nThe boatbuilders of Terengganu were re-discovered during the [[World War II]] by the Japanese navy, who had wooden minesweepers built there by the carpenters and fishing folks.<ref name=\"Ingram-p70\" /> After the war, the Malays stopped building sailing boats for their own use, but they kept manufacturing [[fishing trawler]]s and ferries, using the old techniques. Rising timber prices and lack of demand forced one yard after another out of business, so today this tradition is on the brink of extinction, with very few craftsmen still practicing the old building technique.<ref>Boats, Boatbuilding and Fishing in Malaysia, The Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,, MBRAS 2009, p342</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:The Naga Pelangi sailing butterfly.JPG|''Naga Pelangi'' sailing butterfly\nFile:The Naga Pelangi - view from the Mast down to the foredeck.jpg|Birds-eye view from one of the masts\nFile:Naga Pelangi on the slip in Satun - Thailand, 2010.JPG|On the hard in Satun Thailand 2011\nFile:Naga Pelangi cockpit with companion way.jpg|Cockpit with companionway\nFile:The Naga Pelangi - view aft.JPG|Deck layout\nFile:Traditional Malay boat building.jpg|Building the ''Naga Pelangi'', 2004 \u2013 frames are adjusted to hull\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n*[[Bedar (ship)]]\n*[[Chengal]]\n*[[Junk (ship)]]\n*[[Junk rig]]\n*[[Junk Keying]]\n*[[List of schooners]]\n*[[Lorcha (boat)]]\n*[[Tongkang]]\n*[[Lashed-lug boat]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Naga Pelangi}}\n*[http://www.naga-pelangi.com/ Naga Pelangi, the Rainbow Dragon Charter Cruises]\n*[http://www.junkrigassociation.org/ Junk Rig Association]\n*[http://www.thecheappages.com/junk/platt/platt_chinese_sail.html#Top Brian Platt's \"The Chinese Sail\"]\n*The [http://www.dragonvoyage.com/ship/rig.shtml Voyage of the Dragon King, Details of the junk rig, incl. diagrams and photos]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130208194104/http://skipper.co.nz/S56%20Web/S56%20Trad%20Boatbuilding%20p70-72.pdf Magazine \"Professional Skipper\" article about the boatbuilding in Duyong]\n*[http://www.kuala-lumpur.diplo.de/contentblob/1817388/Daten/ Article published in \"50 Years Malaysian-German Relations\", Embassy of Germany in Kuala Lumpur]\n*[https://archive.is/20130615212700/http://woodwizard.my/report.asp?ItemID=22 Chengal wood]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Individual sailing vessels]]\n[[Category:Schooners]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:2004 ships]]\n[[Category:Terengganu]]\n[[Category:Ships of Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin|display title=ital}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=File:The Naga Pelangi under full canvas.JPG\n|Ship image size=300px\n|Ship caption=The pinas ''Naga Pelangi'' in [[Langkawi]], 2010\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country= Germany\n|Ship flag= [[File:Flag of Germany.svg|60px|Germany]]\n|Ship name= ''Naga Pelangi''\n|Ship ordered=2003\n|Ship builder=Traditional Malay\n|Ship laid down=2004\n|Ship launched=2009\n|Ship registry=[[Heidelberg]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=\n|Ship decommissioned=\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship renamed=\n|Ship fate=\n|Ship status=Charter vessel\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship type=Traditional Malay junk schooner\n|Ship displacement=  {{convert|70|t|ST}}\n|Ship length= {{convert|22|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[Length overall#LOD|LOD]]\n|Ship beam=  {{convert|6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draft=  {{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship hold depth=\n|Ship decks=\n|Ship deck clearance=\n|Ship power=\n|Ship propulsion=Sail; auxiliary engine\n|Ship sail plan=Junk schooner, {{convert|300|m2|sqft}} total sail area\n|Ship capacity=8 persons (not including crew)\n|Ship crew=4\n}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image= [[File:Malaysia CIA map.png|center|300px]]\n}}\n|}\n\n'''''Naga Pelangi''''' (Rainbow Dragon) is a wooden [[Junk rig|junk rigged]] [[schooner]] of the Malay [[Pinas (ship)|pinas]] type built from 2004 to 2009 in [[Kuala Terengganu]], Malaysia. Finished in 2010, it is operated as a charter vessel in South East Asia.\n\n== Background ==\nThe ''Naga Pelangi'' was built for Christoph Swoboda from Germany by the craftsmen of [[Duyong Island]] in the estuary of the [[Terengganu River]] in the state of Terengganu on the east coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]].<ref>Duyong Dawn of a new ara, Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Wan Ramli Wan Muhammad, 2006, p1/96ff</ref> It is a Malay-style sailing boat with lines based on the traditional [[Pinas (ship)|''pinas'']]-design but finished to modern yacht standards.\n\nIn Malaysia, these sailing boats are called ''Perahu Besar'', ({{lang-ms|big boat}}).<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate_t?&text=Perahu%20Besar</ref><ref>Duyong Dawn of a new ara, Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Wan Ramli Wan Muhammad, 2006, p94</ref> They were built for cargo and piracy and are made in two types, the [[Bedar (ship)|''bedar'']] and the [[Pinas (ship)|''pinas'']].<ref name=\"new ara-p95\">Duyong Dawn of a new ara, Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Wan Ramli Wan Muhammad, 2006, p95</ref> They are made of [[chengal]] wood (''[[Neobalanocarpus heimii]]''), a heavy hardwood of the ''[[Dipterocarpaceae]]'' family growing only on the Malay peninsula,<ref>100 Malaysian Timbers, published by Malaysian Timber Industry Board, 1986, p16/17</ref> the home of the world's oldest rainforest.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} These picturesque junk rigged boats have been used in the [[South China Sea]] for centuries and the last few were still in operation as sailing freighters in the 1980s.\n\n[[File:NAGA PELANGI sailing off the coast of Kuala Terengganu, 1998.jpg|thumb|left|''Naga Pelangi'', after her circumnavigation sailing off Kuala Terenganu, 1998]] \nSwoboda had a ''bedar'' built by the same craftsmen in 1981, finished a circumnavigation with that boat (the original ''Naga Pelangi'') in 1998 and after selling it, he ordered a new vessel to be built \u2013 the ''pinas'' ''Naga Pelangi'' \u2013 in order to help keep this ancient boat building tradition alive.<ref>50 Years Malaysian-German Relations, Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, p132/133</ref>\n\nThe Malays have developed an indigenous technique to build wooden boats. They build without plans, hull first, frames later. The planks are fire bent and joined [[Carvel (boat building)|edge on edge]] using ''basok'' (wooden dowels) made from ''Penaga''-[[ironwood]] (''[[Mesua ferrea]]''). There is no European style [[caulking]] hammered into a groove between the planks: Before the new plank is hammered home, a strip of paperbarks skin ({{lang-ms|kulit gelam}})<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate_t?&text=kulit%20gelam</ref> of the ''[[Melaleuca]]'' species is placed over the dowels. This {{convert|1|\u2013|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} layer of a natural material has sealing properties.<ref name=\"CargoBoats-p106-125\">Cargo Boats of the East Coast of Malaya, Gibson-Hill, C.A. (1949), JMBRAS 22(3), p106-125</ref> It is an ancient and unique building technique, the origins of which might date back to the [[Proto-Malay]] migrations that colonised the archipelago thousands of years ago.\n\n{{As of|2013}}, Naga Pelangi is operated by its owner in the eastern [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Andaman Sea]] with a base in [[Langkawi]] island and in the South China Sea with a base in Kuala Terengganu.\n\n== Name \u2013 Etymology ==\n[[File:The Naga Pelangi - figurehead - gobel.jpg|thumb|The Naga Pelangi ''gobel'' figurehead]]\nIn modern Malay, ''Naga Pelangi'', translated literally, means \"Rainbow Dragon\".<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate_t?&text=naga+pelangi</ref> [[N\u0101ga]] is a Sanskrit word and means snake and depicts a mythical snake like creature in the [[Mahabharata]]. For lack of another word, modern Malay uses this Indian word to denominate the Chinese symbol of the dragon.\n\nAll over South East Asia, in Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer culture, Nagas are found in various form, half snake, half dragon. For the pre-Islamic Malays the Naga was a deity living in the sea and was held in great esteem by the seafarers. Sacrifices were offered to ask for an auspicious journey and frequently the bow of their craft was adorned with a [[figurehead (object)|figurehead]] of a carved Naga. This detailed carving was reduced to a stylised carving in later times due to the strict picture ban of the Islam. The figurehead of a Malay pinas is called ''gobel'',<ref name=\"new ara-p95\" /><ref>Boats, Boatbuilding and Fishing in Malaysia, The Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, p340</ref> with the elements of the old Naga shining through.\n\n== History ==\nThe tradition of building wooden boats in modern Malaysia goes back centuries: For overseas trade, for fishing, for piracy, for travelling up the many rivers, for each purpose a special design was developed.<ref name=\"Ingram-p70\">Keeping the Tradition of Boatbuilding Alive, Keith Ingram, Magazine: Professional Skipper March/April 2007, p70</ref> When [[Malacca]] became the main trading centre for spices arriving from the [[Maluku Islands]], Indonesia, the Malay peninsula turned into a melting pot of the seafaring, trading civilisations: Indians and Chinese, Arabs and Indonesians, Vietnamese and Thai, Burmese, Europeans and others, all arrived in their distinctive craft, inspiring Malaysian shipbuilding.<ref name=\"Ingram-p70\" />\n\n[[File:A Malay Junk of the Pinas-type.jpg|thumb|left|British postage stamp depicting a Malay ''pinas'', 1955]]\nOne of the stories told is that on the eastern shore of an island in the Terengganu river mouth once sat a mermaid, an indo-pacific [[Sirenia|sea cow]] (''[[Dugong|Dugong dugon]]''). Thus the island was named [[Duyong Island|Pulau Duyong]] ({{lang-ms|pulau}} =island).<ref>https://translate.google.com/#ms/en/pulau</ref> According to legend, an historic Sultan of Terengganu encouraged the [[Bugis]], a seafaring people from [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] (Sulawesi, Indonesia), to settle on the island and establish a trade post. He meant to encourage trade on the east coast of the peninsula, as the Bugis were well known throughout South East Asia as traders, boat builders and pirates. They settled and stayed and it was there that boatbuilding in Malaya developed. During the times of [[Zheng He|Cheng Ho]], a noted Chinese seafarer and explorer, the Terengganu boatbuilders were already known for their craft. A temple built in honour of Ho is situated up the Terengganu river in memory of his visit to this place.\n\nIn the 19th century, a French captain is said to have marvelled at the sight of a flotilla of trading vessels assembled from all corners of the globe in the harbour off Duyong island: Arab [[dhow]]s, Indonesian [[Proa|perahus]], Portuguese [[lorcha (boat)|lorchas]], English schooners, and Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai junks. The two ''perahu besar'' of Terengganu, the ''pinas'' and the ''bedar'' are the result of this cultural interchange. ''[[Pinas]]'' carry traces of French influence from French [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinasse]],<ref>Cargo Boats of the East Coast of Malaya, Gibson-Hill, C.A. (1949), JMBRAS 22(3), p108-110</ref> while the bedar shows Arab/Indian ([[dhow]]) elements. Jib and bowsprit in the two are of western origin, as junks almost never carry these features.<ref name=\"CargoBoats-p106-125\" /> The sails of both of types are that of a classic Chinese junk: The rigging has an elaborate [[sheet (sailing)|sheet]] system, [[Parrel beads|parrels]], [[snotter]] and [[lazy jack]] system. All have been documented in Chinese literature for over 2000 years. The desire for ever faster and more manoeuvrable vessels combined these positive elements and created these junk hybrids.\n\nThe boatbuilders of Terengganu were re-discovered during the [[World War II]] by the Japanese navy, who had wooden minesweepers built there by the carpenters and fishing folks.<ref name=\"Ingram-p70\" /> After the war, the Malays stopped building sailing boats for their own use, but they kept manufacturing [[fishing trawler]]s and ferries, using the old techniques.

[[pneumonia]] cases in [[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei|Hubei Province]], China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.
