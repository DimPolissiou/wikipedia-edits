Hewitt''' was a prominent architectural firm in the eastern United States at the turn of the twentieth century. It was founded in [[Philadelphia]] in 1878, by brothers '''George Wattson Hewitt''' (1841\u20131916) and '''William Dempster Hewitt''' (1847\u20131924), both members of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. The firm specialized in churches, hotels and palatial residences, especially crenelated mansions such as Maybrook (1881), [[Druim Moir Historic District|Druim Moir]] (1885\u201386) and [[Boldt Castle]] (1900\u201304). The last was built for [[George C. Boldt]], owner of Philadelphia's [[Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]] (1902\u201304), G.W. & W.D. Hewitt's most well-known building.<ref>David R. Contosta, ''Suburb in the City: Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, 1850-1990'' (Ohio State University Press, 1992)</ref>\n\n==Career==\nGeorge Hewitt worked in the office of [[John Notman]], and became an expert on English [[ecclesiastical]] architecture. In 1867, he formed a partnership with [[John Fraser (architect)|John Fraser]] and [[Frank Furness]], which lasted until 1871. The younger men formed their own firm, Furness & Hewitt, whose most notable building was the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1871\u201376). [[Louis Sullivan]] worked briefly as a draftsman for Furness & Hewitt (June \u2013 November 1873), and left descriptions of the Hewitt brothers (speaking of himself in third person as \"Louis\"):\n<blockquote>\nGeorge Hewitt [was] a slender, moustached person, pale and reserved, who seldom relaxed from pose. It was he who did the Victorian Gothic in its pantalettes, when a church building or something of the sort was on the board. With precision, as though he held his elements by pincers, he worked out the decorous sublimities of inanity, as per the English current magazines and other English sources. He was a clean draftsman, and believed implicitly that all that was good was English. Louis regarded him with admiration as a draftsman, and with mild contempt as a man who kept his nose in books.\n\nBut George Hewitt had a younger brother named John [sic], and John was foreman of the shop. He was a husky, smooth-faced fellow under thirty. Every feature in his clean cut, rather elongated face, bespoke intelligence and kindness, in fact a big heart. He had taken a fancy to Louis from the start. He was the 'practical man' and Louis ran to him for advice whenever he found himself in a tight place. John was patience itself and made everything clear with dainty sketches and explanatory notes. These drawings were beautiful and Louis frankly told him so. He begged John to teach him 'touch' and how to make such sketches, and especially how to 'indicate' so crisply. This John did. In fact, it was not long before he made of Louis a draftsman of the Upper crust, and Louis's heart went out to lovable John in sheer gratitude.<ref>Louis Sullivan, ''Autobiography of an Idea'' (1924; reprint, New York: Dover, 1956), pp. 190-96.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:St Petes Philly.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|St. Peter's Episcopal Church of Germantown, 1873]]\nWriting a half century after the fact, Sullivan misremembered William Hewitt's name (there was no John Hewitt). Furness & Hewitt continued until 1875, and George opened his own firm, making his brother William a partner in 1878.\n\nIn the early 1880s, [[Henry H. Houston]], a director of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], began developing {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} in the western [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chestnut Hill]] section of Philadelphia. The Hewitt brothers did the planning for the upper-class suburb and designed the principal buildings, including a resort hotel, the Wissahickon Inn (1883\u201384) (now [[Chestnut Hill Academy]]); the first clubhouse for the [[Philadelphia Cricket Club]] (1883\u201384, burned 1909); Houston's own mansion, [[Druim Moir Historic District|Druim Moir]] (1886); and St. Martin-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church (1888).

Straddling the [[Henares River]], it is located {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northeast of the centre of [[Madrid]]. {{As of|2018}}, it has a population of 193,751, making it the region's third most populated [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality]].\n\nPredated by earlier settlements (''[[oppidum|oppida]]'') on the left bank of the Henares, the city has its origins in the ''{{ill|Complutum|es}}'' settlement founded in Roman times on the right bank (North) of the river, that became a bishopric seat in the 5th century. One of the several Muslim citadels in the Middle Mark of [[al-Andalus]] (hence the name ''Alcal\u00e1'', a derivative of the Arabic term for citadel) was established on the left bank, while, after the Christian conquest culminated circa 1118, the bulk of the urban nucleus returned to the right bank. For much of the late middle-ages and the early modern period before becoming part of the province of Madrid, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares was a seigneurial estate of the archbishop of Toledo.\n\nIts historical centre is one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nThe city has a long university tradition. [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]] founded the [[Complutense_University_of_Madrid#History_2|Complutense University]] in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares in the late 15th century. The city currently hosts the (refounded) [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]. It is the native city of [[Miguel de Cervantes]].\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the mayor is {{ill|Javier Rodr\u00edguez Palacios|es}} ([[PSOE]]).<ref name=\"marcos\">{{Cite journal|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2015/06/13/madrid/1434206613_236578.html|journal=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|title=Alcal\u00e1 de Henares vuelve a ser un s\u00edmbolo para el PSOE|first=Jos\u00e9|last=Marcos|date=2015-06-13}}</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nLocally, it is generally known simply as ''Alcal\u00e1'', but ''de Henares'' is appended when needed to differentiate it from a dozen Spanish cities sharing the name [[Alcal\u00e1 (disambiguation)|Alcal\u00e1]] (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629}} {{transl|ar|al-qal\u02bfa}} for fortification or [[citadel]], typically a [[castle]]). The [[Latin]] name, ''Complutum'', is sometimes used.\n\n==History==\nThe city boundaries have been inhabited since the [[Chalcolithic]] phase of the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered the area in the 1st century BC, and built the town of ''Complutum'' near a previous [[Carpetani]]an settlement, called ''Iplacea''. Thus, it became the only Roman town in the Madrid region. With 10,000 inhabitants, it reached the status of ''[[Municipium]]'' and had its own governing institutions. It played an important role, located on the roman road connecting ''[[Emerita Augusta]]'' and ''[[Caesaraugusta]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM002175.pdf|page=12|year=2003|title=La ciudad romana de Complutum.

Torre albarrana de Alcala la Vieja.jpg|thumb|left|Tower of the Old Castle of Alcal\u00e1 La Vieja]]\nWhen the [[Moorish invasion of Iberia|Moors arrived]] in 711, they subdued the Visigothic city and founded another site, building an {{transl|ar|al-qal\u02bfa}}, which means \"citadel\" in Arabic, on a nearby hill, today known as {{lang|es|Alcal\u00e1 la Vieja}} (Old Alcal\u00e1). On 3 May 1118, it was [[Reconquista|reconquered]] by the Archbishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] [[Bernard de Sedirac]] in the name of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. The Christians preferred the ''Burgo de Santiuste'' (\"Saint Just's borough\") on the original Roman site and the Arab one was abandoned. The city was ceded to the Bishopric of Toledo, which granted it ferial rights. Under [[Christians|Christian]] rule until the end of the Reconquista, the city had both a Jewish and a Moorish quarter and a renowned marketplace. Its central position allowed it to be a frequent residence of the [[Kings of Castile]], when travelling south.\n\nAt some time in the 1480s, [[Christopher Columbus]] had his first meeting with the ''[[Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'', [[King Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and his wife [[Queen Isabella I of Castile]], who financed the travel for the ''[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Discovery of America]]''.\n\nThe city suffered severe damage during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n===Historic figures and events===\n[[File:Quijote and Sancho.jpg|thumb|left|Statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza outside Cervantes' birthplace]]\n\nThe author [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, and baptized in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda in 1547, although his family moved from the city when he was still young. The city celebrates his birthday, 9 October, every year and organizes an annual Cervantes festival. \n\n[[File:Paul Gustave Louis Christophe Dor\u00e9 IV.jpg|thumb|[[Miguel de Cervantes]] (the author of) Don Quijote (Don Quixote) illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nEvery year on 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes' death, the city of Alcal\u00e1 hosts the ceremony awarding the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize|Cervantes Prize]], the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]]'s most prestigious award for lifetime achievement in literature. The award is presented by the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] at the University of Alcal\u00e1's historic \"''Colegio de San Ildefonso.''\" Speeches about the importance of the Spanish language are customarily given by the King, the Minister of Culture and the laureate. The ceremony attracts a wide range of dignitaries to the city including members of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister, and others.  During this ceremony the citizens of Alcal\u00e1 can be heard singing the city's song, entitled \"Alcal\u00e1 de Henares.\"\n\nOther notable figures associated with the city are [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]], the mystic [[John of the Cross]], the theologian [[Gabriel V\u00e1zquez Saavedra y Rojas|Gabriel V\u00e1zquez]], the poet [[Juan Ruiz]], Arcipreste de Hita, and [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a D\u00edaz]], writer and politician, who was President of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] between 1936 and 1939. The historian [[Antonio de Sol\u00eds y Ribadeneyra|Antonio de Sol\u00eds]] was also probably born here. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] was once a student at the university, yet after several confrontations with the [[Spanish Inquisition]], he left the city.\n\nAlcal\u00e1 hosts an annual \"Noche en Blanco.\"  During this festival the streets are filled with music, art, theatre, and dance as the city residents celebrate Alcal\u00e1's rich cultural heritage.  The festival goes well into the night and centers around the Plaza de Cervantes where stages are set up to host the performances.\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\n[[File:ComplutumEstaciones.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman mosaic (part of the archeological ensemble of Complutum) representing the four [[season]]s from the House of Bacchus.]]\n[[File:Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Palacio Arzobispal 6045.JPG|thumb|Tower of Tenorio of the [[Archbishop's Palace of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|Archbishop's Palace of Alcal\u00e1]].]]\nThe town of historic importance was one of the first [[Diocese|bishoprics]] founded in Spain.\n\nThe polyglot Bible known as the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]], the first of the many similar Bibles produced during the revival of Biblical studies that took place in the 16th century,  was printed at Alcal\u00e1 under the care of [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]].\n\nA [[papal bull]] of 7 March 1885, united Alcal\u00e1 with (effectively merging it into) the [[diocese of Madrid]], which includes the civil province of Madrid, [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Toledo]]. The bishop's residence has since been used for preserving historical archives. It was designed by [[Alonso Berruguete]] and has a famous staircase.\n\n===Jewish history===\nDuring [[Muslim]] rule, the [[Jewish]] community of the city was granted equal rights as the [[Christians]] living in it. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Jewish congregation of the city paid taxes to the [[Archbishop of Toledo]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00697.html Alcal\u00e1 de Henares<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Jews]] of Alcala were mentioned in the 14th-century Satire by [[Marrano]] [[Pero Ferr\u00fas]]. During the 15th century, the Jewish congregation of the city was one of the largest in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], having about 200 Jewish families. [[Hebrew]] studies at the [[University of Alcala]] were encouraged by Cardinal [[Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros]] during the 16th century, bringing some Jews and [[Marrano]] Hebraists to work in the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The location of the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] of the city is well known &ndash; between Mayor, Santiago, Imagen and Cervantes streets. One [[synagogue]] stood in Carmen Calzado street, no. 10. The other was on Santiago street. After the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]] Jews were requested to become Christians to continue living in Castile and Aragon; those who refused had to leave these kingdoms and most of them found residence in the North of Africa, Amsterdam and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe origins of Miguel de Cervantes' family are supposed (there is no total certainty) to be Jewish. Because his father worked on the former Jewish neighbourhood, the birthplace was close to the workplace, and also because the surname Cervantes makes reference to a different site in the Northwest of Spain, and geographical surnames were common among the Jewish population.\n\n==University==\n{{Main article|University of Alcal\u00e1}}\n[[File:Universidad de Alcala.jpg|thumb|The ''rectorado'' of the [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]]]\nThe major landmark and one of the great prides of the city, its university, uses sites throughout the city, but has two main campuses. The first is on the north side of Alcal\u00e1. This campus includes most science departments and student housing (as well as its own, separate [[RENFE]] [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Universidad railway station|station]]). The second, central campus, houses most of the humanities and social-science departments, including a law school.\n\nThe architectural influence of the university can be found in other present-day academic institutions. The [[University of San Diego]] is largely based on the Spanish university; its campus and address take the name \"Alcal\u00e1 Park\".  In addition, some buildings at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] were modeled after the architecture of Universidad de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Barrick|first= Nolan\n|title= Texas Tech...

With the patronage of [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros |Cardinal Cisneros]], it was recognized in a 1499 [[papal bull]], and quickly gained international fame as a main centre of learning of the [[Renaissance]] thanks to the production of the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]] in 1517, which is the basis for most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} of the current translations. By royal decree, the university moved to Madrid in 1836 (initially as the Universidad de Madrid, later as the Universidad Central, which in the 1970s would finally be renamed ''[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]''). A new university was founded{{by whom?|date=June 2019}} in the old buildings as the ''[[Universidad de Alcal\u00e1]]'' in 1977. Parts of the new university occupy the buildings of the old Universidad Complutense in the city centre, including the modern Colegio de San Ildefonso, and other ''Colegios'', and the structures have served as a model for other universities across the Spanish territories in the Americas and other dependencies.\n\n[[File:Palacio Laredo (30-06-2007) balc\u00f3n y minarete.jpg|thumb|upright|Laredo Palace]]\nThe university chapel dedicated to Saint Ildefonso has a monument to the university's founder, Cardinal Cisneros, by [[Fancelli]], an Italian sculptor.\n\nAlthough the present university is named \"Universidad de Alcal\u00e1\", the ancient institution founded by Cisneros is the one now called \"Universidad Complutense\", translocated in the capital city of Madrid (\"Complutensis\" is the Latin word for \"native of Alcal\u00e1\"). The modern university is related to the original institution in name only, although it occupies the former buildings of the Complutense.\n\n==Cathedral==\n{{Main article|Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Cathedral}}\n[[File:Alcal\u00e1 de Henares (RPS 09-12-2012) Catedral Magistral de los Santos Justo y Pastor.png|thumb|Cathedral of the Santos Ni\u00f1os]]\nAside from the buildings associated with the university, one of the city's most important and historic building is the Cathedral-Magistral of Saints [[Justus and Pastor]], known formally in Spanish as the \"''Santa e Insigne Catedral-Magistral de los Santos Justo y Pastor''\" or more familiarly as the \"''Catedral de los Santos Ni\u00f1os.''\" Constructed between 1497 and 1514, the Cathedral houses the remains of Saints Justus and Pastor, two Christian schoolboys martyred near the city during the persecutions of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] at the beginning of the 4th century.\n\n[[File:Catedral de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares-Portada.png|thumb|left|The western [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the Cathedral of the Santos Ni\u00f1os, illustrating a \"florid\" or \"[[Isabelline Gothic]]\" style.]]\nIn 414 a chapel was erected at the site of Justus and Pastor's martyrdom, and was converted into a [[Cathedral]] during the period of [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] control of [[Hispania]]; bishops from Alcal\u00e1 were present at the [[Councils of Toledo]] beginning in the 7th century. In 1053 the old city of Alcal\u00e1 (''Alcal\u00e1 la Vieja'') was conquered by  [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand the Great]], only to be recaptured the following year by the Moorish armies then warring for control of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], who destroyed the cathedral as an act of retaliation. At that time the relics of Saints Justus and Pastor were taken to [[Huesca]] for safekeeping until after the reconquest of Alcal\u00e1 in 1118. Although a church was rebuilt on the site in 1122, Pope [[Urban II]], under the influence of his friend [[Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], decided not to restore the Diocese of Alcal\u00e1 at that time. Instead, de Sauvet\u00e2t was able to secure the incorporation of Alcal\u00e1 into his own archiepiscopal territories through a donation from King  [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso VII]] in 1129.\n\nThe church was rebuilt again some three hundred years later by a subsequent Archbishop of Toledo, Alfonso Carrillo de Acu\u00f1a, who elevated it to the status of a [[collegiate church]]. It was finally reconstructed in its present Isabelline Gothic style under Cardinal Cisneros (1495\u20131517), the founder of the university. A tower was added between 1528 and 1582, achieving its modern appearance in 1618. The processional [[cloister]] and the Chapel of Saint Peter were incorporated into the building in the 17th century.\n\nThe building was declared a national monument in 1904. Nevertheless, it was burned during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) and practically all of its contents were destroyed with the exception of a few minor relics and choir seats.\n\n[[File:Cardinal cisneros' tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal Cisneros' tomb, in the cathedral]]\n[[File:Capilla del Oidor.jpg|thumb|Oidor Church]]\nIt was not until 1991 that the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|Diocese of Alcal\u00e1]] was finally restored, being separated from the Archdiocese of Madrid, at which time the building was granted its present status of Cathedral-Magistral. (Although the title \"Magistral\" was originally granted by Cardinal Cisneros, the building was still technically only a Collegiate Church, and not yet a Cathedral within the ecclesiastical meaning of the term.)\n\nThe Cathedral of Alcal\u00e1 is notable as one of only two churches in the world to be granted the special title \"Magistral\" (along with [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven|St. Peter's Church]] in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]). The title reflects its former status as a Collegiate Church, and derives from the requirement that all of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the Cathedral must possess the academic distinction of [[Doctor of Theology]] in order to serve there.\n\nIn addition to that of Saints Justus and Pastor, the Cathedral also houses the tomb of renowned 17th-century Spanish sculptor [[Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez]].\n\n==Other buildings==\nThe city is also home to the Archbishops Palace. This site is where Christopher Columbus and King Ferdinand planned the excursion to the West as well as the birthplace of [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, who would be the first wife of King [[Henry VIII of England]] and therefore Queen consort of [[England]].\n\nAlcal\u00e1's [[Corral de comedias de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|Corral of Comedies]], which hosts a full program of theatre and is open for tours, is the oldest documented corral in the history of Spain.\n\n==The city today==\n[[File:(Alcal\u00e1 de Henares) Madrid ESA354454 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Alcal\u00e1 de Henares as seen by the [[Sentinel-2]] of the [[European Space Agency]].]]\nThe center of the city remains essentially medieval, with many winding cobbled streets, and many historic buildings. The city centre surrounds [[Cervantes]] Square (the famous ''Plaza de Cervantes'') and is traversed by a long pedestrian main street, the ''Calle Mayor''.  The city includes the Moorish quarter, the Jewish quarter, and the Christian quarter.  These distinct neighborhoods have given Alcal\u00e1 the reputation of \"the city of three cultures.\"\n\nThe old city centre has been largely preserved, unlike the suburbs. There has been no clear planning by the city councillors regarding expansion, and the sprawling suburban areas are irregularly constructed, with the addition of 1970s-style high rise blocks in many places.\n\nOne of the most important streets in the city is the ''Calle del Cardenal Cisneros'' which takes tourists from the Madrid Gate at the entrance of the city, to the old city center and the Cathedral in Santos Ni\u00f1os Square. The main park of Alcal\u00e1, Parque Municipal O'Donnell is a major recreational center for city residents and lies along a main road of Alcal\u00e1, V\u00eda Complutense.\n\nRecent archaeological excavations have opened up the city's Roman forum where a large complex comprising a basilica, public baths, a [[cryptoporticus]], a market and a large monumental fa\u00e7ade stands out. Alongside the forum is the Domus with an extraordinary collection of Roman domestic mural paintings. On the outskirts is the House of Hippolytus, an old school. In turn, the Regional Archaeology Museum holds highly valuable mosaics.\n\nThe city hosts a large population of international students due to the presence of the university, and in particular its [[Spanish language]] and literature programs for foreign students.  Alcalingua, a branch of [[University of Alcal\u00e1]], is one of the major foreign language learning centers for students from abroad.\n\n===The storks===\nAlcal\u00e1 is well known for its population of [[white stork]]s.  Their large nests can be observed atop many of the churches and historic buildings in the city, and are themselves a significant tourist attraction. Situated in the lowlands of the [[Henares|Henares river]], the city is an attractive home for the migratory storks due to the wide availability of food and nesting material in the area.\n\nFor over twenty years Alcal\u00e1's storks have been counted and studied, and the active protection and maintenance of their nests is by official policy. Although once in danger of disappearing, with only eleven pairs counted between 1986 and 1987, the population has grown to around 90 resident pairs today, many of which have shortened the distance and duration of their typical migrations to remain in the city nearly all year.<ref>[http://www.ayto-alcaladehenares.es/template2.asp?cat_id=2483&mcat_id=1107&site_language=2&opt=m01_010&mcat=3909 \"''Las cig\u00fce\u00f1as de Alcal\u00e1'' at The City of Alcal\u00e1's official web site (in Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208002217/http://www.ayto-alcaladehenares.es/template2.asp?cat_id=2483&mcat_id=1107&site_language=2&opt=m01_010&mcat=3909 |date=2008-12-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in this city of central Spain is the [[Mediterranean climate|continentalised Mediterranean]], with cold, dry winters and hot, dry summers.

However, the expanding population has forced two new residential areas to be created between the railway and the motorway and beyond the latter. The historical centre lies roughly in the middle of the urban area. It is characterised by lower, [[Spanish Golden Age]] buildings, of which the most lavish belong to the university. These historic buildings gained for the city the title of [[World Heritage Site]], awarded by the [[UNESCO]] in 1998. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nSurrounding it there are the high, swiftly built blocks of the 1960s, during the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] era. They fill spaces to the north up to the railway line and to the west up to where the industrial zone begins. This was erected in the early 1960s and has developed and expanded.

Many [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] businesses have also been established in the city. Alcal\u00e1 has the largest community (18%) of Romanian immigrants in Spain, with over 35,000 people. In 2007, for the first time, the immigrants from Romania created a political party for the elections to come. There is also a festival once a year, celebrated at the city central square (Plaza de Cervantes) dedicated to the people of Romania in Alcal\u00e1.\n\n==Transport==\nAlcal\u00e1's excellent transport links with Madrid have led to its becoming a commuter town, with many of its inhabitants travelling to work in the capital. By Cercanias (railway) is the lines C2 and C7 that links Alcala de Henares with Madrid in 35 minutes, or Guadalajara in 25 minutes, also exists in the peak hours trains called CIVIS, direct train, that makes the journey in 20 minutes. Also it is linked by bus to Madrid, Guadalajara and several towns and villages in nearby.  \nBy car, Alcala de Henares is well linked with the state roads network with the nearby A2, the highway which starts in Madrid and continues on to Barcelona and to France.\nIt was affected particularly badly by the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]] in Madrid as all the bombs were placed on trains that originated in, or passed through, Alcal\u00e1.  There is now a memorial placed at the entrance to the station in remembrance of the victims. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nAlcal\u00e1 also has an intensive bus system called \"Alcal\u00e1-Bus\" which runs to all the major neighborhoods and costs 1,30 euro per ride. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Spain}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\nAlcal\u00e1 de Henares is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*{{flagicon|ROU}} [[Alba Iulia]], [[Romania]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], United States\n*{{flagicon|MEX}} [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]]\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Lublin]], [[Poland]]<ref name=\"Lublin twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lublin.eu/Miasta_partnerskie_Lublina-1-443-3-413_436.html|title=Miasta Partnerskie Lublina|accessdate = 2013-08-07|work=Urz\u0105d Miasta Lublin |language=Polish|trans-title=Lublin - Partnership Cities|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171020/http://lublin.eu/Miasta_partnerskie_Lublina-1-443-3-413_436.html|archivedate=2013-01-16}}</ref>\n||\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Peterborough]], [[United Kingdom]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],  United States\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Talence]], [[France]]\n|}[[Didacus of Alcal\u00e1|Saint Didacus]], known as San Diego in Spanish, was born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and is the namesake for the city of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],  United States.

Straddling the [[Henares River]], it is located {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northeast of the centre of [[Madrid]]. {{As of|2018}}, it has a population of 193,751, making it the region's third most populated [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality]].\n\nPredated by earlier settlements (''[[oppidum|oppida]]'') on the left bank of the Henares, the city has its origins in the ''{{ill|Complutum|es}}'' settlement founded in Roman times on the right bank (North) of the river, that became a bishopric seat in the 5th century. One of the several Muslim citadels in the Middle Mark of [[al-Andalus]] (hence the name ''Alcal\u00e1'', a derivative of the Arabic term for citadel) was established on the left bank, while, after the Christian conquest culminated circa 1118, the bulk of the urban nucleus returned to the right bank. For much of the late middle-ages and the early modern period before becoming part of the province of Madrid, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares was a seigneurial estate of the archbishop of Toledo.\n\nIts historical centre is one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nThe city has a long university tradition. [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]] founded the [[Complutense_University_of_Madrid#History_2|Complutense University]] in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares in the late 15th century. The city currently hosts the (refounded) [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]. It is the native city of [[Miguel de Cervantes]].\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the mayor is {{ill|Javier Rodr\u00edguez Palacios|es}} ([[PSOE]]).<ref name=\"marcos\">{{Cite journal|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2015/06/13/madrid/1434206613_236578.html|journal=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|title=Alcal\u00e1 de Henares vuelve a ser un s\u00edmbolo para el PSOE|first=Jos\u00e9|last=Marcos|date=2015-06-13}}</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nLocally, it is generally known simply as ''Alcal\u00e1'', but ''de Henares'' is appended when needed to differentiate it from a dozen Spanish cities sharing the name [[Alcal\u00e1 (disambiguation)|Alcal\u00e1]] (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629}} {{transl|ar|al-qal\u02bfa}} for fortification or [[citadel]], typically a [[castle]]). The [[Latin]] name, ''Complutum'', is sometimes used.\n\n==History==\nThe city boundaries have been inhabited since the [[Chalcolithic]] phase of the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered the area in the 1st century BC, and built the town of ''Complutum'' near a previous [[Carpetani]]an settlement, called ''Iplacea''. Thus, it became the only Roman town in the Madrid region. With 10,000 inhabitants, it reached the status of ''[[Municipium]]'' and had its own governing institutions. It played an important role, located on the roman road connecting ''[[Emerita Augusta]]'' and ''[[Caesaraugusta]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM002175.pdf|page=12|year=2003|title=La ciudad romana de Complutum.

Torre albarrana de Alcala la Vieja.jpg|thumb|left|Tower of the Old Castle of Alcal\u00e1 La Vieja]]\nWhen the [[Moorish invasion of Iberia|Moors arrived]] in 711, they subdued the Visigothic city and founded another site, building an {{transl|ar|al-qal\u02bfa}}, which means \"citadel\" in Arabic, on a nearby hill, today known as {{lang|es|Alcal\u00e1 la Vieja}} (Old Alcal\u00e1). On 3 May 1118, it was [[Reconquista|reconquered]] by the Archbishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] [[Bernard de Sedirac]] in the name of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. The Christians preferred the ''Burgo de Santiuste'' (\"Saint Just's borough\") on the original Roman site and the Arab one was abandoned. The city was ceded to the Bishopric of Toledo, which granted it ferial rights. Under [[Christians|Christian]] rule until the end of the Reconquista, the city had both a Jewish and a Moorish quarter and a renowned marketplace. Its central position allowed it to be a frequent residence of the [[Kings of Castile]], when travelling south.\n\nAt some time in the 1480s, [[Christopher Columbus]] had his first meeting with the ''[[Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'', [[King Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and his wife [[Queen Isabella I of Castile]], who financed the travel for the ''[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Discovery of America]]''.\n\nThe city suffered severe damage during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n===Historic figures and events===\n[[File:Quijote and Sancho.jpg|thumb|left|Statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza outside Cervantes' birthplace]]\n\nThe author [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, and baptized in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda in 1547, although his family moved from the city when he was still young. The city celebrates his birthday, 9 October, every year and organizes an annual Cervantes festival. \n\n[[File:Paul Gustave Louis Christophe Dor\u00e9 IV.jpg|thumb|[[Miguel de Cervantes]] (the author of) Don Quijote (Don Quixote) illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nEvery year on 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes' death, the city of Alcal\u00e1 hosts the ceremony awarding the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize|Cervantes Prize]], the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]]'s most prestigious award for lifetime achievement in literature. The award is presented by the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] at the University of Alcal\u00e1's historic \"''Colegio de San Ildefonso.''\" Speeches about the importance of the Spanish language are customarily given by the King, the Minister of Culture and the laureate. The ceremony attracts a wide range of dignitaries to the city including members of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister, and others.  During this ceremony the citizens of Alcal\u00e1 can be heard singing the city's song, entitled \"Alcal\u00e1 de Henares.\"\n\nOther notable figures associated with the city are [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]], the mystic [[John of the Cross]], the theologian [[Gabriel V\u00e1zquez Saavedra y Rojas|Gabriel V\u00e1zquez]], the poet [[Juan Ruiz]], Arcipreste de Hita, and [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a D\u00edaz]], writer and politician, who was President of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] between 1936 and 1939. The historian [[Antonio de Sol\u00eds y Ribadeneyra|Antonio de Sol\u00eds]] was also probably born here. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] was once a student at the university, yet after several confrontations with the [[Spanish Inquisition]], he left the city.\n\nAlcal\u00e1 hosts an annual \"Noche en Blanco.\"  During this festival the streets are filled with music, art, theatre, and dance as the city residents celebrate Alcal\u00e1's rich cultural heritage.  The festival goes well into the night and centers around the Plaza de Cervantes where stages are set up to host the performances.\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\n[[File:ComplutumEstaciones.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman mosaic (part of the archeological ensemble of Complutum) representing the four [[season]]s from the House of Bacchus.]]\n[[File:Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Palacio Arzobispal 6045.JPG|thumb|Tower of Tenorio of the [[Archbishop's Palace of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|Archbishop's Palace of Alcal\u00e1]].]]\nThe town of historic importance was one of the first [[Diocese|bishoprics]] founded in Spain.\n\nThe polyglot Bible known as the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]], the first of the many similar Bibles produced during the revival of Biblical studies that took place in the 16th century,  was printed at Alcal\u00e1 under the care of [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]].\n\nA [[papal bull]] of 7 March 1885, united Alcal\u00e1 with (effectively merging it into) the [[diocese of Madrid]], which includes the civil province of Madrid, [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Toledo]]. The bishop's residence has since been used for preserving historical archives. It was designed by [[Alonso Berruguete]] and has a famous staircase.\n\n===Jewish history===\nDuring [[Muslim]] rule, the [[Jewish]] community of the city was granted equal rights as the [[Christians]] living in it. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Jewish congregation of the city paid taxes to the [[Archbishop of Toledo]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00697.html Alcal\u00e1 de Henares<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Jews]] of Alcala were mentioned in the 14th-century Satire by [[Marrano]] [[Pero Ferr\u00fas]]. During the 15th century, the Jewish congregation of the city was one of the largest in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], having about 200 Jewish families. [[Hebrew]] studies at the [[University of Alcala]] were encouraged by Cardinal [[Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros]] during the 16th century, bringing some Jews and [[Marrano]] Hebraists to work in the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The location of the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] of the city is well known &ndash; between Mayor, Santiago, Imagen and Cervantes streets. One [[synagogue]] stood in Carmen Calzado street, no. 10. The other was on Santiago street. After the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]] Jews were requested to become Christians to continue living in Castile and Aragon; those who refused had to leave these kingdoms and most of them found residence in the North of Africa, Amsterdam and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe origins of Miguel de Cervantes' family are supposed (there is no total certainty) to be Jewish. Because his father worked on the former Jewish neighbourhood, the birthplace was close to the workplace, and also because the surname Cervantes makes reference to a different site in the Northwest of Spain, and geographical surnames were common among the Jewish population.\n\n==University==\n{{Main article|University of Alcal\u00e1}}\n[[File:Universidad de Alcala.jpg|thumb|The ''rectorado'' of the [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]]]\nThe major landmark and one of the great prides of the city, its university, uses sites throughout the city, but has two main campuses. The first is on the north side of Alcal\u00e1. This campus includes most science departments and student housing (as well as its own, separate [[RENFE]] [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Universidad railway station|station]]). The second, central campus, houses most of the humanities and social-science departments, including a law school.\n\nThe architectural influence of the university can be found in other present-day academic institutions. The [[University of San Diego]] is largely based on the Spanish university; its campus and address take the name \"Alcal\u00e1 Park\".  In addition, some buildings at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] were modeled after the architecture of Universidad de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Barrick|first= Nolan\n|title= Texas Tech...

With the patronage of [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros |Cardinal Cisneros]], it was recognized in a 1499 [[papal bull]], and quickly gained international fame as a main centre of learning of the [[Renaissance]] thanks to the production of the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]] in 1517, which is the basis for most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} of the current translations. By royal decree, the university moved to Madrid in 1836 (initially as the Universidad de Madrid, later as the Universidad Central, which in the 1970s would finally be renamed ''[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]''). A new university was founded{{by whom?|date=June 2019}} in the old buildings as the ''[[Universidad de Alcal\u00e1]]'' in 1977. Parts of the new university occupy the buildings of the old Universidad Complutense in the city centre, including the modern Colegio de San Ildefonso, and other ''Colegios'', and the structures have served as a model for other universities across the Spanish territories in the Americas and other dependencies.\n\n[[File:Palacio Laredo (30-06-2007) balc\u00f3n y minarete.jpg|thumb|upright|Laredo Palace]]\nThe university chapel dedicated to Saint Ildefonso has a monument to the university's founder, Cardinal Cisneros, by [[Fancelli]], an Italian sculptor.\n\nAlthough the present university is named \"Universidad de Alcal\u00e1\", the ancient institution founded by Cisneros is the one now called \"Universidad Complutense\", translocated in the capital city of Madrid (\"Complutensis\" is the Latin word for \"native of Alcal\u00e1\"). The modern university is related to the original institution in name only, although it occupies the former buildings of the Complutense.\n\n==Cathedral==\n{{Main article|Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Cathedral}}\n[[File:Alcal\u00e1 de Henares (RPS 09-12-2012) Catedral Magistral de los Santos Justo y Pastor.png|thumb|Cathedral of the Santos Ni\u00f1os]]\nAside from the buildings associated with the university, one of the city's most important and historic building is the Cathedral-Magistral of Saints [[Justus and Pastor]], known formally in Spanish as the \"''Santa e Insigne Catedral-Magistral de los Santos Justo y Pastor''\" or more familiarly as the \"''Catedral de los Santos Ni\u00f1os.''\" Constructed between 1497 and 1514, the Cathedral houses the remains of Saints Justus and Pastor, two Christian schoolboys martyred near the city during the persecutions of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] at the beginning of the 4th century.\n\n[[File:Catedral de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares-Portada.png|thumb|left|The western [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the Cathedral of the Santos Ni\u00f1os, illustrating a \"florid\" or \"[[Isabelline Gothic]]\" style.]]\nIn 414 a chapel was erected at the site of Justus and Pastor's martyrdom, and was converted into a [[Cathedral]] during the period of [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] control of [[Hispania]]; bishops from Alcal\u00e1 were present at the [[Councils of Toledo]] beginning in the 7th century. In 1053 the old city of Alcal\u00e1 (''Alcal\u00e1 la Vieja'') was conquered by  [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand the Great]], only to be recaptured the following year by the Moorish armies then warring for control of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], who destroyed the cathedral as an act of retaliation. At that time the relics of Saints Justus and Pastor were taken to [[Huesca]] for safekeeping until after the reconquest of Alcal\u00e1 in 1118. Although a church was rebuilt on the site in 1122, Pope [[Urban II]], under the influence of his friend [[Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], decided not to restore the Diocese of Alcal\u00e1 at that time. Instead, de Sauvet\u00e2t was able to secure the incorporation of Alcal\u00e1 into his own archiepiscopal territories through a donation from King  [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso VII]] in 1129.\n\nThe church was rebuilt again some three hundred years later by a subsequent Archbishop of Toledo, Alfonso Carrillo de Acu\u00f1a, who elevated it to the status of a [[collegiate church]]. It was finally reconstructed in its present Isabelline Gothic style under Cardinal Cisneros (1495\u20131517), the founder of the university. A tower was added between 1528 and 1582, achieving its modern appearance in 1618. The processional [[cloister]] and the Chapel of Saint Peter were incorporated into the building in the 17th century.\n\nThe building was declared a national monument in 1904. Nevertheless, it was burned during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) and practically all of its contents were destroyed with the exception of a few minor relics and choir seats.\n\n[[File:Cardinal cisneros' tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal Cisneros' tomb, in the cathedral]]\n[[File:Capilla del Oidor.jpg|thumb|Oidor Church]]\nIt was not until 1991 that the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|Diocese of Alcal\u00e1]] was finally restored, being separated from the Archdiocese of Madrid, at which time the building was granted its present status of Cathedral-Magistral. (Although the title \"Magistral\" was originally granted by Cardinal Cisneros, the building was still technically only a Collegiate Church, and not yet a Cathedral within the ecclesiastical meaning of the term.)\n\nThe Cathedral of Alcal\u00e1 is notable as one of only two churches in the world to be granted the special title \"Magistral\" (along with [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven|St. Peter's Church]] in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]). The title reflects its former status as a Collegiate Church, and derives from the requirement that all of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the Cathedral must possess the academic distinction of [[Doctor of Theology]] in order to serve there.\n\nIn addition to that of Saints Justus and Pastor, the Cathedral also houses the tomb of renowned 17th-century Spanish sculptor [[Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez]].\n\n==Other buildings==\nThe city is also home to the Archbishops Palace. This site is where Christopher Columbus and King Ferdinand planned the excursion to the West as well as the birthplace of [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, who would be the first wife of King [[Henry VIII of England]] and therefore Queen consort of [[England]].\n\nAlcal\u00e1's [[Corral de comedias de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|Corral of Comedies]], which hosts a full program of theatre and is open for tours, is the oldest documented corral in the history of Spain.\n\n==The city today==\n[[File:(Alcal\u00e1 de Henares) Madrid ESA354454 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Alcal\u00e1 de Henares as seen by the [[Sentinel-2]] of the [[European Space Agency]].]]\nThe center of the city remains essentially medieval, with many winding cobbled streets, and many historic buildings. The city centre surrounds [[Cervantes]] Square (the famous ''Plaza de Cervantes'') and is traversed by a long pedestrian main street, the ''Calle Mayor''.  The city includes the Moorish quarter, the Jewish quarter, and the Christian quarter.  These distinct neighborhoods have given Alcal\u00e1 the reputation of \"the city of three cultures.\"\n\nThe old city centre has been largely preserved, unlike the suburbs. There has been no clear planning by the city councillors regarding expansion, and the sprawling suburban areas are irregularly constructed, with the addition of 1970s-style high rise blocks in many places.\n\nOne of the most important streets in the city is the ''Calle del Cardenal Cisneros'' which takes tourists from the Madrid Gate at the entrance of the city, to the old city center and the Cathedral in Santos Ni\u00f1os Square. The main park of Alcal\u00e1, Parque Municipal O'Donnell is a major recreational center for city residents and lies along a main road of Alcal\u00e1, V\u00eda Complutense.\n\nRecent archaeological excavations have opened up the city\u2019s Roman forum where a large complex comprising a basilica, public baths, a [[cryptoporticus]], a market and a large monumental fa\u00e7ade stands out. Alongside the forum is the Domus with an extraordinary collection of Roman domestic mural paintings. On the outskirts is the House of Hippolytus, an old school. In turn, the Regional Archaeology Museum holds highly valuable mosaics.\n\nThe city hosts a large population of international students due to the presence of the university, and in particular its [[Spanish language]] and literature programs for foreign students.  Alcalingua, a branch of [[University of Alcal\u00e1]], is one of the major foreign language learning centers for students from abroad.\n\n===The storks===\nAlcal\u00e1 is well known for its population of [[white stork]]s.  Their large nests can be observed atop many of the churches and historic buildings in the city, and are themselves a significant tourist attraction. Situated in the lowlands of the [[Henares|Henares river]], the city is an attractive home for the migratory storks due to the wide availability of food and nesting material in the area.\n\nFor over twenty years Alcal\u00e1's storks have been counted and studied, and the active protection and maintenance of their nests is by official policy. Although once in danger of disappearing, with only eleven pairs counted between 1986 and 1987, the population has grown to around 90 resident pairs today, many of which have shortened the distance and duration of their typical migrations to remain in the city nearly all year.<ref>[http://www.ayto-alcaladehenares.es/template2.asp?cat_id=2483&mcat_id=1107&site_language=2&opt=m01_010&mcat=3909 \"''Las cig\u00fce\u00f1as de Alcal\u00e1'' at The City of Alcal\u00e1's official web site (in Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208002217/http://www.ayto-alcaladehenares.es/template2.asp?cat_id=2483&mcat_id=1107&site_language=2&opt=m01_010&mcat=3909 |date=2008-12-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in this city of central Spain is the [[Mediterranean climate|continentalised Mediterranean]], with cold, dry winters and hot, dry summers.

However, the expanding population has forced two new residential areas to be created between the railway and the motorway and beyond the latter. The historical centre lies roughly in the middle of the urban area. It is characterised by lower, [[Spanish Golden Age]] buildings, of which the most lavish belong to the university. These historic buildings gained for the city the title of [[World Heritage Site]], awarded by the [[UNESCO]] in 1998. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nSurrounding it there are the high, swiftly built blocks of the 1960s, during the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] era. They fill spaces to the north up to the railway line and to the west up to where the industrial zone begins. This was erected in the early 1960s and has developed and expanded. Now it occupies more than a third of the city's area being cut by the railway and motorway. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Immigration==\nSome 18% of the population are of foreign origin, according to the official data, a large part of the newcomers (30%) are immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. Many [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] businesses have also been established in the city. Alcal\u00e1 has the largest community (18%) of Romanian immigrants in Spain, with over 35,000 people. In 2007, for the first time, the immigrants from Romania created a political party for the elections to come. There is also a festival once a year, celebrated at the city central square (Plaza de Cervantes) dedicated to the people of Romania in Alcal\u00e1.\n\n==Transport==\nAlcal\u00e1's excellent transport links with Madrid have led to its becoming a commuter town, with many of its inhabitants travelling to work in the capital. By Cercanias (railway) is the lines C2 and C7 that links Alcala de Henares with Madrid in 35 minutes, or Guadalajara in 25 minutes, also exists in the peak hours trains called CIVIS, direct train, that makes the journey in 20 minutes. Also it is linked by bus to Madrid, Guadalajara and several towns and villages in nearby.  \nBy car, Alcala de Henares is well linked with the state roads network with the nearby A2, the highway which starts in Madrid and continues on to Barcelona and to France.\nIt was affected particularly badly by the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]] in Madrid as all the bombs were placed on trains that originated in, or passed through, Alcal\u00e1.  There is now a memorial placed at the entrance to the station in remembrance of the victims. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nAlcal\u00e1 also has an intensive bus system called \"Alcal\u00e1-Bus\" which runs to all the major neighborhoods and costs 1,30 euro per ride. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Spain}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\nAlcal\u00e1 de Henares is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*{{flagicon|ROU}} [[Alba Iulia]], [[Romania]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], United States\n*{{flagicon|MEX}} [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]]\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Lublin]], [[Poland]]<ref name=\"Lublin twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lublin.eu/Miasta_partnerskie_Lublina-1-443-3-413_436.html|title=Miasta Partnerskie Lublina|accessdate = 2013-08-07|work=Urz\u0105d Miasta Lublin |language=Polish|trans-title=Lublin - Partnership Cities|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171020/http://lublin.eu/Miasta_partnerskie_Lublina-1-443-3-413_436.html|archivedate=2013-01-16}}</ref>\n||\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Peterborough]], [[United Kingdom]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],  United States\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Talence]], [[France]]\n|}[[Didacus of Alcal\u00e1|Saint Didacus]], known as San Diego in Spanish, was born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and is the namesake for the city of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],  United States.

The (\u00b1)-''cis'' isomers are the form used [[Recreational drug|recreationally]].\nThe (\u00b1)-''cis'' isomers [racemate (1:1-mixture) of the (4''R'',5''S'')-isomer and the enantiomeric (4''S'',5''R'')-isomer] generally synthesized from [[phenylpropanolamine|dl-phenylpropanolamine]] in one step by [[cyclization]] with [[cyanogen bromide]] (sometimes prepared ''[[In situ#Chemistry|in situ]]'' by reacting [[sodium cyanide]] with [[bromine]]). Alternate synthesis routes generally involve more steps, such as replacing cyanogen bromide with sodium or potassium [[cyanate]] to form an intermediate and then reacting it with concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]. A method reported in microgram replaced the need for a separate addition of [[hydrochloric acid]] by starting with the hydrochloride salt of the [[phenylpropanolamine|dl-phenylpropanolamine]] but side-products are noted. The (\u00b1)-''trans'' isomers [racemate (1:1-mixture) of the (4''S'',5''S'')-isomer and the enantiomeric (4''R'',5''R'')-isomer] are synthesized in the same manner above but [[norephedrine|dl-norephedrine]] is used as the starting material instead. The cyanate reaction proceeds differently from the cyanogen bromide and transforms norephedrine into trans-4-methylaminorex instead, as noted in the DEA micrograph. The cyanogen bromide, by comparison, transformed norephedrine into the cis isomer and norpseudoephedrine into the trans isomers of the final product.\n\n==Dosage==\n\n4-methylaminorex can be smoked, [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] or taken orally.\n\nAs an [[anorectic]], the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED50]] is 8.8&nbsp;mg/kg in rats for the (\u00b1)-''cis'' isomers. The (\u00b1)-''trans'' isomers are slightly more potent at 7.0&nbsp;mg/kg.

The (\u00b1)-''cis'' isomers are the form used [[Recreational drug|recreationally]].\nThe (\u00b1)-''cis'' isomers [racemate (1:1-mixture) of the (4''R'',5''S'')-isomer and the enantiomeric (4''S'',5''R'')-isomer] generally synthesized from [[phenylpropanolamine|dl-phenylpropanolamine]] in one step by [[cyclization]] with [[cyanogen bromide]] (sometimes prepared ''[[In situ#Chemistry|in situ]]'' by reacting [[sodium cyanide]] with [[bromine]]). Alternate synthesis routes generally involve more steps, such as replacing cyanogen bromide with sodium or potassium [[cyanate]] to form an intermediate and then reacting it with concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]. A method reported in microgram replaced the need for a separate addition of [[hydrochloric acid]] by starting with the hydrochloride salt of the [[phenylpropanolamine|dl-phenylpropanolamine]] but side-products are noted. The (\u00b1)-''trans'' isomers [racemate (1:1-mixture) of the (4''S'',5''S'')-isomer and the enantiomeric (4''R'',5''R'')-isomer] are synthesized in the same manner above but [[norephedrine|dl-norephedrine]] is used as the starting material instead. The cyanate reaction proceeds differently from the cyanogen bromide and transforms norephedrine into trans-4-methylaminorex instead, as noted in the DEA micrograph. The cyanogen bromide, by comparison, transformed norephedrine into the cis isomer and norpseudoephedrine into the trans isomers of the final product.\n\n==Dosage==\n\n4-methylaminorex can be smoked, [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] or taken orally.\n\nAs an [[anorectic]], the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED50]] is 8.8&nbsp;mg/kg in rats for the (\u00b1)-''cis'' isomers.

However, studies revealing the abuse potential of the 'trans' isomer,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} coupled with the development of new clandestine synthetic methods that would produce the ''trans''{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} created a potential loophole in the law, which covered only the 'cis' isomer. To clarify the situation, the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] published a paper in its [[DEA Microgram Journal]], regarding interpretation of the relevant statutory law as it relates to the status of ''trans''-4-methylaminorex. In summary, according to this non-legally binding decision, ''trans''-4-methylaminorex is not currently a controlled substance, but a potential analogue. In fact, the report explicitly states:\n{{quote|The United States [Drug Enforcement Administration] has the following opinion on the legality of the positional isomer \"trans\"-4-methylaminorex, which, unlike its 'cis' isomer was never placed in any schedule under the [[Controlled Substances Act]].}}\nHowever, the opinion does say that the agency considers the substance a potential [[controlled substance analog]]ue, making the substance identical to a Schedule I substance if intended for human consumption, according to the [[Federal Analogue Act]].
