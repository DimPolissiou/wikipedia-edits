G. Wodehouse]], and features the young gentleman [[Bertie Wooster]] and his valet [[Jeeves]]. The story was published in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in the United States in February 1916, and in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' in the United Kingdom in June 1916, as \"'''Leave it to Jeeves'''\". The story was also included in the 1925 collection ''[[Carry On, Jeeves]]''.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe story takes place in New York. The artist Corky, a friend of Bertie's, wants to get approval from his uncle to marry his fianc\u00e9e Muriel. To help Corky, Jeeves proposes a plan that involves books about American birds.\n\n==Plot==\n\nBertie is in New York. His friend, Bruce \"Corky\" Corcoran, a struggling artist, relies on an allowance from his rich uncle Alexander Worple, who runs a jute business. Corky introduces his fianc\u00e9e, Muriel Singer, to Bertie. Corky is afraid that his disagreeable uncle will not approve of her. At Bertie's bidding, Jeeves suggests that, since Mr. Worple wrote a book about birds called \"American Birds\", Muriel should write \"The Children's Book of American Birds\" and dedicate it to Mr. Worple, and then send Worple a letter thanking him for his work and asking to meet him. Muriel does not feel she can write a book, so Jeeves proposes they pay a [[ghostwriter]]. To help Corky and Muriel, Bertie pays to have the book published and written. Worple replies to Muriel's letter that he would be happy to meet her.\n\nBertie leaves town for several months to be with friends in the country. He returns to New York and spots Muriel in a restaurant. She has married Alexander Worple. Shocked, Bertie returns to his flat and tells Jeeves, though Jeeves is not surprised, having known this was a possibility. Bertie, uneasy about seeing Corky after this, avoids Corky, but eventually visits Corky after reading in the paper that Muriel and Worple have had a son. Bertie learns that Corky has been commissioned by his uncle to paint a picture of the baby. The situation is terrible for Corky, but he has no choice.\n\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     =  \"I've got through the mere outward appearance, and have put the child's soul on canvas.\"<br/>\"But could a child of that age have a soul like that?

Bertie finds it ugly. Corky believes he has painted the soul of his model. Worple arrives and is appalled by the painting, calling it an extract from a comic supplement. He ends Corky's allowance, leaving Corky distraught. Jeeves, taking inspiration from Worple's comment, believes that the picture could be the foundation for a series of comedic drawings, and suggests the title \"The Adventures of Baby Blobbs\".

The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns.

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], the last other major candidate in the Democratic primary, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden and Trump are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive nominees in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, Biden will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic spread in the United States, and the subsequent effects like the stay-at-home order and social distancing guidelines by local governments, all presidential candidates are unable to hold campaign rallies and public gathering.

W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media.

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form since 1999.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otterson|first=Joe|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|twenty-first season]] (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season premiered on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television. The U.S. ''Millionaire'' won seven [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, and ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it No. 6 in its 2013 list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Core rules===\n[[File:Wales on millionaire.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screenshot illustrating how question text and answer choices appear on-screen]]\nAt its core, the game is a quiz competition in which the goal is to correctly answer a series of fifteen consecutive multiple-choice questions. The questions are of increasing difficulty, with each question worth a specified amount of money that increases in value. If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced to nothing, unless they reach one of two guaranteed money thresholds at question five and ten. If a contestant has difficulty answering a question, they have the option of soliciting one or more of a selection of Lifelines, which will aid them in some way. At any point, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008; 2020-) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows, and was removed again in the 2020 reboot. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008. In the 2020 reboot, the original money staircase was restored.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135: 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310: 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314: 45 seconds\n* Question 15: 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe clock would start as soon as all four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning either of these prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years, all less taxes.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nFrom 2017\u20132019, contestants who answered one of the first five questions incorrectly received a $1,000 consolation prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Official Rules (Archive)|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|accessdate=24 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629022556/http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|archivedate=June 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On the original primetime version and in earlier seasons of the syndicated version prior to 2010, contestants who missed one of the first five questions left with no winnings.\n\n===Lifelines===\nForms of assistance known as \"lifelines\" are available for a contestant to use if a question proves difficult. Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019; 2020): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AIM (software)|AIM]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call via [[Skype]], and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Ask the Host''' (2020): Introduced during the 2020 season, this lifeline allows the contestant to ask for the host's advice on the current question and give the best possible answer.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010; 2020): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend (via [[AT&T]] in ABC airings, except for ''Super Millionaire'' airings, until 2009) and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n* The 2020 season features a lifeline similar to +1. This lifeline is offered to the contestant after the tenth question and allows them to consult with their accompanying supporter one time during the final five questions. However, in order to obtain this lifeline, the contestant must exchange one of his or her other remaining lifelines. (The contestant has unlimited access to their supporter for the first ten questions.)\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOver the course of the program's history, twelve people answered the final question correctly and walked away with the top prize:  \n*[[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]] \u2013 Became the first winner of the top prize on November 19, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taxman scoops a million|work=BBC News|date=November 21, 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/529186.stm|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=PeopleMillionaires>{{cite magazine |url=http://people.com/archive/millionaire-makeovers-vol-54-no-20/|title=Millionaire Makeovers!|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|volume=54 |number=20|date=November 13, 2000|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n*Dan Blonsky \u2013 Won on January 18, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Joe Trela \u2013 Won on  March 23, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Bob House \u2013 Won on June 13, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kim Hunt \u2013 Won on July 6, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*David Goodman \u2013 Won on July 11, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kevin Olmstead \u2013 Won the top prize on April 10, 2001; however, because of the jackpot having been set to increase by $10,000 each episode, he won $2,180,000 \u2013 making him the biggest winner in television history at the time.<ref name=Jackpot>{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=April 11, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*Bernie Cullen \u2013 Won the top prize just five days after Olmstead's win on April 15, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2001/04/16/improbably-millionaire-strikes-again/ |title=Improbably, ''Millionaire'' Strikes Again|work=[[New York Post]]|last=Kaplan|first=Don|date=April 16, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n*Ed Toutant \u2013 Won on September 7, 2001.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit.

At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref name=\"New set\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n===ABC===\nThe U.S. version of ''Millionaire'' was launched by ABC as a half-hour primetime program on August 16, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/broadcast/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-for-ten-year-anniversary/24432/|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Returns for its Ten Year Anniversary|work=[[TV By the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize to contestants.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November.<ref name=\"Far from\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/arts/television/09cart.html?pagewanted=all|title=''Millionaire'' Far From Its Final Answer|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref> The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000<ref>{{citation|title=Disney Factbook 2000 \u2013 Year in Review|author=Walt Disney Company|date=February 5, 2001|page=7}}</ref> and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title=\"ABC Hopes \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" Lightning Can Strike Twice\" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Twenty One (game show)#2000|Twenty One]]'', etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as ''[[Winning Lines (American game show)|Winning Lines]]'', ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'').\n\nThe nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept.

As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for ''Super Millionaire'' were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and '''$10,000,000'''.\n\nContestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip.<ref name=SuperMillionaire/> The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former ''Millionaire'' contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to answer a question. Once used, the contestant must answer the question without using any further lifelines; moreover, if the \"first final answer\" was incorrect, the contestant could ''not'' walk away. If the \"second final answer\" was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.\n\n===''10th Anniversary Celebration''===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''Millionaire''{{'}}s U.S. debut, the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven-night event hosted by Philbin, which aired from August 9 to 23, 2009.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-with-a-hollywood-makeover-74474/|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Returns With A Hollywood Makeover|publisher=AccessHollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 economic crisis]] helped boost interest of renewal of the game show.<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/>\n\nThe episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants.

With a time of 4:39 (45 seconds + 3:54 banked time), Basin was given a question involving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]]'s fondness for [[Fresca]]. Using his one remaining lifeline, Basin asked the audience, which supported his own hunch of [[Yoo-hoo]] rather than the correct answer. He decided to answer the question and lost $475,000, becoming the first contestant in the U.S. version to answer a $1,000,000 question incorrectly.

Deciding that six-plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize, producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner.<ref>{{Cite episode|season=8|number=1|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|network=Syndicated|date=September 7, 2009}}</ref> For the first nine weeks of the 2009\u201310 season, each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what was referred to as the \"Tournament of Ten\". Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the primetime reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Far from\"/>\n\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire'' also made catchphrases out of various lines used on the show. In particular, ''\"Is that your final answer?\"'', asked by ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hosts whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified, was popularized by Philbin during his tenure as host,<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> and was also included on [[TV Land]]'s special \"100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases\", which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger.

Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire now on Facebook: Compete with others for virtual riches|url=https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|last=Shaul|first=Brandy|publisher=AOL|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043122/https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|archivedate=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Album===\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Album (Celador Records), by [[Keith Strachan]], [[Matthew Strachan]], and various artists, was released August 1, 2000 and features songs based on the show.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keith Strachan & Matthew Strachan \u2013 Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (The Album) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Keith-Strachan-Matthew-Strachan-Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Millionaire-The-Album/release/3958022 |website=Discogs |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It!

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form since 1999.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otterson|first=Joe|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|twenty-first season]] (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season premiered on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television.

If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite press release|url= https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/syndicated-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-premieres-new-season-september-13/|title=Syndicated ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Premieres New Season September 13|author= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008; since 2020) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows, in which it was removed again in the 2020 reboot. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008. In the 2020 reboot, a new lifeline was added called \"Ask The Host\", in which the host, Jimmy Kimmel, gives the player the best possible answer and some advice.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning either of these prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years, all less taxes.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nFrom 2017\u20132019, contestants who answered one of the first five questions incorrectly received a $1,000 consolation prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Official Rules (Archive)|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|accessdate=24 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629022556/http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|archivedate=June 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On the original primetime version and in earlier seasons of the syndicated version prior to 2010, contestants who missed one of the first five questions left with no winnings.\n\n===Lifelines===\nForms of assistance known as \"lifelines\" are available for a contestant to use if a question proves difficult. Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019; 2020): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AIM (software)|AIM]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call via [[Skype]], and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Ask the Host''' (2020): Introduced during the 2020 season, this lifeline allows the contestant to ask for the host's advice on the current question and give the best possible answer.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010; 2020): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend (via [[AT&T]] in ABC airings, except for ''Super Millionaire'' airings, until 2009) and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n* The 2020 season features a lifeline similar to +1.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who failed the test were eliminated, while those who passed were interviewed for an audition by the production staff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2003638513_tvgameshowaudition28.html|title=Who wants to be a game-show contestant?|first=Claudia|last=Perry|date=March 28, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and those who impressed the staff the most were then notified by postal mail that they had been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref name=\"New set\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n===ABC===\nThe U.S. version of ''Millionaire'' was launched by ABC as a half-hour primetime program on August 16, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/broadcast/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-for-ten-year-anniversary/24432/|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Returns for its Ten Year Anniversary|work=[[TV By the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize to contestants.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November.<ref name=\"Far from\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/arts/television/09cart.html?pagewanted=all|title=''Millionaire'' Far From Its Final Answer|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref> The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000<ref>{{citation|title=Disney Factbook 2000 \u2013 Year in Review|author=Walt Disney Company|date=February 5, 2001|page=7}}</ref> and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title=\"ABC Hopes \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" Lightning Can Strike Twice\" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Twenty One (game show)#2000|Twenty One]]'', etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as ''[[Winning Lines (American game show)|Winning Lines]]'', ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'').\n\nThe nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television. In the 1999\u20132000 season, it averaged No. 1 in the ratings against all other television shows,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/recent_data/1999-00.html|title=TV Ratings 1999\u20132000|publisher=fbibler.chez.com|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> with 28,848,000 viewers.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The two sides eventually agreed on terms for renewal, which included a return to the original question format (but with fourteen questions) and cuts to the production budget, which resulted in the series leaving New York for [[Stamford, Connecticut]] (although this had been done in 2014) and later moving to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anotado|first=Cory|url=http://www.buzzerblog.com/2015/06/29/millionaire-re-introduces-ladder-format-for-2015-season/|title=Millionaire re-introduces ladder format for 2015 season|work=Buzzerblog|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Had the show not been renewed, SPE was going to place the show on extended hiatus for three years, after which it would reclaim full rights to the show and be free to shop the revived show to another network or syndicator.

When ''FABlife'' failed to gain an audience and was cancelled at midseason, ''Millionaire'' was able to return to many of its former airing tines for 2016; beginning that year, ''Millionaire'' and the viral video show ''[[RightThisMinute]]'' began being sold as a package to ABC stations. \n\nOn January 17, 2017, it was announced that ''Millionaire'' has been renewed through 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' & ''RightThisMinute'' Renewed For Syndication On ABC Stations Through 2018|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/millionaire-rightthisminute-renewed-through-2018-on-abc-channels-1201884820/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=PMC|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> Millionaire was subsequently renewed through the 2018\u201319 season on January 17, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-renews-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-17th-season-1075368|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Renewed for 17th Season on ABC Stations|last=Sandberg|first=Bryn Elise|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 17, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the seventeenth season progressed, the future of ''Millionaire'' became uncertain.

As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for ''Super Millionaire'' were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and '''$10,000,000'''.\n\nContestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip.<ref name=SuperMillionaire/> The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former ''Millionaire'' contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to answer a question. Once used, the contestant must answer the question without using any further lifelines; moreover, if the \"first final answer\" was incorrect, the contestant could ''not'' walk away. If the \"second final answer\" was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.\n\n===''10th Anniversary Celebration''===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''Millionaire''{{'}}s U.S. debut, the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven-night event hosted by Philbin, which aired from August 9 to 23, 2009.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-with-a-hollywood-makeover-74474/|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Returns With A Hollywood Makeover|publisher=AccessHollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 economic crisis]] helped boost interest of renewal of the game show.<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/>\n\nThe episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants.

Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set.

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it.

However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help.

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

This is left unspecified by the macroscopic description.\n\nIn [[information theory]], ''entropy'' is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as ''Shannon entropy''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roger |last=Balian |chapter=Entropy, a Protean concept|editor-last=Dalibard|editor-first=Jean|title=Poincar\u00e9 Seminar 2003: Bose-Einstein condensation \u2013 entropy|year=2004|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-7116-6|pages=119\u2013144}}</ref> Shannon entropy is a broad and general concept used in information theory as well as [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. It was originally devised by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities ''p<sub>i</sub> so that\n:<math>H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \\log p(x_i).</math>\n\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \\Lambda_{ij}, U_0,  t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S.

The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"]. In Probabilities in Physics; Beisbart C. and Hartmann, S.\nEds; Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010</ref> This definition assumes that the basis set of states has been picked so that there is no information on their relative phases. In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \\Lambda_{ij}, U_0,  t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S.

The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].
