By developing a new territorial culture, the Council of Europe seeks to promote populations\u2019 quality of life and well-being.\n\nThe European Landscape Convention introduced a Europe-wide concept centring on the quality of landscape protection, management and planning and covering the entire territory, not just outstanding landscapes.  Through its ground-breaking approach and its broader scope, it complements the [[Council of Europe]]\u2019s and [[UNESCO]]\u2019s heritage conventions.\n\nAfter the 6th Conference of Parties held in [[Strasbourg]] in 3\u20134 May 2011, the current president of conference is selected as Portugal and vice-chair as Turkey.\n\n==Structure==\n(The following is a summary of the full text, which is available from the Council of Europe<ref>full text of [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm European Landscape Convention]</ref>)\n\nThe convention consists of the preamble and eighteen articles divided into four chapters.\n* Chapter I   - General provisions - Art. 1 - 3;\n* Chapter II  - National measures - Art. 4 - 6;\n* Chapter III - European co-operation - Art. 7 - 11;\n* Chapter IV  - Final clauses - Art. 12 - 18.\n\n===Preamble===\nThe preamble to the convention states, inter alia, that the landscape:\n*is a key element of individual and social well-being;\n*contributes to the formation of local cultures and that it is a basic component of the European natural and cultural heritage;\n*is an important part of the quality of life for people everywhere.\nMoreover, it states that the convention is a response to the public\u2019s wish to enjoy high quality landscapes and to play an active part in their development.\n\n===Articles===\n''Article 1'' provides a definition of '[[landscape]]'. For the purposes of the convention it is an area whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors.\nIt also defines 'landscape protection' as actions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape and 'Landscape management' as an action ensuring the regular upkeep of a landscape, so as to guide and harmonise changes within. Finally \"landscape planning\" is defined as a strong forward-looking action to enhance, restore or create landscapes.<ref name=\"Convention1\">[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm European Landscape Convention], Art. 1.</ref>\n\n''Article 2'' denotes the territorial and functional scope of the treaty. It covers:\n*natural, rural, urban and peri-urban areas;\n*land, inland water and marine areas\n*landscapes that might be considered outstanding as well as everyday or degraded landscapes.\nIt also states, with the exception of Art. 15 that convention applies to the entire territory of the Parties.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 2.</ref>\n\n''Article 3'' provides that the aims of the treaty are to promote landscape protection, management and planning, and to organise European co-operation on landscape issues.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 3.</ref>\n\n''Article 5 and 6'' state the general and specific obligations of the Parties, such as:\n*establishing and implementing landscape policies aimed at landscape protection, management and planning\n*integrating landscape into their regional, town planning, cultural, environmental, agricultural, social and economic policies.\n*increasing awareness of the value of landscapes, their role and changes to them\n*promoting training and education in landscape policy, protection, management and planning\n*identifying and assessing the landscapes in their territories.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 5 and 6.</ref>\n\n''Articles 7 \u2013 9'' concern the international co-operation, assistance, exchange of the specialists and information, and encourage Parties to prepare and implement joint landscape programmes.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 7-9.</ref>\n\n''Article 11'' denotes the Landscape Award of the Council of Europe (see below).<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 11.</ref>\n\n''Article 15'' allows Parties to specify the territory to which they want the Convention to apply. This article has been used by ''e.g.'' by Denmark to exclude the treaty's application to Greenland.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 15.</ref>\n\n''Article 16'' gives any Party permission to denounce the convention, at any time, by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 16.</ref>\n\n==Relation to other treaties==\n\nThe European Landscape Convention is an international-level legal text that addresses the protection and management of natural and cultural heritage, and regional and spatial planning. It is complementary to other international treaties, such as:\n*the UNESCO [[Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]], (Paris, 16 November 1972);\n*the Council of Europe Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, (Bern, 19 September 1979);\n*the Council of Europe [[Convention for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe|Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe]], (Granada, 3 October 1985);\n*the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (revised) (Valletta, 16 January 1992).<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Reports/Html/176.htm Explanatory Report], Art. 33.</ref>\n\nThe definition of 'landscape' in the European Landscape Convention is wider than that of 'cultural landscape' in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention; the former includes any kind of landscape while the latter denotes sites of outstanding universal value that have been identified as [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref name=\"unesco\">[https://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext], World Heritage Convention.</ref>\n\n==Landscape Award of the Council of Europe==\nArticle 11 of the convention establishes the Landscape award of the Council of Europe.

By developing a new territorial culture, the Council of Europe seeks to promote populations\u2019 quality of life and well-being.\n\nThe European Landscape Convention introduced a Europe-wide concept centring on the quality of landscape protection, management and planning and covering the entire territory, not just outstanding landscapes.  Through its ground-breaking approach and its broader scope, it complements the [[Council of Europe]]\u2019s and [[UNESCO]]\u2019s heritage conventions.\n\nAfter the 6th Conference of Parties held in [[Strasbourg]] in 3\u20134 May 2011, the current president of conference is selected as Portugal and vice-chair as Turkey.\n\n==Structure==\n(The following is a summary of the full text, which is available from the Council of Europe<ref>full text of [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm European Landscape Convention]</ref>)\n\nThe convention consists of the preamble and eighteen articles divided into four chapters.\n* Chapter I   - General provisions - Art. 1 - 3;\n* Chapter II  - National measures - Art. 4 - 6;\n* Chapter III - European co-operation - Art. 7 - 11;\n* Chapter IV  - Final clauses - Art. 12 - 18.\n\n===Preamble===\nThe preamble to the convention states, inter alia, that the landscape:\n*is a key element of individual and social well-being;\n*contributes to the formation of local cultures and that it is a basic component of the European natural and cultural heritage;\n*is an important part of the quality of life for people everywhere.\nMoreover, it states that the convention is a response to the public\u2019s wish to enjoy high quality landscapes and to play an active part in their development.\n\n===Articles===\n''Article 1'' provides a definition of '[[landscape]]'. For the purposes of the convention it is an area whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors.\nIt also defines 'landscape protection' as actions to conserve and maintain the significant or characteristic features of a landscape and 'Landscape management' as an action ensuring the regular upkeep of a landscape, so as to guide and harmonise changes within. Finally \"landscape planning\" is defined as a strong forward-looking action to enhance, restore or create landscapes.<ref name=\"Convention1\">[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm European Landscape Convention], Art. 1.</ref>\n\n''Article 2'' denotes the territorial and functional scope of the treaty. It covers:\n*natural, rural, urban and peri-urban areas;\n*land, inland water and marine areas\n*landscapes that might be considered outstanding as well as everyday or degraded landscapes.\nIt also states, with the exception of Art. 15 that convention applies to the entire territory of the Parties.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 2.</ref>\n\n''Article 3'' provides that the aims of the treaty are to promote landscape protection, management and planning, and to organise European co-operation on landscape issues.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 3.</ref>\n\n''Article 5 and 6'' state the general and specific obligations of the Parties, such as:\n*establishing and implementing landscape policies aimed at landscape protection, management and planning\n*integrating landscape into their regional, town planning, cultural, environmental, agricultural, social and economic policies.\n*increasing awareness of the value of landscapes, their role and changes to them\n*promoting training and education in landscape policy, protection, management and planning\n*identifying and assessing the landscapes in their territories.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 5 and 6.</ref>\n\n''Articles 7 \u2013 9'' concern the international co-operation, assistance, exchange of the specialists and information, and encourage Parties to prepare and implement joint landscape programmes.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 7-9.</ref>\n\n''Article 11'' denotes the Landscape Award of the Council of Europe (see below).<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 11.</ref>\n\n''Article 15'' allows Parties to specify the territory to which they want the Convention to apply. This article has been used by ''e.g.'' by Denmark to exclude the treaty's application to Greenland.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 15.</ref>\n\n''Article 16'' gives any Party permission to denounce the convention, at any time, by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/176.htm op. cit.], Art. 16.</ref>\n\n==Relation to other treaties==\n\nThe European Landscape Convention is an international-level legal text that addresses the protection and management of natural and cultural heritage, and regional and spatial planning. It is complementary to other international treaties, such as:\n*the UNESCO [[Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]], (Paris, 16 November 1972);\n*the Council of Europe Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, (Bern, 19 September 1979);\n*the Council of Europe [[Convention for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe|Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe]], (Granada, 3 October 1985);\n*the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (revised) (Valletta, 16 January 1992).<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Reports/Html/176.htm Explanatory Report], Art. 33.</ref>\n\nThe definition of 'landscape' in the European Landscape Convention is wider than that of 'cultural landscape' in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention; the former includes any kind of landscape while the latter denotes sites of outstanding universal value that have been identified as [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref name=\"unesco\">[https://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext], World Heritage Convention.</ref>\n\n==Landscape Award of the Council of Europe==\nArticle 11 of the convention establishes the Landscape award of the Council of Europe.

It emerged from a series of hybrid [[Viking]]/[[Gaels|Gaelic]] rulers of the west coast and islands of [[Scotland]] in the [[Middle Ages]], who wielded sea-power with fleets of [[galley]]s ([[birlinn]]s). Although they were, at times, nominal [[vassal]]s of the [[Kings of Norway]], [[High King of Ireland|Ireland]], or [[King of Scotland|Scotland]], the island chiefs remained functionally independent for many centuries. Their territory included the [[Hebrides]] ([[Isle of Skye|Skye]] and [[Ross-shire|Ross]] from 1438), [[Knoydart]], [[Ardnamurchan]], and the [[Kintyre]] peninsula. At their height they were the greatest landowners and most powerful lords in Britain after the [[Kings of England]] and Scotland.<ref>At their height the Lords of the Isles were thus of comparable power to the [[Geraldines]] or perhaps even the [[O'Neill dynasty]] of Late Medieval Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe end of the [[Clan Donald|MacDonald Lords]] came in 1493 when [[John MacDonald II|MacDonald II]] had his ancestral homeland, estates, and titles seized by King [[James IV of Scotland]]. Since that time, the MacDonald Clan has contested the right of James IV to the Lordship of the Isles and uprisings and rebellions against the Scottish Monarch were common. More recently, the Lordship of the Isles has been held by the [[Duke of Rothesay]], the eldest son and heir apparent of the King of Scotland, a title which, since the creation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], is borne by the [[Prince of Wales]]. Thus [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] is the current Lord of the Isles. \n\n[[Finlaggan]] on [[Islay]] was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under [[Clan Donald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlaggan.org/|title=Finlaggan, Islay: The Centre of the Lords of the Isles|publisher=Finlaggan Trust|date=2015|accessdate=2018-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Armorials==\nThe arms adopted by the Lord of the Isles varied over time, but the blazon given and illustrated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.appletonstudios.com/2011_02_01_archive.html|title=Heraldry|publisher=}}</ref> in \"The Lyndsay of the Mount Armorial\" (1542) is: ''Or, an eagle displayed gules beaked sable, over all a lymphad sable''.\n\n==Background==\n{{original research section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Image:Diocese of the Isles, circa 1300 (map 2).png|thumb|upright|The Norwegian [[Diocese of the Isles]], which aligns with lands that formed the Norwegian Kingdom of the Isles]]\nThe west coast and islands of present-day Scotland were those of a people or peoples of uncertain cultural affiliation until the 5th century. They were invaded by [[Gaels]] from Ireland starting perhaps in the 4th century or earlier, whose language eventually predominated. In the 8th and 9th centuries this area, like others, suffered raids and invasions by Vikings from [[Norway]], and the islands became known to the Gaels as ''Innse-Gall'', the Islands of the Foreigners. Around 875, Norwegian jarls, or princes, came to these islands to avoid losing their independence in the course of King [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]]'s unification of [[Norway]], but Harald pursued them and conquered the [[Hebrides]] as well as [[Isle of Man|Man]], and the [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney Islands]]. The following year, the people of the Isles, both Gael and Norse, rebelled. Harald sent his cousin [[Ketill Flatnose]] to regain control, and Ketil then became [[Rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Isles]]. Scotland and Norway would continue to dispute overlordship of the area, with the jarls of Orkney at times seeing themselves as independent rulers.\n\nIn 973, [[Maccus mac Arailt]], King of the Isles, [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Kenneth III]], King of the Scots, and [[M\u00e1el Coluim I of Strathclyde]] formed a defensive alliance, but subsequently the Scandinavians defeated Gilla Adomn\u00e1in of the Isles and expelled him to Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Norse nobleman [[Godred Crovan]] became ruler of Man and the Isles, but he was deposed in 1095 by the new King of Norway, [[Magnus III of Norway|Magnus Bareleg]]. In 1098, Magnus entered into a treaty with King [[Edgar of Scotland]], intended as a demarcation of their respective areas of authority. Magnus was confirmed in control of the Isles and Edgar of the mainland. Lavery cites a tale from the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', according to which King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] offered Earl Magnus of Orkney all the islands off the west coast navigable with the rudder set. Magnus then allegedly had a skiff hauled across the neck of land at [[Tarbert, Kintyre|Tarbert]], [[Loch Fyne]] with himself at the helm, thus including the Kintyre peninsula in the Isles' sphere of influence. (The date given falls after the end of Malcolm's reign in 1093.)\n\n===Founding of the dynasties===\n[[Somerled]], Gilledomman's grandson, seized the Isles (i.e. everything except the Isle of Man & Skye) from the King of Man in 1156 and founded a dynasty that in time became the ''Lords of the Isles''. He had Celtic blood on his father's side and Norse on his mother's: his contemporaries knew him as ''Somerled Macgilbred'', ''Somhairle'' or in Norse ''Sumarlidi H\u00f6ld'' ('Somerled' means \"summer wanderer\", the name given to the Vikings). He took the title ''[[R\u00ed]] Innse Gall'' (King of the Hebrides) as well as ''[[King of Mann]]''.\n\nAfter Somerled's death in 1164, three of his sons, and his brother-in-law (the King of Man), divided his realm between them:\n* The King of Man : Man, [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Harris, Scotland|Harris]], and [[Skye]]\n* The sons of Somerled :\n** [[Aonghus mac Somhairle|Angus]] : unclear area, perhaps the remaining northern regions\n** [[Dubgall mac Somairle|Dougall]] (ancestor of [[Clan MacDougall]]) : [[Morvern]], [[Ardnamurchan]], and [[Isle of Mull|Mull]]\n** [[Ragnall mac Somairle|Ronald]] : unclear area, perhaps the southern regions\n\nFor reasons which are now unclear, Ronald's sons seem to have taken over the territory of both him and Angus, splitting it between them:\n*[[Domhnall mac Raghnaill|Donald Mor McRanald]], who would give his name to the [[Clan Donald]] (which would contest territory with the MacDougalls) : [[Islay]], [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], [[Kintyre]], [[Knapdale]]\n*[[Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Raghnaill|Rory]] (ancestor of [[Clan Macruari]]) : [[Uist]], [[Garmoran]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]]\n\n==The MacDonald lordship==\n[[File:MacDonald of the Isles (MacIan).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clan Donald|MacDonald]], Lord of the Isles \u2013 a [[R.

These ships had developed from the Viking [[longship]]s and [[knarr]]s, clinker-built with a square sail and rows of oars. From the 14th century they changed from using a steering oar to a stern rudder. These ships took part in sea battles and attacked castles or forts built close to the sea. The Lordship specified the [[feudal]] dues of its subjects in terms of numbers and sizes of the galleys (birlinns) each area had to provide in service to their Lord.\n\n===List of MacDonald Lords of the Isles===\n\n*[[John of Islay, Lord of the Isles|John of Islay I, Lord of the Isles]]\n*[[Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles]]\n*[[Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross|Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles]]\n*[[John of Islay, Earl of Ross|John of Islay II, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles]]\n*[[Aonghas \u00d3g|Angus \u00d3g]]\n\n===Council of the Isles===\n[[File:Islands of Loch Finlaggan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ruins of [[Finlaggan Castle]] on Eilean M\u00f2r, Loch Finlaggan, on the island of [[Islay]], where the Council of the Isles met.]]\nThe Lord was advised (at least on an occasional basis) by a Council.

The treaty between Edward IV and MacDonald II has been used to show how the MacDonald Lords were viewed as independent rulers of their kingdom, freely entering into national and military treaties with foreign governments. Unfortunately for the MacDonald sovereigns, the civil war in England, known as the [[Wars of the Roses]], prevented the completion of the alliance between Edward IV and MacDonald II. Upon the discovery of his alliance with Edward IV in 1493, MacDonald II had his ancestral lands, estates, and titles taken from him by [[James IV of Scotland]]. In addition to James IV seeking revenge on MacDonald II, he possessed a larger military force and was able to impose his will on the West Coast of Scotland, though uprisings and rebellions were common.

It emerged from a series of hybrid [[Viking]]/[[Gaels|Gaelic]] rulers of the west coast and islands of [[Scotland]] in the [[Middle Ages]], who wielded sea-power with fleets of [[galley]]s ([[birlinn]]s). Although they were, at times, nominal [[vassal]]s of the [[Kings of Norway]], [[High King of Ireland|Ireland]], or [[King of Scotland|Scotland]], the island chiefs remained functionally independent for many centuries. Their territory included the [[Hebrides]] ([[Isle of Skye|Skye]] and [[Ross-shire|Ross]] from 1438), [[Knoydart]], [[Ardnamurchan]], and the [[Kintyre]] peninsula. At their height they were the greatest landowners and most powerful lords in Britain after the [[Kings of England]] and Scotland.<ref>At their height the Lords of the Isles were thus of comparable power to the [[Geraldines]] or perhaps even the [[O'Neill dynasty]] of Late Medieval Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe end of the [[Clan Donald|MacDonald Lords]] came in 1493 when [[John MacDonald II|MacDonald II]] had his ancestral homeland, estates, and titles seized by King [[James IV of Scotland]]. Since that time, the MacDonald Clan has contested the right of James IV to the Lordship of the Isles and uprisings and rebellions against the Scottish Monarch were common. More recently, the Lordship of the Isles has been held by the [[Duke of Rothesay]], the eldest son and heir apparent of the King of Scotland, a title which, since the creation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], is borne by the [[Prince of Wales]]. Thus [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] is the current Lord of the Isles. \n\n[[Finlaggan]] on [[Islay]] was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under [[Clan Donald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlaggan.org/|title=Finlaggan, Islay: The Centre of the Lords of the Isles|publisher=Finlaggan Trust|date=2015|accessdate=2018-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Armorials==\nThe arms adopted by the Lord of the Isles varied over time, but the blazon given and illustrated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.appletonstudios.com/2011_02_01_archive.html|title=Heraldry|publisher=}}</ref> in the \"Armorial of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount\" (1542) is: ''Or, an eagle displayed gules beaked and armed sable overall a lymphad sable''.\n\n==Background==\n{{original research section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Image:Diocese of the Isles, circa 1300 (map 2).png|thumb|upright|The Norwegian [[Diocese of the Isles]], which aligns with lands that formed the Norwegian Kingdom of the Isles]]\nThe west coast and islands of present-day Scotland were those of a people or peoples of uncertain cultural affiliation until the 5th century. They were invaded by [[Gaels]] from Ireland starting perhaps in the 4th century or earlier, whose language eventually predominated. In the 8th and 9th centuries this area, like others, suffered raids and invasions by Vikings from [[Norway]], and the islands became known to the Gaels as ''Innse-Gall'', the Islands of the Foreigners. Around 875, Norwegian jarls, or princes, came to these islands to avoid losing their independence in the course of King [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]]'s unification of [[Norway]], but Harald pursued them and conquered the [[Hebrides]] as well as [[Isle of Man|Man]], and the [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney Islands]]. The following year, the people of the Isles, both Gael and Norse, rebelled. Harald sent his cousin [[Ketill Flatnose]] to regain control, and Ketil then became [[Rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Isles]]. Scotland and Norway would continue to dispute overlordship of the area, with the jarls of Orkney at times seeing themselves as independent rulers.\n\nIn 973, [[Maccus mac Arailt]], King of the Isles, [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Kenneth III]], King of the Scots, and [[M\u00e1el Coluim I of Strathclyde]] formed a defensive alliance, but subsequently the Scandinavians defeated Gilla Adomn\u00e1in of the Isles and expelled him to Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Norse nobleman [[Godred Crovan]] became ruler of Man and the Isles, but he was deposed in 1095 by the new King of Norway, [[Magnus III of Norway|Magnus Bareleg]]. In 1098, Magnus entered into a treaty with King [[Edgar of Scotland]], intended as a demarcation of their respective areas of authority. Magnus was confirmed in control of the Isles and Edgar of the mainland. Lavery cites a tale from the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', according to which King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] offered Earl Magnus of Orkney all the islands off the west coast navigable with the rudder set. Magnus then allegedly had a skiff hauled across the neck of land at [[Tarbert, Kintyre|Tarbert]], [[Loch Fyne]] with himself at the helm, thus including the Kintyre peninsula in the Isles' sphere of influence.
