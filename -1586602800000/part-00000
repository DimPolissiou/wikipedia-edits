Apple started developing the platform in 1987<!-- See Apple confidential 2.0 by O. Linzmayer --> and shipped the first devices in 1993. Production officially ended on February 27, 1998. Newton devices ran on a proprietary [[operating system]], [[Newton OS]]; examples include Apple's [[MessagePad]] series and the [[eMate 300]], and other companies also released devices running on Newton OS. Most Newton devices were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor and all featured handwriting-based input.\n\nThe Newton was considered technologically innovative at its debut, but a combination of factors, some of which included its high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature, limited its sales. Apple cancelled the platform at the direction of [[Steve Jobs]], after his return to Apple, in 1998.\n\n[[File:Newton Lewt (2200371795).jpg|thumb|right|Three Newton MessagePad devices with keyboard and LinearFlash [[PCMCIA]] memory card accessories]]\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Apple Newton ASIC.jpg|thumb|right|The custom ASIC chip inside the original Apple Newton H1000]]\n[[File:Apple Newton PCB.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the Apple Newton Messagepad H1000, with back cover removed]]\n[[File:Colour Apple Newton Logo.JPG|thumb|The original color Apple logo on the Newton]]\n\nThe Newton project was a [[personal digital assistant]] platform. The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the phrase \"personal digital assistant\" was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's CEO [[John Sculley]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lowendmac.com/2013/the-story-behind-apples-newton/ |title=The Story Behind Apple's Newton |first=Tom |last=Hormby |date=February 7, 2006 |publisher=Low End Mac}}</ref> the driving force behind the project.

The handwriting software was barely ready by 1993 and its tendency to misread characters was widely derided in the media. This was parodied in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode [[Lisa on Ice]]; where a scene makes fun of the Newton's handwriting recognition turning \"Beat up Martin\" into \"Eat up Martha\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-simpsons-eat-up-martha-was-the-first-autocorrect-fail/|title=The Simpsons' 'Eat Up Martha' was the first autocorrect fail|last=Hide|first=Nick|publisher=CNET|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Garry Trudeau]] also mocked the Newton in a weeklong arc of his comic strip ''[[Doonesbury]]'', portraying it as a costly toy that served the same function as a cheap notepad, and using its accuracy problems to humorous effect. In one panel, [[Michael Doonesbury]]'s Newton misreads the words \"Catching on?\" as \"Egg Freckles\", a phrase that became widely repeated as symbolic of the Newton's problems. This phrase was subsequently included as a trigger for an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in later editions of the MessagePad, producing a panel from the strip when it was entered on the device. In acknowledgement of the strip, Apple subsequently gifted a MessagePad to Trudeau.<ref>{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Doonesbury' and Apple Hatch a Comic Surprise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/18/business/doonesbury-and-apple-hatch-a-comic-surprise.html|accessdate=June 15, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 18, 1995}}</ref> Although the software improved substantially in Newton OS 2.0, it was not enough to inspire strong sales.<ref name=Evans>{{cite book |last1= Evans |first1= David S. |last2= Hagiu |first2= Andrei |last3= Schmalensee |first3= Richard |year= 2008 |title= Invisible Engines: How Software Platforms Drive Innovation and Transform Industries |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5Wx6-uv-DSkC&pg=PA397&dq=Evans,+Hagiu,+and+Schmalensee&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIu_zm_v6XyQIVS5IeCh1q2gh7#v=onepage&q=Newton&f=false |location= |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |pages= 159\u2013161|isbn= 0262262649}}</ref>\n\nThe Newton became popular in some industries, notably the medical field. However, the debut of the competing [[Palm Pilot]] substantially reduced its market share. Apple struggled to find a new direction for the Newton, and when [[Steve Jobs]] returned to the company in 1997, he killed the product line. He was critical of the device's weak performance, the management of the development team, and the stylus, which he disliked as it prevented the use of the fingers. He was likely also motivated by the fact that the Newton was the pet project of his old adversary John Sculley. However, Jobs saw potential in the technology and concept, if not the execution, and eventually led Apple to create its [[multi-touch]] devices inspired by [[FingerWorks]], the [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].<ref name=Evans/><ref>{{cite web|last=Honan|first= Matt|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/08/remembering-the-apple-newtons-prophetic-failure-and-lasting-ideals/|title=Remembering the Apple Newton's Prophetic Failure and Lasting Impact|date=August 5, 2013|work=WIRED|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Product details==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Hardware models===\n'''From Apple''':\n* [[MessagePad]] (also known as the H1000, OMP or Original MessagePad)\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 100]] (same hardware as OMP, but newer system version)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luckie|first1=Douglas|title=Newton MessagePad|url=https://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/mp100.htm|website=Luckie's Homepage|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 110]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 120]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 130]]\n* [[eMate 300]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2000]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2100]]\n\n'''From Motorola''':\n* [[Motorola Marco]]\n\n'''From Sharp''':<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luckie|first1=Douglas|title=Sharp's Newton ExpertPad|url=https://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/epad.htm|website=Luckie's Homepage|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>\n* Sharp ExpertPad PI-7000 (equivalent to OMP)\n* Sharp ExpertPad PI-7100 (equivalent to MP 100)\n\n'''From Digital Ocean''':\n* Tarpon<ref>{{cite news|last1=Quinlan|first1=Tom|title=Newton-based PDA announced|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39|accessdate=18 July 2015|work=InfoWorld|issue=Vol. 17, No. 2|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|date=9 January 1995}}</ref>\n* Seahorse<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ortiz|first1=Kedesh|title=Back before iPhones and Androids, we had these...|url=http://www.hypeorlando.com/tech-under-the-sun/2014/03/11/the-history-of-the-first-smarphones/|website=Tech Under The Sun|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''From Siemens''':\n* Siemens Note Phone<ref>{{cite web|title=Siemens NotePhone|url=https://randoc.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/siemens-notephone/|website=Siemens NotePhone|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>{{Better source|date=September 2015|reason=The provided link is a self-published blog post.}}\n\n'''From Harris''':\n* Harris SuperTech 2000<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schmidt|first1=Tim|title=Discord in hardwareland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47|accessdate=18 July 2015|work=Network World|issue=Vol. 13, No. 8|publisher=IDG Network World Inc|date=19 February 1996}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Apple Newton-IMG 0454-cropped.jpg|MP100\nFile:Newton MessagePad 120 opened.JPG|MP120\nFile:Applenewton emate300.jpg|eMate 300\nFile:Apple Newton.jpg|MP2000\n</gallery>\n\n===Application software===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Controlpanelnewton.png|thumb|right|''The [[Newton OS]] GUI'']] -->\nMost Newton devices were pre-loaded with a variety of software to help in personal data organization and management.  This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc.), time-zone maps, etc.  In later/2.x versions of the [[Newton OS]] these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled [[Third-party developer|3rd party]] applications, such as Notion: The Newton List Manager, the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a \"lite\" version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket [[Quicken]], the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client.  Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and [[Personal information manager|PIM (Personal Information Manager)]] application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled [[Apple Newton Software|Newton Connection Utilities]] (or the older Newton Connection Kit, which had been sold separately for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the OS).\n\n====Notes====\nThe Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed, or that had been recognized from handwriting, as well as free-hand sketches, [[Apple Newton#User interface|\"Shapes\", and \"ink text\"]].\n\n[[Image:Apple newton messagepad checklist jk.jpg|left|thumbnail|Photograph of screen displaying Checklist, some bullet points [[Tick (checkmark)|checked]] and/or \"collapsed\"]] In version 2.0 of the [[Newton OS]], the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed \"stationery\", 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications.\n\nOne of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS 2.0 was a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Bullet point|bullet-ed]], collapsible, multi-line \"[[Checklist]]\", an implementation of [[outliner]] software.  This could be used for organizing thoughts, priorities, [[Time management|\"to do\" lists]], planning steps and sub-tasks, etc.  Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired.  A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical [[outline (summary)|outline]]/[[Tree structure|tree]].  When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub-[[Tree structure|tree]] of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well.  If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would \"roll up\" or collapse all the children ([[WindowShade|\"windowshade\" effect]]).  The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear.  Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear. This functionality arrived in Newton OS 2.0, but several third parties made similar software previously for OS 1.x Newton machines, the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad, released in 1993.\n\n====Names====\nThe Names application was used for storing contacts. Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.<ref>Apple Computer. [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=38006 \"Newton Connection Utilities ReadMe\"], Apple, July 24, 1997</ref><ref>Apple Computer. [http://www.oldschool.net/newton/papers/ncu.html#NCU \"Newton Connection Utilities Features\"], Newton Source</ref>  Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application.  Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches.  Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields.  Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, \"people\", \"companies\", and \"groups\", but a developer could define new types, for instance \"client\", \"patient\", etc. Stand Alone Software, Inc. also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit, which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools.\n\n====Dates====\nDates supplied calendar, events, meeting, and alarms functions, including an integrated [[Time management|\"to do\" list]] manager.  It offered many different display and navigation styles, including a list view, graphical day \"time blocking\" view, or a week, month, or year grid.  As with Names and Notes, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.\n\n===Operating system and programming environment===\nThe [[Newton OS]] consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a [[microkernel]] handles resources like [[Task (computers)|tasks]] and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in [[C++]], including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the [[NewtonScript]] environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript.\n\nNewtonScript is an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] language, developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waltersmith.us/|title=Walter Smith, software guy|work=waltersmith.us|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref>  Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment. Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming.\n\nThe Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton platform, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton platform and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector window for debugging. Initially, it was only available for [[Macintosh]] computers, and later a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic.\n\n===Data storage===\nData in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as [[Soup (Apple Newton)|soups]]. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended\u2014a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book. The soup system also made it easy to synchronize data, and the Newton Connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data. Among many file formats are the [[Rich Text Format]], [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Microsoft Works]], and many more.\n\nAnother consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the \"Storage\" area of the \"Extras\" drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), or with third-party tools such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.\n\nFinally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the [[Newton OS]] introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects.\n\n===Package installation, capacity planning, and disaster recovery===\nSeveral software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms:\n\n* [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]]\n* [[OS X]]\n* [[UNIX]]\n* [[Linux]]\n* [[Microsoft Windows]]\n\n==Newton technology after cancellation==\nBefore the Newton project was canceled, it was \"spun off\" into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] was fired by the board and [[Steve Jobs]] took over as then interim CEO. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]], the company that created the operating system for the original [[iPod]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSpeculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]]. Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the \"Print Recognizer\" part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into [[Mac OS X v10.2]] (known as \"Jaguar\"). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as \"[[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]]\", appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. An [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in Print Recognizer on the Newton (write \"ROSETTA! ROSETTA! ROSETTA!\", and the Newton will insert \"ROSETTA! ROSETTA! Hey, that's me!\" instead) was present in Inkwell in Mac OS 10.2 and 10.3, but seems to have been removed in 10.4. [[Larry Yaeger]] was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton, and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X.<ref>[http://wwnc.newtontalk.net/2004/program/larryyaeger/slides-larryyaeger.pdf Handwriting Recognition Technology in the Newton's Second Generation \"Print Recognizer\" (The One That Worked)], By [[Larry Yaeger]]{{Snd}} Apple Computer, World Wide Newton Conference, September 4\u20135, 2004, Slides</ref> The [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] name was later used for Apple's [[PowerPC]] software translation layer for [[Intel]]-based Macs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSome of the handwriting recognition technology from the Newton later found its way into [[Windows CE]].

It is currently available for the Sharp [[Zaurus]], Apple's [[Mac OS X]], [[Nokia]] [[Maemo]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and the [[Pepper Pad]] 3. The emulator is an open source project, but requires an original Newton ROM to be installed in order to function. [[iPhone]]s and [[iPads]] run Einstein since September 2010.

Apple started developing the platform in 1987<!-- See Apple confidential 2.0 by O. Linzmayer --> and shipped the first devices in 1993. Production officially ended on February 27, 1998. Newton devices ran on a proprietary [[operating system]], [[Newton OS]]; examples include Apple's [[MessagePad]] series and the [[eMate 300]], and other companies also released devices running on Newton OS. Most Newton devices were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor and all featured handwriting-based input.\n\nThe Newton was considered technologically innovative at its debut, but a combination of factors, some of which included its high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature, limited its sales. Apple cancelled the platform at the direction of [[Steve Jobs]], after his return to Apple, in 1998.\n\n[[File:Newton Lewt (2200371795).jpg|thumb|right|Three Newton MessagePad devices with keyboard and LinearFlash [[PCMCIA]] memory card accessories]]\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Apple Newton ASIC.jpg|thumb|right|The custom ASIC chip inside the original Apple Newton H1000]]\n[[File:Apple Newton PCB.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the Apple Newton Messagepad H1000, with back cover removed]]\n[[File:Colour Apple Newton Logo.JPG|thumb|The original color Apple logo on the Newton]]\n\nThe Newton project was a [[personal digital assistant]] platform.

This was parodied in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode [[Lisa on Ice]]; where a scene makes fun of the Newton's handwriting recognition turning \"Beat up Martin\" into \"Eat up Martha\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-simpsons-eat-up-martha-was-the-first-autocorrect-fail/|title=The Simpsons' 'Eat Up Martha' was the first autocorrect fail|last=Hide|first=Nick|publisher=CNET|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Garry Trudeau]] also mocked the Newton in a weeklong arc of his comic strip ''[[Doonesbury]]'', portraying it as a costly toy that served the same function as a cheap notepad, and using its accuracy problems to humorous effect. In one panel, [[Michael Doonesbury]]'s Newton misreads the words \"Catching on?\" as \"Egg Freckles\", a phrase that became widely repeated as symbolic of the Newton's problems. This phrase was subsequently included as a trigger for an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in later editions of the MessagePad, producing a panel from the strip when it was entered on the device. In acknowledgement of the strip, Apple subsequently gifted a MessagePad to Trudeau.<ref>{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Doonesbury' and Apple Hatch a Comic Surprise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/18/business/doonesbury-and-apple-hatch-a-comic-surprise.html|accessdate=June 15, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 18, 1995}}</ref> Although the software improved substantially in Newton OS 2.0, it was not enough to inspire strong sales.<ref name=Evans>{{cite book |last1= Evans |first1= David S. |last2= Hagiu |first2= Andrei |last3= Schmalensee |first3= Richard |year= 2008 |title= Invisible Engines: How Software Platforms Drive Innovation and Transform Industries |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5Wx6-uv-DSkC&pg=PA397&dq=Evans,+Hagiu,+and+Schmalensee&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIu_zm_v6XyQIVS5IeCh1q2gh7#v=onepage&q=Newton&f=false |location= |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |pages= 159\u2013161|isbn= 0262262649}}</ref>\n\nThe Newton became popular in some industries, notably the medical field. However, the debut of the competing [[Palm Pilot]] substantially reduced its market share. Apple struggled to find a new direction for the Newton, and when [[Steve Jobs]] returned to the company in 1997, he killed the product line. He was critical of the device's weak performance, the management of the development team, and the stylus, which he disliked as it prevented the use of the fingers. He was likely also motivated by the fact that the Newton was the pet project of his old adversary John Sculley. However, Jobs saw potential in the technology and concept, if not the execution, and eventually led Apple to create its [[multi-touch]] devices inspired by [[FingerWorks]], the [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].<ref name=Evans/><ref>{{cite web|last=Honan|first= Matt|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/08/remembering-the-apple-newtons-prophetic-failure-and-lasting-ideals/|title=Remembering the Apple Newton's Prophetic Failure and Lasting Impact|date=August 5, 2013|work=WIRED|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Product details==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Hardware models===\n'''From Apple''':\n* [[MessagePad]] (also known as the H1000, OMP or Original MessagePad)\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 100]] (same hardware as OMP, but newer system version)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luckie|first1=Douglas|title=Newton MessagePad|url=https://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/mp100.htm|website=Luckie's Homepage|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 110]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 120]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 130]]\n* [[eMate 300]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2000]]\n* [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2100]]\n\n'''From Motorola''':\n* [[Motorola Marco]]\n\n'''From Sharp''':<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luckie|first1=Douglas|title=Sharp's Newton ExpertPad|url=https://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/epad.htm|website=Luckie's Homepage|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>\n* Sharp ExpertPad PI-7000 (equivalent to OMP)\n* Sharp ExpertPad PI-7100 (equivalent to MP 100)\n\n'''From Digital Ocean''':\n* Tarpon<ref>{{cite news|last1=Quinlan|first1=Tom|title=Newton-based PDA announced|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39|accessdate=18 July 2015|work=InfoWorld|issue=Vol. 17, No. 2|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|date=9 January 1995}}</ref>\n* Seahorse<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ortiz|first1=Kedesh|title=Back before iPhones and Androids, we had these...|url=http://www.hypeorlando.com/tech-under-the-sun/2014/03/11/the-history-of-the-first-smarphones/|website=Tech Under The Sun|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''From Siemens''':\n* Siemens Note Phone<ref>{{cite web|author=Genghis7777|title=Siemens NotePhone|url=https://randoc.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/siemens-notephone/|website=Siemens NotePhone|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>{{Better source|date=September 2015|reason=The provided link is a self-published blog post.}}\n\n'''From Harris''':\n* Harris SuperTech 2000<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schmidt|first1=Tim|title=Discord in hardwareland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47|accessdate=18 July 2015|work=Network World|issue=Vol. 13, No. 8|publisher=IDG Network World Inc|date=19 February 1996}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Apple Newton-IMG 0454-cropped.jpg|MP100\nFile:Newton MessagePad 120 opened.JPG|MP120\nFile:Applenewton emate300.jpg|eMate 300\nFile:Apple Newton.jpg|MP2000\n</gallery>\n\n===Application software===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Controlpanelnewton.png|thumb|right|''The [[Newton OS]] GUI'']] -->\nMost Newton devices were pre-loaded with a variety of software to help in personal data organization and management.  This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc.), time-zone maps, etc.  In later/2.x versions of the [[Newton OS]] these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled [[Third-party developer|3rd party]] applications, such as Notion: The Newton List Manager, the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a \"lite\" version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket [[Quicken]], the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client.  Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and [[Personal information manager|PIM (Personal Information Manager)]] application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled [[Apple Newton Software|Newton Connection Utilities]] (or the older Newton Connection Kit, which had been sold separately for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the OS).\n\n====Notes====\nThe Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed, or that had been recognized from handwriting, as well as free-hand sketches, [[Apple Newton#User interface|\"Shapes\", and \"ink text\"]].\n\n[[Image:Apple newton messagepad checklist jk.jpg|left|thumbnail|Photograph of screen displaying Checklist, some bullet points [[Tick (checkmark)|checked]] and/or \"collapsed\"]] In version 2.0 of the [[Newton OS]], the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed \"stationery\", 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications.\n\nOne of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS 2.0 was a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Bullet point|bullet-ed]], collapsible, multi-line \"[[Checklist]]\", an implementation of [[outliner]] software.  This could be used for organizing thoughts, priorities, [[Time management|\"to do\" lists]], planning steps and sub-tasks, etc.  Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired.  A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical [[outline (summary)|outline]]/[[Tree structure|tree]].  When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub-[[Tree structure|tree]] of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well.  If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would \"roll up\" or collapse all the children ([[WindowShade|\"windowshade\" effect]]).  The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear.  Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear. This functionality arrived in Newton OS 2.0, but several third parties made similar software previously for OS 1.x Newton machines, the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad, released in 1993.\n\n====Names====\nThe Names application was used for storing contacts. Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.<ref>Apple Computer. [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=38006 \"Newton Connection Utilities ReadMe\"], Apple, July 24, 1997</ref><ref>Apple Computer. [http://www.oldschool.net/newton/papers/ncu.html#NCU \"Newton Connection Utilities Features\"], Newton Source</ref>  Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application.  Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches.  Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields.  Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, \"people\", \"companies\", and \"groups\", but a developer could define new types, for instance \"client\", \"patient\", etc. Stand Alone Software, Inc. also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit, which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools.\n\n====Dates====\nDates supplied calendar, events, meeting, and alarms functions, including an integrated [[Time management|\"to do\" list]] manager.  It offered many different display and navigation styles, including a list view, graphical day \"time blocking\" view, or a week, month, or year grid.  As with Names and Notes, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.\n\n===Operating system and programming environment===\nThe [[Newton OS]] consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a [[microkernel]] handles resources like [[Task (computers)|tasks]] and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in [[C++]], including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the [[NewtonScript]] environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript.\n\nNewtonScript is an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] language, developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waltersmith.us/|title=Walter Smith, software guy|work=waltersmith.us|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref>  Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment. Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming.\n\nThe Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton platform, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton platform and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector window for debugging. Initially, it was only available for [[Macintosh]] computers, and later a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic.\n\n===Data storage===\nData in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as [[Soup (Apple Newton)|soups]]. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended\u2014a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book. The soup system also made it easy to synchronize data, and the Newton Connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data. Among many file formats are the [[Rich Text Format]], [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Microsoft Works]], and many more.\n\nAnother consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the \"Storage\" area of the \"Extras\" drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), or with third-party tools such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.\n\nFinally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the [[Newton OS]] introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects.\n\n===Package installation, capacity planning, and disaster recovery===\nSeveral software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms:\n\n* [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]]\n* [[OS X]]\n* [[UNIX]]\n* [[Linux]]\n* [[Microsoft Windows]]\n\n==Newton technology after cancellation==\nBefore the Newton project was canceled, it was \"spun off\" into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] was fired by the board and [[Steve Jobs]] took over as then interim CEO. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]], the company that created the operating system for the original [[iPod]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSpeculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]]. Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the \"Print Recognizer\" part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into [[Mac OS X v10.2]] (known as \"Jaguar\"). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as \"[[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]]\", appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. An [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in Print Recognizer on the Newton (write \"ROSETTA! ROSETTA! ROSETTA!\", and the Newton will insert \"ROSETTA! ROSETTA! Hey, that's me!\" instead) was present in Inkwell in Mac OS 10.2 and 10.3, but seems to have been removed in 10.4. [[Larry Yaeger]] was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton, and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X.<ref>[http://wwnc.newtontalk.net/2004/program/larryyaeger/slides-larryyaeger.pdf Handwriting Recognition Technology in the Newton's Second Generation \"Print Recognizer\" (The One That Worked)], By [[Larry Yaeger]]{{Snd}} Apple Computer, World Wide Newton Conference, September 4\u20135, 2004, Slides</ref> The [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] name was later used for Apple's [[PowerPC]] software translation layer for [[Intel]]-based Macs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSome of the handwriting recognition technology from the Newton later found its way into [[Windows CE]].  The letter preferences menus showing the different ways that people write cursive characters were pixel identical on Windows CE to those previously used on the MessagePad.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\nAt an ''[[All Things Digital]]'' conference in 2004, Steve Jobs made reference to a new \"Apple PDA\" (perhaps a successor to the Newton) which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market.<ref>[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/04/06/07/jobs_apple_developed_but_did_not_ship_apple_pda.html Jobs: Apple developed, but did not ship Apple PDA], By Kasper Jade, June 7, 2004, AppleInsider</ref>  The tablet likely eventually evolved into the iPhone or iPad.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\n===Newton emulation===\nSince 2004, the Einstein Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/einstein/|title=pguyot/Einstein|work=GitHub|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> has been working on emulating the Newton for use as an alternative OS on other platforms. It is currently available for the Sharp [[Zaurus]], Apple's [[Mac OS X]], [[Nokia]] [[Maemo]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and the [[Pepper Pad]] 3. The emulator is an open source project, but requires an original Newton ROM to be installed in order to function. [[iPhone]]s and [[iPads]] run Einstein since September 2010.

It was at this time that he met and became close to [[Soga Ry\u014djin|Soga Ryojin]]. After graduating, he returned home and worked to propagate the ideas of Kiyozawa. In 1916, Kaneko took up a position on the faculty of [[\u014ctani University]]. In 1925 and 1926, he published three works that took a controversial position on the nature of the Pure Land, and the authorities within the [[Higashi Hongan-ji]] judged his views to be heretical. In 1928, he resigned his professorship under pressure, and was suspended from the priesthood. He had to leave Kyoto and take up a position teaching at Hiroshima Bunkyo University. During this time, he continued to write, to publish, and to give Dharma talks all around the country. In 1941, the Jodo Shinshu leadership reinstated his priestly faculties and had him return to \u014ctani University.\n\nKaneko authored many essays and books on Shin Buddhist thought as well as the history of Buddhism.  These have come to be held in very high regard, helping to sculpt modern day Jodo Shinshu philosophy. He was a good friend of [[Soga Ryojin]] (1875 &ndash; 1971), another student of Manshi who likewise taught at Otani University.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Andreasen, Esben.

It was at this time that he met and became close to [[Soga Ry\u014djin|Soga Ryojin]]. After graduating, he returned home and worked to propagate the ideas of Kiyozawa. In 1916, Kaneko took up a position on the faculty of [[\u014ctani University]]. In 1925 and 1926, he published three works that took a controversial position on the nature of the Pure Land, and the authorities within the [[Higashi Hongan-ji]] judged his views to be heretical. In 1928, he resigned his professorship under pressure, and was suspended from the priesthood. He had to leave Kyoto and take up a position teaching at Hiroshima Bunkyo University. During this time, he continued to write, to publish, and to give Dharma talks all around the country. In 1941, the Jodo Shinshu leadership reinstated his priestly faculties and had him return to \u014ctani University.\n\nKaneko authored many essays and books on Shin Buddhist thought as well as the history of Buddhism.  These have come to be held in very high regard, helping to sculpt modern day Jodo Shinshu philosophy. He was a good friend of [[Soga Ryojin]] (1875 &ndash; 1971), another student of Manshi who likewise taught at Otani University.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Andreasen, Esben.

The program was the brainchild of [[Yamamoto Gombei]], who would later become the Minister of the Navy and the eighth Prime Minister of Japan. The completion of the plan led to the emergence of Japan as a first-class naval power.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=57}} Whereas during [[First Sino-Japanese War|the war with China]], the Japanese had gone into the conflict with a makeshift force of warships, they would now have a true battle fleet.\n\n==Origins==\nAfter the First Sino-Japanese war there was a tide of popular enthusiasm for naval glory that was created by Japan's recent triumphs at sea.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=57}} Domestically, the war and the favorable settlement were also tremendous political successes for both the government and the armed services.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=83}} However, with the Triple Intervention on 23 April, the governments of France, Germany and Russia pressured Japan to renounce its claim to the Liaotung Peninsula. The Japanese were well aware of the naval power the three countries possessed in East Asian waters, particularly Russia.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=84}} Without the diplomatic, political or military support of either Britain or the United States and consequently facing little choice the Japanese retroceded the territory back to China for an additional 30 million taels (roughly \u00a545 million). Although the victory against China had elevated Japan's status, it also further entangled the country in the imperial rivalries in East Asia and the Pacific.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=84}} The Triple Intervention had also underscored the extent of Japan's maritime weakness in relation to the West.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=57}} However this maritime weakness, combined with the political and popular capital gained as a result of the war with China, also subsequently encouraged popular and legislative support for naval expansion in the aftermath of the war.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=84}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background:lightgrey; color:black\" | '''Japanese Naval Construction Program'''<br><small>(1896\u20131905)</small>{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=87}}\n|-\n|align=center rowspan=1|'''Warship type'''\n| colspan=\"1\" align=center |'''Number'''\n|-\n|First-class steel battleships\n|4\n|-\n|First-class cruisers\n|6\n|-\n|Third-class cruisers\n|3\n|-\n|Torpedo gunboats\n|1\n|-\n|Torpedo depot vessels\n|1\n|-\n|Destroyers\n|23\n|-\n|First-class torpedo boats\n|16\n|-\n|Second-class torpedo boats\n|37\n|-\n|Third-class torpedo boats\n|10\n|-\n| \n| rowspan=\"1\" align=center |'''Total Ships'''\n|-\n|Capital Ships\n|16\n|-\n|Destroyers and torpedo boats\n|88\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=center |'''Total Cost'''\n|\u00a5 213,100,964\n|-\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n==Plans==\nIn May 1895, the Minister of the Navy [[Saig\u014d Tsugumichi]] asked [[Yamamoto Gombei]] to compose a study of Japan's future naval needs.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=84}} Yamamoto, who had been newly appointed to his position as Chief of the Naval Affairs Bureau, sensed that a great opportunity existed to secure significant fleet expansion. Approaching his task with unrelenting enthusiasm, Yamamoto devised a revolutionary plan that would fundamentally transform the navy into a world-class military fleet.\n\nWhile Russia was perceived to Japan's most likely enemy in any future conflict, Yamamoto chose to consider other scenarios rather than simply preparations for a war with Russia. Yamamoto believed that Japan should have sufficient naval strength to not only to deal with a single hypothetical enemy separately, but to also confront any naval force from two combined powers that might be dispatched against Japan from overseas waters; this included Britain and to a lesser extent France in his calculations.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=58}} Yamamoto assumed that with their conflicting global interests, it was highly unlikely that Britain and Russia would ever join together in a war against Japan.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=58}} He considered that it was more likely that Russia or possibly Britain in alliance with a lesser naval power like France or Germany, would dispatch a portion of their fleet against Japan. Yamamoto therefore calculated that four battleships would be the main battle force that either Britain or Russia could divert from their other naval commitments to use against Japan and he also added two more battleships that might be contributed to such a naval expedition by a lesser hostile power. Yamamoto came up with six as the number of battleships that Japan would need have to have in order to achieve victory.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=58}} The depth of the Suez Canal was at that time only {{convert|27|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and the largest warships then being built, which were Britain's 15,000-ton {{sclass-|Majestic|battleship|4}}, had a mean draft of equal depth and therefore could not transit the canal. Such a fleet of warships would have to pass around the Cape of Good Hope, not only would this route take time but every European navy with the exception of the [[Royal Navy]], would have to encounter considerable problems in coaling along the way. Furthermore, establishing repair and docking facilities along the route and in East Asian waters for the largest warships would be an enormous expense for any nation.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=58}}\n\nThus, for its minimum naval security Japan should have a force of six of the largest battleships supplemented by four armored cruisers of at least 7,000 tons.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=59}} The centerpiece of this expansion was to be the acquisition of four new battleships in addition to the two which were already being built in Britain being part of an earlier construction program: the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Fuji||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}}. Yamamoto was not simply recommending the building of a battleship force, he was also advocating the construction of a balanced fleet.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=59}} Just as in the army the infantry was supported by the artillery, cavalry, and engineers, so battleships should be supplemented by lesser warships of various types. Specifically, this meant the inclusion of cruisers that could seek out and pursue the enemy along with a sufficient number of destroyers and torpedo boats capable of striking the enemy in his home ports. The program also included the construction of twenty-three destroyers, sixty-three torpedo boats, and an expansion of Japanese shipyards and repair and training facilities.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=58}}\n\nGiven the changes in naval technology at the time as well as the rapidly shifting balance of naval strength among the maritime powers, no sooner had the 1896 naval expansion plan been authorized than it had to be amended. The program had originally called for the construction of four armored cruisers.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}} Further consideration of Russian building plans led the Japanese to conclude that the six battleships authorized under the 1896 plan might not be sufficient after all, if the Russian navy should decide to concentrate in East Asian waters. Yet budgetary limitations simply did not permit the construction of another battleship squadron. However, as the new [[Harvey armor|Harvey]] and [[Krupp armour#Krupp cemented armour|KC armor]] plates could resist all but the largest [[Armor-piercing shell|AP shells]], Japan could now acquire armored cruisers that could take the place in the battle line. Hence, with new armor and lighter but more powerful quick-firing guns, this new cruiser type was superior to many older battleships still afloat.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}} Subsequently, in the 1897 revisions to the ten-year plan led to the four protected cruisers being substituted for two additional armored cruisers. And as a consequence ''\"Six-Six Fleet\"'' was born: six battleships and six armored cruisers.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}}\n\n==Implementation==\n[[File:Japanese battleship Mikasa.jpg|thumb|right|''Mikasa'' was one of the six battleships ordered as part of the program.]]\nThe Six-six fleet was approved by the cabinet in late 1895 and funded by the Diet in early 1896.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}} The proposed program for a 260,000-ton navy was to be completed over a ten-year period with the total cost being \u00a5280 million, of this total warship acquisitions accounted for just over \u00a5200 million,{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=87}} in two stages of construction. The first stage would begin in 1896 and be completed by 1902; the second would run from 1897 to 1905. The program was financed significantly from the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|Chinese indemnity]] secured after the First Sino-Japanese war.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=88}} This was used to fund the bulk of the naval expansion, roughly \u00a5139 million, with public loans and existing government revenue providing the rest of the financing required over the ten years of the program.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=88}} Critically, this meant that there would no increase in the land tax needed to support naval increases, at least in 1895-96, which was crucial in securing widespread parliamentary support.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=88}} The government did, however, propose a tax increase on sake and tobacco to pay for additional operating expenses that would accompany fleet expansion. Japan's industrial resources at the time were inadequate for the construction of a main battle force of armored warships domestically, as the country was still in the process of developing and acquiring the industrial infrastructure for the construction of major naval vessels. As a result, 90 percent of the 234,000 tons of naval construction contracted for under the ten-year beginning 1896-97 was to be foreign built, and when complete would comprise 70 percent of the Japanese fleet.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}} Of this, the overwhelming majority was built in British shipyards.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}} With the completion of the fleet, Japan would become the fourth strongest naval power in the world in a single decade.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=60}}\n\n==See also==\n[[Eight-eight fleet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=David C|last2=Peattie|first2=Mark R.|authorlink2=Mark Peattie|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887\u20131941 |publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1997|isbn=0-87021-192-7|ref=harv|last-author-amp=y}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lengerer |first1=Hans |title=Warship 2019 |date=2019 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-1-4728-3595-6 |pages=247\u201357 |editor1-last=Jordan |editor1-first=John |chapter=The Genesis of the Six-Six Fleet|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Schencking|first=J.

In ''Official Records'' it states that he was in 5th Regiment Kentucky Mounted Infantry. This enlistment is also mentioned in ''Kentucky Adjutant General's Report \u2013 Confederate Volunteers 1861\u20131865, Vol.1'' page 254 entry 80, where Kiney's enlistment is dated on November 1st 1861. Wikipedia's entry on this unit states that they were disbanded in October 1862 and the troops were given a three way choice, discharge, reenlistment or joining the Kentucky Cavalry. Kiney went with the last option as he enlisted in Company l of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry on 18th November 1863. (This extract is from the book ''The 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' by John B. Wells & Jim Pritchard. See ''Roster of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' www.potterflats.com10thKyhtml) Professor Hoare's segment on Kiney in ''The South's Last Boys in Gray'' reproduces an excerpt of Lloyd B. Walton's article \"He's a Man Even at 109\" from ''The Indianapolis Times'' September 14th 1952. Here Kiney speaks of his Civil War experience, recalling that he was in most of the war and that Shiloh was his toughest fight.

Sheets of that same company kept a diary where Thomas Riddle is mentioned on February 26th 1863.\n        Against this evidence is the fact that Lowry cautions against believing Riddle and that some of Riddle's descendants warn that due to census information, he could not have served in the Civil War.

Unlike the U.S. military archives, the Confederate records had no official archive system after the war. However, for most of the cases investigated, the ages of the claimants alone were enough to prove their claim was false. Walter Williams was generally acknowledged as the \"last Confederate veteran\" in 1950s newspapers. However, in September 1959 an expos\u00e9 by ''The New York Times'' revealed that he was in fact born in 1854 in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and not 1842 as claimed. Still, since [[John B. Salling]] and all the other claimants were dead, Williams was celebrated as the last Confederate veteran after his death on 20 December 1959.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1959|title=Reputed Last Civil War Veteran Dies in Texas After Long Illness: Walter Williams Put His Age at 117 \u2013 Tributes Note the End of an Era|accessdate=17 October 2011|url=http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328015838/http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-date=28 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSalling's own status is disputed. In 1991, William Marvel examined the claims of Salling and several other \"last Civil War veterans\" for a piece in the Civil War history magazine ''Blue & Gray.'' Marvel found census data that indicated Salling was born in 1858, not 1846. Although in 1900 Salling supplied a birthdate of March 1858, he appears to have been born around 1856, still too late to have served in the Confederate Army. The 1860 census lists him as 4 years old, and the 1870 census as 14.<ref name=\"impostors\">{{cite book|title=The great imposters|first=William|last=Marvel|publisher=Blue and Gray|volume=VIII|issue=3|year=1991|pages=32\u201333|location=Columbus}}</ref> William Lundy is listed as 1 year old on the 1860 census, and from 1870 until 1930 he gave census marshals ages that reflected birthdates as early as 1853 and as late as 1860. He did not push his birthdate back to the 1840s until he applied for a Confederate pension from the state of Florida. In the same piece, Marvel confirmed Woolson's claim to be the last surviving Union veteran and asserted that Woolson was the last genuine Civil War veteran on either side. However, Marvel did not present research establishing who, among the several other Confederate claims from the 1950s, some of which appear to be genuine, was the real last Confederate veteran.\n\n=== [[French invasion of Mexico]] (1861\u201367) ===\n* Jules Pujos (1846\u20131942)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fMjAQAAMAAJ&dq=ancien+%22Pujos%22+%22mexique%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Jules+Pujos|title=l\u00e9gion d'honneur|publisher=Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise|date=12 January 1937|page=508|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DDD\" />\n* Francisco Arellano Zenteno (1842\u20131935)&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico.

In ''Official Records'' it states that he was in 5th Regiment Kentucky Mounted Infantry. This enlistment is also mentioned in ''Kentucky Adjutant General's Report \u2013 Confederate Volunteers 1861\u20131865, Vol.1'' page 254 entry 80, where Kiney's enlistment is dated on November 1st 1861. Wikipedia's entry on this unit states that they were disbanded in October 1862 and the troops were given a three way choice, discharge, reenlistment or joining the Kentucky Cavalry. Kiney went with the last option as he enlisted in Company l of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry on 18th November 1863. (This extract is from the book ''The 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' by John B. Wells & Jim Pritchard. See ''Roster of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' www.potterflats.com10thKyhtml) Professor Hoare's segment on Kiney in ''The South's Last Boys in Gray'' reproduces an excerpt of Lloyd B. Walton's article \"He's a Man Even at 109\" from ''The Indianapolis Times'' September 14th 1952. Here Kiney speaks of his Civil War experience, recalling that he was in most of the war and that Shiloh was his toughest fight.

Sheets of that same company kept a diary where Thomas Riddle is mentioned on February 26th 1863.\n        Against this evidence is the fact that Lowry cautions against believing Riddle and that some of Riddle's descendants warn that due to census information, he could not have served in the Civil War.

Unlike the U.S. military archives, the Confederate records had no official archive system after the war. However, for most of the cases investigated, the ages of the claimants alone were enough to prove their claim was false. Walter Williams was generally acknowledged as the \"last Confederate veteran\" in 1950s newspapers. However, in September 1959 an expos\u00e9 by ''The New York Times'' revealed that he was in fact born in 1854 in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and not 1842 as claimed. Still, since [[John B. Salling]] and all the other claimants were dead, Williams was celebrated as the last Confederate veteran after his death on 20 December 1959.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1959|title=Reputed Last Civil War Veteran Dies in Texas After Long Illness: Walter Williams Put His Age at 117 \u2013 Tributes Note the End of an Era|accessdate=17 October 2011|url=http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328015838/http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-date=28 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSalling's own status is disputed. In 1991, William Marvel examined the claims of Salling and several other \"last Civil War veterans\" for a piece in the Civil War history magazine ''Blue & Gray.'' Marvel found census data that indicated Salling was born in 1858, not 1846. Although in 1900 Salling supplied a birthdate of March 1858, he appears to have been born around 1856, still too late to have served in the Confederate Army. The 1860 census lists him as 4 years old, and the 1870 census as 14.<ref name=\"impostors\">{{cite book|title=The great imposters|first=William|last=Marvel|publisher=Blue and Gray|volume=VIII|issue=3|year=1991|pages=32\u201333|location=Columbus}}</ref> William Lundy is listed as 1 year old on the 1860 census, and from 1870 until 1930 he gave census marshals ages that reflected birthdates as early as 1853 and as late as 1860. He did not push his birthdate back to the 1840s until he applied for a Confederate pension from the state of Florida. In the same piece, Marvel confirmed Woolson's claim to be the last surviving Union veteran and asserted that Woolson was the last genuine Civil War veteran on either side. However, Marvel did not present research establishing who, among the several other Confederate claims from the 1950s, some of which appear to be genuine, was the real last Confederate veteran.\n\n=== [[French invasion of Mexico]] (1861\u201367) ===\n* Jules Pujos (1846\u20131942)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fMjAQAAMAAJ&dq=ancien+%22Pujos%22+%22mexique%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Jules+Pujos|title=l\u00e9gion d'honneur|publisher=Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise|date=12 January 1937|page=508|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DDD\" />\n* Francisco Arellano Zenteno (1842\u20131935)&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico.

The date was informally viewed a male counterpart of Women's Day (8 March) in some territories of the Union, however due to the day's limited focus to historical events some countries of the former union have moved to adopt the more 'male specific' 19 November as International Men's Day, including Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Russia and Georgia.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nIn 1968 the American journalist John P. Harris wrote an editorial in the Salina Journal highlighting a lack of balance in the Soviet system, which promoted an International Women's Day for the female workers without promoting a corresponding day for male workers. Harris stated that although he did not begrudge Soviet women their March day of glory, its resulting gender inequality clearly exhibited a serious flaw in the Communist system, which, \"makes much of the equal rights it has given the sexes, but as it turns out, the women are much more equal than the men.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">John P. Harris, 'Red Women \u2013 Painted Town', Salina Journal, p.4. 28 March 1964</ref> Harris stated that while the men toiled along in their grooves doing what their government and womenfolk tell them to do, there was no day when males are recognised for their service, leading Harris to conclude that \"This strikes me as unwarranted discrimination and rank injustice.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> Similar questions about the inequality of observing women's day without a corresponding men's day occurred in media publications from the 1960s through to the 1990s,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&dat=19790308&printsec=frontpage&hl=en Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 'Work, Work, Work', 8 March 1979]</ref><ref name=\"imd11\">[http://internationalmensday.co/pre-1990-documents/ The Age, 'Missing Persons', 7 March 1983] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417041155/http://internationalmensday.co/pre-1990-documents/ |date=17 April 2017}}</ref> at which time the first attempts at inaugurating international Men's Day are recorded.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, J.

The event was conceived and coordinated by Dr. Jerome Teelucksingh from The University of the West Indies at the Families in Action headquarters in Newtown, [[Port of Spain]]. As his rationale for creating the event Dr. Teelucksingh stated, \"I realized there was no day for men... some have said that there is [[Father's Day]], but what about young boys, teenagers and men who are not fathers?\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Dr. Teelucksingh, understanding the importance of celebrating good male role models, felt that his own father had been an example of an excellent role model and so chose 19 November partly because this was his father's birthday, and also because it was the date on which a local sporting team in his country created a level of unity with transcended gender, religious and ethnic divisions.<ref>Dr. Teelucksingh, J.

The commemorations were held at Chibuku Stadium in Chitungwiza under the theme Giving The Boy Child The Best Possible Start In Life. Fred Misi, the chairman of Men's Forum Varume Svinurai/Vhukhani said the commemorations came at a time when attention was being given to the girl child at the expense of boys, and noted, \"Whilst it is important to focus on the specific needs of the girl child, we are creating a crisis by ignoring the specific needs of the boy child.\" Misi highlighted the growing trend that many boys were dropping out of school and were hooked on hard drugs as well as abusing alcohol, while a significant number of those who were completed secondary and tertiary education were roaming the streets because of unemployment. He added the government and Zimbabweans needed to act immediately. A number of prominent persons attended and gave papers on the need to give the boy child assistance. There was drama and poetry from various groups and individual high school students in line with the theme of the celebrations, and the Zimbabwe Minister of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development, Olivia Muchena gave a key note address in which she said, \"It is an occasion for men to celebrate their achievements and contributions, in particular their contributions to community, family, marriage and child care while highlighting the discrimination against them...

One of the International Men's Day themes promoted was to help foster youth to unlock their creative identities to allow them to share their gifts with peers, family and the community, and to be seen and heard for who they are and not how they are perceived. The primary event was a gala dinner titled \"One moment for Change\" to highlight men's potential and the increasing capabilities of men as innovators of society. The dinner was held to raise funds to cover six months music tuition fees for a group of 20 children from the SOS Children's Village whom IMD ambassadors have adopted as part of a mentoring programme for children. Standard Chartered Bank sponsored the dinner, which included a range of iconic speakers who shared their experience and insights with the audience. Standard Chartered Bank Acting CEO Mr Michael Wiegand opened the event by sharing best practices that Standard Chartered Bank uses to address legitimate issues faced by male employees, including the fact that Standard Chartered Bank is the first company in Botswana to offer paternity leave which, he stated, made their male employees feel valued and that they were working for a 21st-century organization. Mr Tebogo Sebego, senior partner at Sebego & Sharma Attorneys and former chairperson of the Law Society of Botswana gave a keynote speech where he emphasized how the child protection laws should be improved, how the society play a role in creating a safe environment for the future generation of men. Mrs Tjipo Mothobi, Director, GBC Health South Africa gave an address on business collective effort. The District Commissioner in his closing remarks made an announcement that by end of December he was convening a meeting with men in the City where they will engage in dialogue on how they can collectively address the issues and challenges men and boys face.

The date was informally viewed a male counterpart of Women's Day (8 March) in some territories of the Union, however due to the day's limited focus to historical events some countries of the former union have moved to adopt the more 'male specific' 19 November as International Men's Day, including Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Russia and Georgia.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nIn 1968 the American journalist John P. Harris wrote an editorial in the Salina Journal highlighting a lack of balance in the Soviet system, which promoted an International Women's Day for the female workers without promoting a corresponding day for male workers. Harris stated that although he did not begrudge Soviet women their March day of glory, its resulting gender inequality clearly exhibited a serious flaw in the Communist system, which, \"makes much of the equal rights it has given the sexes, but as it turns out, the women are much more equal than the men.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">John P. Harris, 'Red Women \u2013 Painted Town', Salina Journal, p.4. 28 March 1964</ref> Harris stated that while the men toiled along in their grooves doing what their government and womenfolk tell them to do, there was no day when males are recognised for their service, leading Harris to conclude that \"This strikes me as unwarranted discrimination and rank injustice.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> Similar questions about the inequality of observing women's day without a corresponding men's day occurred in media publications from the 1960s through to the 1990s,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&dat=19790308&printsec=frontpage&hl=en Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 'Work, Work, Work', 8 March 1979]</ref><ref name=\"imd11\">[http://internationalmensday.co/pre-1990-documents/ The Age, 'Missing Persons', 7 March 1983] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417041155/http://internationalmensday.co/pre-1990-documents/ |date=17 April 2017}}</ref> at which time the first attempts at inaugurating international Men's Day are recorded.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, J.

The event was conceived and coordinated by Dr. Jerome Teelucksingh from The University of the West Indies at the Families in Action headquarters in Newtown, [[Port of Spain]]. As his rationale for creating the event Dr. Teelucksingh stated, \"I realized there was no day for men... some have said that there is [[Father's Day]], but what about young boys, teenagers and men who are not fathers?\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Dr. Teelucksingh, understanding the importance of celebrating good male role models, felt that his own father had been an example of an excellent role model and so chose 19 November partly because this was his father's birthday, and also because it was the date on which a local sporting team in his country created a level of unity with transcended gender, religious and ethnic divisions.<ref>Dr. Teelucksingh, J.

The commemorations were held at Chibuku Stadium in Chitungwiza under the theme Giving The Boy Child The Best Possible Start In Life. Fred Misi, the chairman of Men's Forum Varume Svinurai/Vhukhani said the commemorations came at a time when attention was being given to the girl child at the expense of boys, and noted, \"Whilst it is important to focus on the specific needs of the girl child, we are creating a crisis by ignoring the specific needs of the boy child.\" Misi highlighted the growing trend that many boys were dropping out of school and were hooked on hard drugs as well as abusing alcohol, while a significant number of those who were completed secondary and tertiary education were roaming the streets because of unemployment. He added the government and Zimbabweans needed to act immediately. A number of prominent persons attended and gave papers on the need to give the boy child assistance. There was drama and poetry from various groups and individual high school students in line with the theme of the celebrations, and the Zimbabwe Minister of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development, Olivia Muchena gave a key note address in which she said, \"It is an occasion for men to celebrate their achievements and contributions, in particular their contributions to community, family, marriage and child care while highlighting the discrimination against them...

One of the International Men's Day themes promoted was to help foster youth to unlock their creative identities to allow them to share their gifts with peers, family and the community, and to be seen and heard for who they are and not how they are perceived. The primary event was a gala dinner titled \"One moment for Change\" to highlight men's potential and the increasing capabilities of men as innovators of society. The dinner was held to raise funds to cover six months music tuition fees for a group of 20 children from the SOS Children's Village whom IMD ambassadors have adopted as part of a mentoring programme for children. Standard Chartered Bank sponsored the dinner, which included a range of iconic speakers who shared their experience and insights with the audience. Standard Chartered Bank Acting CEO Mr Michael Wiegand opened the event by sharing best practices that Standard Chartered Bank uses to address legitimate issues faced by male employees, including the fact that Standard Chartered Bank is the first company in Botswana to offer paternity leave which, he stated, made their male employees feel valued and that they were working for a 21st-century organization. Mr Tebogo Sebego, senior partner at Sebego & Sharma Attorneys and former chairperson of the Law Society of Botswana gave a keynote speech where he emphasized how the child protection laws should be improved, how the society play a role in creating a safe environment for the future generation of men. Mrs Tjipo Mothobi, Director, GBC Health South Africa gave an address on business collective effort. The District Commissioner in his closing remarks made an announcement that by end of December he was convening a meeting with men in the City where they will engage in dialogue on how they can collectively address the issues and challenges men and boys face.

The report referenced the fact that the issued train notice and communication with ARTC train control reflected a change and also specified a {{convert|15|km/h|mph}} speed limit for entry into the loop, and a limit of {{convert|35|km/h|mph}} for exiting the loop.\n\nThe final report is expected to take 18 months to complete.<ref name=Age230220/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{2020 railway accidents}}\n\n[[Category:Derailments in Australia]]\n[[Category:February 2020 events in Australia]]\n[[Category:NSW TrainLink]]\n[[Category:Railway accidents in 2020]]\n\n{{Use Australian English|date=February 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Heyitsstevo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAftermath", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Wallan_derailment"}
