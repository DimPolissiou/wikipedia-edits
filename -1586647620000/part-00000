The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually fielding six players at a time: one [[goaltender]], and five players who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck and score [[Goal (ice hockey)|goals]] against the opposing team.\n\nIce hockey is most popular in [[Ice hockey in Canada|Canada]], central and eastern [[Europe]], the [[Nordic countries]], [[Russia]], and the [[Ice hockey in the United States|United States]]. Ice hockey is the official [[National sport|national winter sport]] of Canada.<ref>[[s:National Sports of Canada Act|National Sports of Canada Act]]</ref> In addition, ice hockey is the most popular winter [[sport in Belarus]], [[Sport in Croatia|Croatia]], the [[Sport in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Sport in Finland|Finland]], [[Sport in Latvia|Latvia]], [[sport in Russia|Russia]], [[sport in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Sport in Sweden|Sweden]], and [[sport in Switzerland|Switzerland]]. [[North America]]'s [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) is the highest level for men's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world. The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) is the highest league in Russia and much of [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey, with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the [[IIHF World Ranking]]. Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=IIHF |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/ |title=The world governing body |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Canada, the United States, Nordic countries, and some other European countries the sport is known simply as '''hockey'''; the name \"ice hockey\" is used in places where \"hockey\" more often refers to the more popular [[field hockey]], such as countries in [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Ice hockey in Africa|Africa]], [[Australasia]], and some European countries including the [[Sport in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Sport in Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Sport in the Netherlands|Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Koninklijke Nederlandse Hockey Bond |url=https://hockey.nl/de-sport/organisatie/koninklijke-nederlandse-hockey-bond/ |accessdate=October 20, 2018 |agency=Hockey.nl}}</ref>\n\nIce hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as [[shinny]] and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] during the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]) predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953.<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[World Cup of Hockey]] is organized by the National Hockey League and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championship]] medals were awarded to one of these six countries. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian national team]] or the [[United States women's national ice hockey team|United States national team]] have between them won every gold medal of either series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/women.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Women |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/olympics/women.html |title=Olympic Ice Hockey Tournaments: All Medalists:Women |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n==={{anchor|Naming}}Name===\nIn England, field hockey has historically been called simply \"hockey\" and what was referenced by first appearances in print.

In Europe, these games included the Irish game of [[hurling]], the closely related Scottish game of [[shinty]] and versions of [[field hockey]] (including [[bandy|bandy ball]], played in England). [[IJscolf]], a game resembling [[Kolven|colf]] on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the [[Low Countries]] between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It was played with a wooden curved bat (called a ''colf'' or ''kolf''), a wooden or leather ball and two poles (or nearby landmarks), with the objective to hit the chosen point using the least number of strokes. A similar game (''[[knattleikr]]'') had been played for a thousand years or more by the [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian]] peoples, as documented in the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]].

William Pierre Le Cocq stated, in a 1799 letter written in [[Chesham]], England:\n\n<blockquote>I must now describe to you the game of Hockey; we have each a stick turning up at the end.

The British [English] played bandy, the Scots played shinty and golf, the Irish, hurling, while the Dutch soldiers probably pursued ''ken jaegen''. Curiosity led some to try lacrosse. Each group learned the game from the others. The most daring ventured to play on skates.\nAll these contributions nourished a game that was evolving. Hockey was invented by all these people, all these cultures, all these individuals. Hockey is the conclusion of all these beginnings.|[[Roch Carrier]], \"Hockey: Canada's Game\", in ''Vancouver 2010 Official Souvenir Program'', pg 42.}} In 1825, [[John Franklin]] wrote \"The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport\" on [[Great Bear Lake]] during one of his [[Arctic]] expeditions. A mid-1830s watercolour portrays New Brunswick lieutenant-governor Archibald Campbell and his family with British soldiers on skates playing a stick-on-ice sport. Captain R.G.A. Levinge, a British Army officer in New Brunswick during Campbell's time, wrote about \"hockey on ice\" on Chippewa Creek (a tributary of the Niagara River) in 1839. In 1843 another British Army officer in [[Kingston, Ontario]] wrote, \"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"<ref name=\"queens\"/> An 1859 ''Boston Evening Gazette'' article referred to an early game of hockey on ice in Halifax that year.<ref name=\"origin\" /> An 1835 painting by John O'Toole depicts skaters with sticks and bung on a frozen stream in the American state of [[West Virginia]], at that time still part of [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"cancom\"/>\n\nIn the same era, the [[Mi'kmaq]], a [[First Nations]] people of the [[The Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], also had a stick-and-ball game.

By 1902, the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league\u2014the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL)\u2014in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used.

During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n[[File:Dynamo Stadium - Ice hockey arena - Panorama after match.jpg|thumb|left|[[VTB Arena]] is an example of an indoor ice hockey arena. The arena is used by [[HC Dynamo Moscow]].]]\nHockey is an [[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]] game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[short-handed]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n[[File:Military appreciation night South Carolina Stingrays.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] perform a line change. A line change is a substitution of an entire [[line (ice hockey)|line]] at once.]] \nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [[bodycheck]] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [[faceoff]]. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''offside'', ''icing'', and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the [[Plexiglas|glass]], or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n[[File:GM Place Canucks 4 Overtimes.jpg|thumb|left|Scoreboard for a hockey game that ended in the seventh period. If a game is tied at the end of the third period, several leagues and tournaments have teams play additional periods until a goal is scored.]]\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom the 1999\u20132000 until the 2003\u201304 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an ''empty net'' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|Several leagues and tournaments have implemented the [[shootout (hockey)|shootout]] as a means to determine a winner, if the game remains tied after an extra overtime period]]\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Richard Gynge going to penalty box.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An ice hockey player enters the penalty box. Players may be sent to the [[penalty box]] for rule infractions, forcing their team playing with one less player for a specified time.]]\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing ''short-handed'' while the opposing team is on a ''[[power play (sport)|power play]]''.\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]], [[elbow (strike)|elbowing]], [[roughing]], [[high-sticking]], [[delay of game|delay of the game]], [[too many men|too many players on the ice]], [[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]], illegal equipment, [[charging (ice hockey)|charging]] (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]], [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]], kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or [[cross-checking]]. As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [[diving (ice hockey)|diving]], where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n[[File:Joel Larsson and Davis Dryden.jpg|thumb|upright|A hockey skater [[Hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] another skater with his stick in an attempt to restrain him. Hooking is a rule infraction and may result in a minor penalty.]]\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the [[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]. Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]''. Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|Officials working under a four-official system. Orange armbands are worn by the referees to distinguish them from the lineswomen.]]\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system\", that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system\", where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Injury}} Injury ==\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players are allowed to contact other players but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood. Direct trauma to the head is estimated to account for 80% of all hockey injuries as a result of player contact with other players or hockey equipment.<ref name=\"hughston.com\"/>\n\nOne of the leading causes of head injury is body checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head.\n\nThe most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare.\n\n==Tactics==\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Body checking lesson.jpg|thumb|Youths being taught how to properly deliver a check in ice hockey]]\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660199222).jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[National Hockey League|NHL]] fan exhibit, where visitors attempt to deflect the puck off the skaters in front of the goalie in order to score]]\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy\", is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling\", which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\n[[File:Fight in ice hockey 2009.JPG|thumb|Fighting in ice hockey is officially prohibited in the rules, although it continues to be an established tradition in the sport in North America]]\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned.

A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit.

Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There have been two major professional women's hockey leagues to have paid its players: the [[National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the United States and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada, China, and the United States.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa.

The league's history began after Canada's National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams by 1942\u201343. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref> The league is expected to expand to 32 teams by 2021.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.\n\nAs of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the [[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL), [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH), and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).\n[[File:2007 Memorial Cup warmup.JPG|thumb|Pre-game warmups prior to a [[Memorial Cup]] game. The tourney serves as the championship for the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]].]]\n[[U Sports]] ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, however, they do get a stipend and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the [[NHL draft]]s many players directly from the major junior leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in [[College ice hockey#NCAA|NCAA ice hockey]].\n\n====Eurasia====\n[[File:Stamp-russia2016-hockey-gagarin-cup.png|thumb|A Russian stamp commemorating the [[Gagarin Cup]], which is presented to the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]'s playoff champion. The KHL is the largest ice hockey league in Eurasia.]]\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The KHL currently comprises member clubs based in [[Belarus]] (1), [[China]] (1), [[Finland]] (1), [[Latvia]] (1), [[Kazakhstan]] (1) and [[Russia]] (19) for a total of 24.\n\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lineup (5154107439).jpg|thumb|Players from the [[ZSC Lions]] line up prior to a game. The club plays in the Swiss [[National League A]].]]\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the European Trophy, [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n====Other regions====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national leagues, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:OvechkinKuba2010WinterOlympics.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian men's hockey team]] moves the puck as [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic's]] [[Filip Kuba]] defends against him, during the 2010 Olympics]]\nIce hockey has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. The United States won its first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]], amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n[[File:IIHF16WC - Game FIN v BLR.jpg|thumb|Skaters from the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish]] and [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belorussian men's ice hockey teams]] shortly after a [[face-off]] during the [[2016 IIHF World Championship]].

In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The only finals in the women's world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden and [[2019 IIHF Women's World Championship Final|2019 World Championship final]] between the US and Finland.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]].

These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as [[shinny]] and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] during the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]) predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953.<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[World Cup of Hockey]] is organized by the National Hockey League and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championship]] medals were awarded to one of these six countries.

The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF<ref>{{cite book |last=International Ice Hockey Federation |authorlink=International Ice Hockey Federation |title=Official Rule Book 2002\u20132006 |date=September 2002 |url=http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319080459/http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2006}}</ref> and the NHL.<ref>{{cite book |last=National Hockey League |authorlink=National Hockey League |title=Official Rules 2006\u201307 |publisher=Triumph Books |year=2006 |location=Chicago |url=http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090303204304/http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |isbn=1-894801-03-2 |format=PDF |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both of the codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th Century.\n\nIce hockey is played on a ''[[hockey rink]]''. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n[[File:Dynamo Stadium - Ice hockey arena - Panorama after match.jpg|thumb|left|[[VTB Arena]] is an example of an indoor ice hockey arena. The arena is used by [[HC Dynamo Moscow]].]]\nHockey is an [[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]] game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[short-handed]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n[[File:Military appreciation night South Carolina Stingrays.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] perform a line change. A line change is a substitution of an entire [[line (ice hockey)|line]] at once.]] \nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [[bodycheck]] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [[faceoff]]. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''offside'', ''icing'', and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the [[Plexiglas|glass]], or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n[[File:GM Place Canucks 4 Overtimes.jpg|thumb|left|Scoreboard for a hockey game that ended in the seventh period. If a game is tied at the end of the third period, several leagues and tournaments have teams play additional periods until a goal is scored.]]\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom the 1999\u20132000 until the 2003\u201304 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an ''empty net'' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|Several leagues and tournaments have implemented the [[shootout (hockey)|shootout]] as a means to determine a winner, if the game remains tied after an extra overtime period]]\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Richard Gynge going to penalty box.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An ice hockey player enters the penalty box. Players may be sent to the [[penalty box]] for rule infractions, forcing their team playing with one less player for a specified time.]]\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing ''short-handed'' while the opposing team is on a ''[[power play (sport)|power play]]''.\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]], [[elbow (strike)|elbowing]], [[roughing]], [[high-sticking]], [[delay of game|delay of the game]], [[too many men|too many players on the ice]], [[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]], illegal equipment, [[charging (ice hockey)|charging]] (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]], [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]], kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or [[cross-checking]]. As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [[diving (ice hockey)|diving]], where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n[[File:Joel Larsson and Davis Dryden.jpg|thumb|upright|A hockey skater [[Hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] another skater with his stick in an attempt to restrain him. Hooking is a rule infraction and may result in a minor penalty.]]\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the [[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]. Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]''. Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|Officials working under a four-official system. Orange armbands are worn by the referees to distinguish them from the lineswomen.]]\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system\", that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system\", where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Injury}} Injury ==\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players are allowed to contact other players but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood.

Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head.\n\nThe most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare.\n\n==Tactics==\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Body checking lesson.jpg|thumb|Youths being taught how to properly deliver a check in ice hockey]]\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660199222).jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[National Hockey League|NHL]] fan exhibit, where visitors attempt to deflect the puck off the skaters in front of the goalie in order to score]]\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy\", is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling\", which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\n[[File:Fight in ice hockey 2009.JPG|thumb|Fighting in ice hockey is officially prohibited in the rules, although it continues to be an established tradition in the sport in North America]]\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. [[enforcer (ice hockey)|Enforcers]] and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Women's ice hockey}} Women's ice hockey ==\nIce hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing by 400 percent from 1995 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Canada |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |accessdate=December 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927042219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |archivedate=September 27, 2004}}</ref> In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html |title=IIHF About Hockey Canada |publisher=Iihf.com |date=April 26, 1920 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> United States had 65,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html |title=IIHF About United States |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Finland 4,760,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html |title=IIHF About Finland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=February 10, 1928 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Sweden 3,075<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html |title=IIHF About Sweden |publisher=Iihf.com |date=March 23, 1912 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> and Switzerland 1,172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/switzerland.html |title=IIHF About Switzerland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=November 23, 1908 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), [[Western Women's Hockey League]], [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), [[Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and [[recreation]]al teams.

Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There have been two major professional women's hockey leagues to have paid its players: the [[National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the United States and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada, China, and the United States.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa.

The league's history began after Canada's National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams by 1942\u201343. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref> The league is expected to expand to 32 teams by 2021.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.\n\nAs of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the [[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL), [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH), and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).\n[[File:2007 Memorial Cup warmup.JPG|thumb|Pre-game warmups prior to a [[Memorial Cup]] game. The tourney serves as the championship for the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]].]]\n[[U Sports]] ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, however, they do get a stipend and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the [[NHL draft]]s many players directly from the major junior leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in [[College ice hockey#NCAA|NCAA ice hockey]].\n\n====Eurasia====\n[[File:Stamp-russia2016-hockey-gagarin-cup.png|thumb|A Russian stamp commemorating the [[Gagarin Cup]], which is presented to the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]'s playoff champion. The KHL is the largest ice hockey league in Eurasia.]]\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The number of teams has since increased to 28 from eight different countries.\n\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lineup (5154107439).jpg|thumb|Players from the [[ZSC Lions]] line up prior to a game. The club plays in the Swiss [[National League A]].]]\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the European Trophy, [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n====Other regions====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national leagues, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:OvechkinKuba2010WinterOlympics.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian men's hockey team]] moves the puck as [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic's]] [[Filip Kuba]] defends against him, during the 2010 Olympics]]\nIce hockey has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. The United States won its first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]], amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n[[File:IIHF16WC - Game FIN v BLR.jpg|thumb|Skaters from the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish]] and [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belorussian men's ice hockey teams]] shortly after a [[face-off]] during the [[2016 IIHF World Championship]]. The IIHF is an annual national team tournament.]]\nThe [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The only finals in the women's world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden and [[2019 IIHF Women's World Championship Final|2019 World Championship final]] between the US and Finland.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]]. The annual [[Euro Hockey Tour]], an unofficial European championship between the national men's teams of the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden have been played since 1996\u201397.\n\n===Attendance records===\n{{Main|List of ice hockey games with highest attendance}}\n[[File:TheBigChillattheBigHouse.JPG|thumb|[[The Big Chill at the Big House]] was a collegiate ice hockey game played at [[Michigan Stadium]] in 2010.

Pond hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, puckhandling and passing abilities. Since 2002, the [[World Pond Hockey Championship]] has been played on Roulston Lake in [[Plaster Rock]], New Brunswick, Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the World Pond Hockey Championship |url=http://worldpondhockey.ca/en/home/history |website=worldpondhockey.ca |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref> Since 2006, the [[US Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the [[Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Huntsville, Ontario.\n\n===Sledge hockey===\n{{Main|Sledge hockey}}\nSledge hockey is an adaption of ice hockey designed for players who have a physical disability.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

[[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]].

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur and then go on to win the Masters as a professional. These players are [[Cary Middlecoff]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable
