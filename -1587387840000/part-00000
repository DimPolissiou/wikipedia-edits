The population was 20,033 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city has a symphony orchestra and chorus.\n\n==History==\nLebanon is in the [[Symmes Purchase]]. The first European settler in what is now Lebanon was Ichabod Corwin uncle of Ohio Governor Thomas Corwin who came to Ohio from [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon County]], [[Kentucky]] and settled on the north branch of [[Turtle Creek (Little Miami River)|Turtle Creek]] in March 1796. The site of his cabin is now on the grounds of Berry Intermediate School on North Broadway and is marked with a monument erected by the Warren County Historical Society.\n\nThe town was laid out in September 1802 on land owned by Ichabod Corwin, Silas Hurin, Ephraim Hathaway, and Samuel Manning in Sections 35 and 35 of Town 5, Range 3 North and Sections 5 and 6 of Town 4, Range 3 North of the Between the Miami Rivers Survey. Lebanon was named after the Biblical [[Lebanon]] because of the many [[Eastern Juniper|juniper]] or Eastern Red cedar trees there, similar to the [[Lebanon Cedar]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n132 183]}}</ref> It is known today as \"The Cedar City\".\n\nCity legend has it that Lebanon didn't grow as large as Cincinnati or Dayton because of the 'Shaker Curse.' During their migration, the Shakers decided an area outside of town was a suitable place for them to create a homeland for themselves. There was a disagreement with some of the locals and it was said the Shakers placed a curse on the city to hinder the city's prosperity. In reality, the Shakers thrived in the area, and built a settlement about 4 miles west of Lebanon called Union Village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historiclebanonohio.com/?q=book/export/html/43|title=Text Timeline|website=www.historiclebanonohio.com|accessdate=Feb 18, 2020}}</ref> A local man, Malchalm Worley was their first convert. Since the Shakers did not engage in procreation, they relied on converts to increase their numbers. By 1900, there were almost no Shakers left in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Shakers?rec=630|title=Shakers - Ohio History Central|website=ohiohistorycentral.org|accessdate=Feb 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe city is one of the few in the nation to once operate a government-run [[cable television]] and [[telephone]] service, as well as being a fiber-to-the-neighborhood [[Internet service provider]]. Controversial since it began operation in 1999, the Lebanon telecommunications system had struggled to recover its expenses and had accumulated over $8 million in debt. However, residents in the area at the time paid up to 50% less for the aforementioned services than neighboring communities, therefore saving over $40 million of the residents' money. In the 2006 general election, however, voters approved the sale of this city-run telecommunications system to [[Cincinnati Bell]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.97|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|12.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-07-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 1079\n|1830= 1165\n|1840= 1528\n|1850= 2088\n|1860= 2559\n|1870= 2749\n|1880= 2703\n|1890= 3050\n|1900= 2867\n|1910= 2698\n|1920= 3396\n|1930= 3222\n|1940= 3896\n|1950= 4818\n|1960= 5993\n|1970= 7934\n|1980= 9620\n|1990= 10453\n|2000= 16962\n|2010= 20033\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=20727\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=Census1870>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a_08.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Census1880>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-11.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1910>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=1910 U.S. Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 20,033 people, 7,436 households, and 5,213 families living in the city.

The first European settler in what is now Lebanon was Ichabod Corwin uncle of Ohio Governor Thomas Corwin who came to Ohio from [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon County]], [[Kentucky]] and settled on the north branch of [[Turtle Creek (Little Miami River)|Turtle Creek]] in March 1796. The site of his cabin is now on the grounds of Berry Intermediate School on North Broadway and is marked with a monument erected by the Warren County Historical Society.\n\nThe town was laid out in September 1802 on land owned by Ichabod Corwin, Silas Hurin, Ephraim Hathaway, and Samuel Manning in Sections 35 and 35 of Town 5, Range 3 North and Sections 5 and 6 of Town 4, Range 3 North of the Between the Miami Rivers Survey. Lebanon was named after the Biblical [[Lebanon]] because of the many [[Eastern Juniper|juniper]] or Eastern Red cedar trees there, similar to the [[Lebanon Cedar]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n132 183]}}</ref> It is known today as \"The Cedar City\".\n\nCity legend has it that Lebanon didn't grow as large as Cincinnati or Dayton because of the 'Shaker Curse.' During their migration, the Shakers decided an area outside of town was a suitable place for them to create a homeland for themselves. There was a disagreement with some of the locals and it was said the Shakers placed a curse on the city to hinder the city's prosperity. In reality, the Shakers thrived in the area, and built a settlement about 4 miles west of Lebanon called Union Village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historiclebanonohio.com/?q=book/export/html/43|title=Text Timeline|website=www.historiclebanonohio.com|accessdate=Feb 18, 2020}}</ref> A local man, Malchalm Worley was their first convert. Since the Shakers did not engage in procreation, they relied on converts to increase their numbers. By 1900, there were almost no Shakers left in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Shakers?rec=630|title=Shakers - Ohio History Central|website=ohiohistorycentral.org|accessdate=Feb 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe city is one of the few in the nation to once operate a government-run [[cable television]] and [[telephone]] service, as well as being a fiber-to-the-neighborhood [[Internet service provider]]. Controversial since it began operation in 1999, the Lebanon telecommunications system had struggled to recover its expenses and had accumulated over $8 million in debt. However, residents in the area at the time paid up to 50% less for the aforementioned services than neighboring communities, therefore saving over $40 million of the residents' money. In the 2006 general election, however, voters approved the sale of this city-run telecommunications system to [[Cincinnati Bell]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.97|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|12.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-07-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 1079\n|1830= 1165\n|1840= 1528\n|1850= 2088\n|1860= 2559\n|1870= 2749\n|1880= 2703\n|1890= 3050\n|1900= 2867\n|1910= 2698\n|1920= 3396\n|1930= 3222\n|1940= 3896\n|1950= 4818\n|1960= 5993\n|1970= 7934\n|1980= 9620\n|1990= 10453\n|2000= 16962\n|2010= 20033\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=20727\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=Census1870>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a_08.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Census1880>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-11.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1910>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=1910 U.S. Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 20,033 people, 7,436 households, and 5,213 families living in the city.
