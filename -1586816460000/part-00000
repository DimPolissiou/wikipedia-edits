It was the last site in the former New Spain to be held by Spain and was surrendered to General [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]] in November 1825. The Spanish forces were expelled by President [[Vicente Guerrero]] after the failed attempt at re-conquering the country.\n\nSince then, San Juan de Ul\u00faa served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the nineteenth century. In 1836 the French invaded and occupied to put pressure on the national government; during the Mexican\u2013American War, in 1847-48 the U.S. occupied the fort and Veracruz, and in 1863 the French briefly occupied the city when installing Maximilian I as emperor.

The [[UN]] report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref>\n\nAt the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the [[United Nations Department of Economic Affairs]] (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN [[E-Government]] Survey.

These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).\nColleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Constance|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Engagement and the Transition to Adulthood|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=159\u201379|pmid=20364626|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0043}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment (TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. <ref>Clifford P. Harbour. (2016). Civic Engagement and Cosmopolitan Leadership.

Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.\n\nOnline engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their [[local government]] that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming [[advocacy group]]s pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engaging the Public at a Local Level to Strengthen Civic Engagement|url=http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|publisher=San Antonio Area Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191630/http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==In the role of state government==\nCivic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.\n\nCivic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.\n\n===Application in health===\nStates implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\".<ref>Szilagyi, Peter G., et al. \"Evaluation of a state health insurance program for low-income children: implications for state child health insurance programs.\" ''Pediatrics'' 105.2 (2000): 363\u201371</ref> States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.\n\n===In comparison with other countries===\nStates practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol,  the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\">Litva, Andrea, et al. \"'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of health-care decision making.\" ''Social Science & Medicine'' 54.12 (2002): 1825\u201337.</ref>\n\nTheir research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\" /> The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.\n\n===Importance of voter turnout===\n[[File:I voted on November 8 2016.jpg|thumb|Voter turn out sticker]]\nThe goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement.

One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.<ref>Shah, D.

The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/four-ideas-on-how-tech-can-increase-civic-engagement|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.\n\nThere are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] from [[SNSPA]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/|title=SNSPA \u2013 Center for Civic Participation and Democracy|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and [[European Union|European]] level.Created at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration|National School of Political Science and Public Administration]], CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of ''School of governance''.

According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Civic readiness: Preparing toddlers and young children for civic education and sustained engagement|author=Kelly, DC|journal=National Civic Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=97|issue= 4|pages=55\u201359|doi=10.1002/ncr.234}}</ref>   Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school.  Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.\n\nTo answer this challenge, the incorporation of [[service-learning]] into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners.<ref>Prentice, M. & G. Robinson (2010) ''Linking Service Learning and Civic Engagement in Community College Students''.

Edwin Fogelman, author of ''Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,'' states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.<ref>Fogelman, Edwin. \"Civic Engagement At The University Of Minnesota.\" ''Journal of Public Affairs'' 6.(2002): 103.

Putnam argued that despite rapid increases in higher education opportunities that may foster civic engagement, Americans were dropping out of political and organized community life. A number of studies suggested that while more youth are volunteering, fewer are voting or becoming politically engaged.<ref>Putnam, R. (2000). ''Bowling Alone.''

The [[UN]] report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref>\n\nAt the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the [[United Nations Department of Economic Affairs]] (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN [[E-Government]] Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html|title=Home - UNV Online Volunteering service}}</ref>\u2014more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries\u2014mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nCivic engagement can foster [[community]] participation and government involvement.\n\nAccording to ICMA: Leaders at the Core of Better Communities, these are the benefits of civic engagement:<ref>\"How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships.\" ''How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships'' 43 (2011): n.p. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref>\n\n* Achieving greater buy-in to decisions with fewer backlashes such as lawsuits, special elections, or a council recall.\n* Engendering trust between citizens and government, which improves public behavior at council meetings. \n* Attaining successful outcomes on toxic issues, which helps elected officials avoid choosing between equally unappealing solutions. \n* Developing better and more creative ideas and solutions. \n* Implementing ideas, programs, and [[policies]] faster and more easily. \n* Creating involved citizens instead of demanding customers. \n* Building community within a city. \n* Making your job easier and more relaxing.\n\n== Local civic engagement ==\nWhen those who serve listen to the citizens, they become better informed of what is needed by the community and generally make better decisions.  Miriam Porter states that elected officials should communicate with their citizens to have this better understanding, \"Without this, turmoil, suspicion, and reduction of public trust ensues\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=25038780&site=eds-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login}}</ref>\n\nVolunteering personal time to community projects is widely believed to support the growth of a community as a whole. [[Community engagement]] could be found at: Food pantries, community clean-up programs and the like can bolster efforts to create a strong community bond.\n\n===Community collaboration===\nCommunity [[collaboration]] includes democratic spaces where people are open to discuss concerns for particular issues regarding [[public interest]] and means to make the changes necessary. These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).\nColleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Constance|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Engagement and the Transition to Adulthood|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=159\u201379|pmid=20364626|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0043}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment (TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. <ref>Clifford P. Harbour. (2016). Civic Engagement and Cosmopolitan Leadership. En Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement (51\u201359). Estados Unidos: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ref>\n\nPolitical participation is another key element that is practiced with regularity. Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.\n\nOnline engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their [[local government]] that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming [[advocacy group]]s pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engaging the Public at a Local Level to Strengthen Civic Engagement|url=http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|publisher=San Antonio Area Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191630/http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==In the role of state government==\nCivic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.\n\nCivic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.\n\n===Application in health===\nStates implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\".<ref>Szilagyi, Peter G., et al. \"Evaluation of a state health insurance program for low-income children: implications for state child health insurance programs.\" ''Pediatrics'' 105.2 (2000): 363\u201371</ref> States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.\n\n===In comparison with other countries===\nStates practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol,  the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\">Litva, Andrea, et al. \"'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of health-care decision making.\" ''Social Science & Medicine'' 54.12 (2002): 1825\u201337.</ref>\n\nTheir research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\" /> The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.\n\n===Importance of voter turnout===\n[[File:I voted on November 8 2016.jpg|thumb|Voter turn out sticker]]\nThe goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement.

In their study they sampled a small group from a metropolitan area, the difference between both generations varies as the children who were in high school which is 87.5% were stated to be civically engaged.

One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.<ref>Shah, D.

The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/four-ideas-on-how-tech-can-increase-civic-engagement|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.\n\nThere are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] from [[SNSPA]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/|title=SNSPA \u2013 Center for Civic Participation and Democracy|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and [[European Union|European]] level.Created at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration|National School of Political Science and Public Administration]], CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of ''School of governance''.

According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Civic readiness: Preparing toddlers and young children for civic education and sustained engagement|author=Kelly, DC|journal=National Civic Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=97|issue= 4|pages=55\u201359|doi=10.1002/ncr.234}}</ref>   Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school.  Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.\n\nTo answer this challenge, the incorporation of [[service-learning]] into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners.<ref>Prentice, M. & G. Robinson (2010) ''Linking Service Learning and Civic Engagement in Community College Students''.

Edwin Fogelman, author of ''Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,'' states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.<ref>Fogelman, Edwin. \"Civic Engagement At The University Of Minnesota.\" ''Journal of Public Affairs'' 6.(2002): 103.

Bryan; August 11, 1836 \u2013 December 22, 1919) was an American poet.  Her publishing career began in the mid-1850s and lasted into the twentieth century.  She published hundreds of poems in widely-circulating newspapers, magazines, and anthologies as well as in eighteen volumes of poems, two of which she co-authored with her husband, the poet John James Piatt (also known as \u201cJ.J.\u201d).<ref>Paula Bernat Bennett, ed., ''Palace-Burner: The Selected Poetry of Sarah Piatt'' (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xvii-xviii; xxiv-xxv; \u201cSarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919),\u201d Faith Barrett and Christanne Miller, eds., ''\u201cWords for the Hour\u201d: A New Anthology of American Civil War Poetry'' (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 331; Karen L.

Prentice]], writer, poet, and editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]],'' encountered Piatt's poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\"{{sfn|The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, Volume 3|1891|p=401}} Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She also began sending her work to <i>The [[New York Ledger]]</i>, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.<ref>''The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860'' Professor Elizabeth Renker, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nOn June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \"J.J.\"), whom she had met through Prentice.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} The couple relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} During this period they published a collection featuring both of their poetry, <i>The Nests at Washington</i> (1864). This was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 <i>Poems by Two Friends</i> with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first.{{sfn|Ridpath|Ridpath Library of Universal Literature, Volume 18|1899|p=n.p.}}\n\nIn July 1867, they moved to [[Ohio]], where J.J. worked for [[Cincinnati]] newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[North Bend, Ohio]], a few miles south of [[Cincinnati]], on the [[Ohio River]]. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions,{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870-1876, Piatt and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}} During this time, Sarah's poems also appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper <i>The Capital</i>, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.<ref>''The Capital, 1871-1880 (Sarah Piatt Recovery Project), The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nHer first independent collection of poetry, ''A Woman's Poems'', appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, ''The Echo Club''.{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}} The volume was followed several more, including ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles'' (1874); ''That New World'' (1876); ''Poems in Company with Children'' (1877); and ''Dramatic Persons and Moods'' (1878). During this period, Piatt also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]].''{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S. to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a job he held for eleven years.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including ''An Irish Garland'' ([[Edinburgh]], 1884), a volume of her ''Selected Poems'' ([[London]], 1885), ''In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland'' (London, 1886), ''The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems'' (London, 1889), and ''An Irish Wild-Flower'' (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=570}} Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, ''The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses'' (Edinburgh, 1884).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nPiatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others in infancy or through miscarriage. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland.{{sfn|Michaels|1999|p=11-12}}\n\nAfter J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt removed to her son Cecil's home in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]], where she died of [[pneumonia]] on December 22, 1919.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}{{sfn|McHenry|1980|p=327}} She and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}}\n\n==Themes and reception==\nChildren were a common theme in Piatt's poems.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=134}}\n\nHer biographer, in [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]'s ''Poets' Homes'', stated:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}} {{quote|text=\"It is since her marriage, in June, 1861,\" says Mrs.  \"that her more individual characteristics of style have manifested themselves, especially the dramatic element, so delicate, subtle and strong, which asserts her intellectual kinship with Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\"}}\n\nWrites [[William Dean Howells]]:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}} {{quote|text=\"In the rush of these hopeless tears, this heart-broken scorn of comfort, this unreconcilable patience of grief, is the drama of the race's affliction; in the utter desolation of one woman's sorrow, the universal anguish of mortality is expressed. It is not pessimism; it does not assume to be any sort of philosophy or system; it is simply the bitter truth, to a phrase, of human experience through which all men must pass, and the reader need not be told that such poems were lived before they were written.\"}}\n\nAnother admirer of Piatt's verse, in a critical survey of the literature of Ohio, (1903) said of the author and her work:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}{{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius \u2014 a poet whose name shines in American literature, 'Like some great jewel full of fire.' She is unrivaled, in her province of song, by any living writer of her sex, whether native to this country or of foreign birth. . . . She is inimitable in her own vivid, bold, and suggestive invention and manner. Whatever she writes has meaning \u2014 and the significance is often deep \u2014 sometimes strange and elusive \u2014 never commonplace. . . . Mrs. Piatt's rare artistic skill has been admired by many who appreciate the technical difficulties of the poetic craft.\"}}\n\nEqually emphatic is the praise accorded by a contemporary English critic, who, in an article contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|London Saturday Review]]'', commenting on the volume of select verse entitled ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles, and Other Poems,'' said:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}  {{quote|text=\"Of all the concourse of women singers Mrs. Piatt is the most racy and, in a word, the most American. . . . The new selections of her poems should be most welcome to all who seek in American poetry something more than a pale reflex of the British commodity. . . . Her poems, with all their whim and inconstancy of mood, are charmingly sincere, artless, piquant, and full of quaint surprise.\"}}\n\nIn like commendatory strain, another English critic, reviewing the same book in the ''Pictorial World'' (London), pronounced her verse, \"not easy to equal, much less to surpass, on either side of the Atlantic,\" and characterized her poetical achievement in the following words:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=185}} {{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt studies no model, and takes no pattern for her work; she simply expresses herself; hence her verse is just the transparent mantle of her individuality. The natural refinement, the ready sympathy, the tender sentiment, the quiet grace of a thoroughly womanly woman reveal themselves quite unconsciously in every poem; and the musical quality of the verse increases the impression that the reader is listening to the heartutterances of one of the Imogens or Mirandas to be met with now seldom outside the radiant land where Shakespeare's imagination reigns supreme. . . . Mrs. Piatt will, we doubt not, as her poems become known to English readers, become popular, or, we should rather say, dear to a wide circle mainly composed of members of her own sex, for she supplies the adequate expression for women whose hearts are tender and true like her own.\"}}\n\n==Selected works==\n* '' A Woman's Poems.'' 1871\n* ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles.'' 1874\n* ''That New World, & Other Poems.'' 1877\n* ''Poems in Company with Children.

Bryan; August 11, 1836 \u2013 December 22, 1919) was an American poet.  Her publishing career began in the mid-1850s and lasted into the twentieth century.  She published hundreds of poems in widely-circulating newspapers, magazines, and anthologies as well as in eighteen volumes of poems, two of which she co-authored with her husband, the poet John James Piatt (also known as \u201cJ.J.\u201d).<ref>Paula Bernat Bennett, ed., ''Palace-Burner: The Selected Poetry of Sarah Piatt'' (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xvii-xviii; xxiv-xxv; \u201cSarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919),\u201d Faith Barrett and Christanne Miller, eds., ''\u201cWords for the Hour\u201d: A New Anthology of American Civil War Poetry'' (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 331; Karen L.

The loss had a profound impact on her life and outlook, as evident in her poetry. {{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=63}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\nShe then lived on various Kentucky plantations with relatives, accompanied by her mother's nurse, an African American slave.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} For a time, she lived with her grandmother, and then later went to live with her father at the home of his new wife.{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} Eventually, Piatt's father placed her and a younger sister in the care of their aunt, Mrs. Annie Boone, who lived in [[New Castle, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn New Castle, Piatt attended Henry Female College, graduating in 1854.<ref>Bennett, Introduction, 2001, p. xxiii</ref>{{sfn|Ridpath|1906|p=289}} She became an avid reader, and was especially fond of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Felicia Hemans]], and [[Robert Browning]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Renker|2016|p=236}} While a student, Piatt began publishing her poetry in the local newspaper.{{sfn|Larson|2011|p=189}}\n\n==Career==\nWhen [[George D. Prentice]], writer, poet, and editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]],'' encountered Piatt's poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\"{{sfn|The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, Volume 3|1891|p=401}} Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She also began sending her work to <i>The [[New York Ledger]]</i>, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.<ref>''The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860'' Professor Elizabeth Renker, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nOn June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \"J.J.\"), whom she had met through Prentice.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} The couple relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} During this period they published a collection featuring both of their poetry, <i>The Nests at Washington</i> (1864). This was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 <i>Poems by Two Friends</i> with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first.{{sfn|Ridpath|Ridpath Library of Universal Literature, Volume 18|1899|p=n.p.}}\n\nIn July 1867, they moved to [[Ohio]], where J.J. worked for [[Cincinnati]] newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[North Bend, Ohio]], a few miles south of [[Cincinnati]], on the [[Ohio River]]. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions,{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870-1876, Piatt and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}} During this time, Sarah's poems also appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper <i>The Capital</i>, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.<ref>''The Capital, 1871-1880 (Sarah Piatt Recovery Project), The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nHer first independent collection of poetry, ''A Woman's Poems'', appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, ''The Echo Club''.{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}} The volume was followed several more, including ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles'' (1874); ''That New World'' (1876); ''Poems in Company with Children'' (1877); and ''Dramatic Persons and Moods'' (1878). During this period, Piatt also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]].''{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S. to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a job he held for eleven years.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including ''An Irish Garland'' ([[Edinburgh]], 1884), a volume of her ''Selected Poems'' ([[London]], 1885), ''In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland'' (London, 1886), ''The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems'' (London, 1889), and ''An Irish Wild-Flower'' (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S. {{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=570}} Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, ''The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses'' (Edinburgh, 1884).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nPiatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others in infancy or through miscarriage. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland.  {{sfn|Michaels|1999|p=11-12}}\n\nAfter J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt removed to her son Cecil's home in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]], where she died of [[pneumonia]] on December 22, 1919.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}{{sfn|McHenry|1980|p=327}} She and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}}\n\n==Themes and reception==\nChildren were a common theme in Piatt's poems.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=134}}\n\nHer biographer, in [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]'s ''Poets' Homes'', stated:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}} {{quote|text=\"It is since her marriage, in June, 1861,\" says Mrs.  \"that her more individual characteristics of style have manifested themselves, especially the dramatic element, so delicate, subtle and strong, which asserts her intellectual kinship with Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\"}}\n\nWrites [[William Dean Howells]]:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}} {{quote|text=\"In the rush of these hopeless tears, this heart-broken scorn of comfort, this unreconcilable patience of grief, is the drama of the race's affliction; in the utter desolation of one woman's sorrow, the universal anguish of mortality is expressed. It is not pessimism; it does not assume to be any sort of philosophy or system; it is simply the bitter truth, to a phrase, of human experience through which all men must pass, and the reader need not be told that such poems were lived before they were written.\"}}\n\nAnother admirer of Piatt's verse, in a critical survey of the literature of Ohio, (1903) said of the author and her work:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}{{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius \u2014 a poet whose name shines in American literature, 'Like some great jewel full of fire.' She is unrivaled, in her province of song, by any living writer of her sex, whether native to this country or of foreign birth. . . . She is inimitable in her own vivid, bold, and suggestive invention and manner. Whatever she writes has meaning \u2014 and the significance is often deep \u2014 sometimes strange and elusive \u2014 never commonplace. . . . Mrs. Piatt's rare artistic skill has been admired by many who appreciate the technical difficulties of the poetic craft.\"}}\n\nEqually emphatic is the praise accorded by a contemporary English critic, who, in an article contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|London Saturday Review]]'', commenting on the volume of select verse entitled ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles, and Other Poems,'' said:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}  {{quote|text=\"Of all the concourse of women singers Mrs. Piatt is the most racy and, in a word, the most American. . . . The new selections of her poems should be most welcome to all who seek in American poetry something more than a pale reflex of the British commodity. . . . Her poems, with all their whim and inconstancy of mood, are charmingly sincere, artless, piquant, and full of quaint surprise.\"}}\n\nIn like commendatory strain, another English critic, reviewing the same book in the ''Pictorial World'' (London), pronounced her verse, \"not easy to equal, much less to surpass, on either side of the Atlantic,\" and characterized her poetical achievement in the following words:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=185}} {{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt studies no model, and takes no pattern for her work; she simply expresses herself; hence her verse is just the transparent mantle of her individuality. The natural refinement, the ready sympathy, the tender sentiment, the quiet grace of a thoroughly womanly woman reveal themselves quite unconsciously in every poem; and the musical quality of the verse increases the impression that the reader is listening to the heartutterances of one of the Imogens or Mirandas to be met with now seldom outside the radiant land where Shakespeare's imagination reigns supreme. . . . Mrs. Piatt will, we doubt not, as her poems become known to English readers, become popular, or, we should rather say, dear to a wide circle mainly composed of members of her own sex, for she supplies the adequate expression for women whose hearts are tender and true like her own.\"}}\n\n==Selected works==\n* '' A Woman's Poems.'' 1871\n* ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles.'' 1874\n* ''That New World, & Other Poems.'' 1877\n* ''Poems in Company with Children.

Therefore, it will return to its own zone. Below the corresponding electrical field for each zone]]\n'''Isotachophoresis''' ('''ITP''') is a technique in [[analytical chemistry]] used for selective separation and concentration of ionic [[analyte]]s. It is a form of [[electrophoresis]]; charged analytes are separated based on [[ionic mobility]], a quantity which tells how fast an [[ion]] migrates through an [[electric field]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn conventional ITP separations, a discontinuous buffer system is used. The sample is introduced between a zone of fast leading [[electrolyte]] (LE) and a zone of slow terminating (or: trailing) electrolyte (TE). Usually, the LE and the TE have a common [[counterion]], but the co-ions (having charges with the same sign as the analytes of interest) are different: the LE is defined by co-ions with high [[Electrical mobility|ionic mobility]], while the TE is defined by co-ions with low ionic mobility. The analytes of interest have intermediate ionic mobility. Application of an electric potential results in a low [[Electric field|electrical field]] in the leading electrolyte and a high electrical field in the terminating electrolyte. Analyte ions situated in the TE zone will migrate faster than the surrounding TE co-ions, while analyte ions situated in the LE will migrate slower; the result is that analytes are focused at the LE/TE interface.\n\nITP is a displacement method: focusing ions of a certain kind displace other ions. If present in sufficient amounts, focusing analyte ions can displace all electrolyte co-ions, reaching a plateau [[concentration]]. Multiple analytes with sufficiently different ionic mobilities will form multiple plateau zones. Indeed, plateau mode ITP separations are readily recognized by stairlike profiles, each plateau of the stair representing an electrolyte or analyte zone having (from LE to TE) increasing electric fields and decreasing conductivities. In peak mode ITP, analytes amounts are insufficient to reach plateau concentrations, such analytes will focus in sharp [[normal distribution|Gaussian]]-like peaks. In peak mode ITP, analyte peaks will strongly overlap, unless so-called spacer compounds are added with intermediate ionic mobilities between those of the analytes; such spacer compounds are able to segregate adjacent analyte zones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationaldiagnostics.com/electrophoresis/article/isotachophoresis|title=Isotachophoresis {{!}} National Diagnostics|website=www.nationaldiagnostics.com|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nA completed ITP separation is characterized by a [[dynamic equilibrium]] in which all coionic zones migrate with equal velocities. From this phenomenon ITP has obtained its name: iso = equal, ''tachos'' = speed, ''phoresis'' = migration.\n\nIsotachophoresis is exactly equal to the steady-state-stacking step in [[Discontinuous Electrophoresis|Discontinuous electrophoresis]].<ref>(1959\u20131964) see Ornstein*</ref>\n\n==Transient ITP==\nA popular form of ITP is transient ITP (tITP). It alleviates the limitation of conventional ITP that it has limited separation capacity because of analyte zone overlap.

Below the corresponding electrical field for each zone]]\n'''Isotachophoresis''' ('''ITP''') is a technique in [[analytical chemistry]] used for selective separation and concentration of ionic [[analyte]]s. It is a form of [[electrophoresis]]: charged analytes are separated based on [[ionic mobility]], a quantity which tells how fast an [[ion]] migrates through an [[electric field]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn conventional ITP separations, a discontinuous buffer system is used. The sample is introduced between a zone of fast leading [[electrolyte]] (LE) and a zone of slow terminating (or: trailing) electrolyte (TE). Usually, the LE and the TE have a common [[counterion]], but the co-ions (having charges with the same sign as the analytes of interest) are different: the LE is defined by co-ions with high [[Electrical mobility|ionic mobility]], while the TE is defined by co-ions with low ionic mobility. The analytes of interest have intermediate ionic mobility. Application of an electric potential results in a low [[Electric field|electrical field]] in the leading electrolyte and a high electrical field in the terminating electrolyte. Analyte ions situated in the TE zone will migrate faster than the surrounding TE co-ions, while analyte ions situated in the LE will migrate slower; the result is that analytes are focused at the LE/TE interface.\n\nITP is a displacement method: focusing ions of a certain kind displace other ions. If present in sufficient amounts, focusing analyte ions can displace all electrolyte co-ions, reaching a plateau [[concentration]]. Multiple analytes with sufficiently different ionic mobilities will form multiple plateau zones. Indeed, plateau mode ITP separations are readily recognized by stairlike profiles, each plateau of the stair representing an electrolyte or analyte zone having (from LE to TE) increasing electric fields and decreasing conductivities. In peak mode ITP, analytes amounts are insufficient to reach plateau concentrations, such analytes will focus in sharp [[normal distribution|Gaussian]]-like peaks. In peak mode ITP, analyte peaks will strongly overlap, unless so-called spacer compounds are added with intermediate ionic mobilities between those of the analytes; such spacer compounds are able to segregate adjacent analyte zones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationaldiagnostics.com/electrophoresis/article/isotachophoresis|title=Isotachophoresis {{!}} National Diagnostics|website=www.nationaldiagnostics.com|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nA completed ITP separation is characterized by a [[dynamic equilibrium]] in which all coionic zones migrate with equal velocities. From this phenomenon ITP has obtained its name: iso = equal, ''tachos'' = speed, ''phoresis'' = migration.\n\nIsotachophoresis is exactly equal to the steady-state-stacking step in [[Discontinuous Electrophoresis|Discontinuous electrophoresis]].<ref>(1959\u20131964) see Ornstein*</ref>\n\n==Transient ITP==\nA popular form of ITP is transient ITP (tITP). It alleviates the limitation of conventional ITP that it has limited separation capacity because of analyte zone overlap. In transient ITP, analytes are first concentrated by ITP, and then can be baseline separated by [[capillary zone electrophoresis|zone electrophoresis]]. Transient ITP is usually accomplished by dissolving the sample in the TE and sandwiching the sample/TE plug between LE zones - or vice versa: a sample/LE plug can also be sandwiched between TE zones.

In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[land transport|land]] ([[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport|road]]), [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s and [[business operations|operations]]. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of [[civilization]]s.\n\nTransport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway stations]], [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s) and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.\n\nVehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobiles]], [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[watercraft]], [[spacecraft]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]].\n\nOperations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.\n\nPassenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and [[globalization]], but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make [[traffic flow]] and restrain [[urban sprawl]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of transport}}\n[[File:Bronocice drawn.png|thumb|[[Bronocice pot]] with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world, found in [[Poland]]]]\n[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]\nHumans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of [[vehicle]]s. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe first forms of [[road transport]] involved animals, such as [[horse]]s ([[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), [[ox]]en (from about 8000 BCE)<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Watts\n| first1 = Martin\n| author-link1 =\n| title = Working Oxen\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u86yjr-J-hAC\n| series = Shire Album\n| volume = 342\n| location = Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire\n| publisher = Osprey Publishing\n| publication-date = 1999\n| page = 4\n| isbn = 9780747804154\n| access-date = 2016-02-08\n| quote = [...] tamed aurochs became the first domestic oxen.

Many early civilizations, including those in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], constructed paved roads.  In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.\n\n===Mechanical===\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in [[rail transport]], made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], which sped up global transport.\n\nWith the development of the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first \"modern\" highways were constructed during the 19th century{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} with [[macadam]]. Later, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] demonstrated the first successful controllable [[airplane]], and after World War I (1914\u20131918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158</ref>\n\nAfter World War II (1939\u20131945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.<ref name=cooper277>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277</ref> Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled.

Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance.

Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the [[nationalization]] of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of [[Amtrak]]. Recently,{{when|date=February 2016}} however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some{{quantify|date=February 2016}} ground and adherents.<ref>\nClifford Winston, ''Last Exit: Privatization and Deregulation of the U.S. Transportation System'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 2010).\n</ref>\n\n{{further|Timeline of transportation technology}}\n\n==Modes==\n{{Main|Mode of transport}}\nA mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.\n\n===Human-powered===\n{{Main|Human-powered transport}}\n[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]\nHuman-powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transport]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.\n\nAlthough humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].\n\n===Animal-powered===\n{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}\nAnimal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.\n\n===Air===\n{{Main|Aviation}}\n[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]].|alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine]]\nA [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft.\n\nTwo things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.\n\nThe aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, [[helicopter]]s can be used.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281</ref> As of April 28, 2009, ''The Guardian'' article notes that \"the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Land===\n{{Main|Land transport}}\nLand transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.\n\n====Rail====\n{{Main|Rail transport}}\n[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[Intercity Express]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train|alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside]]\n[[File:Monday morning rush at Xi'erqi Station, southbound (20170904084423).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Beijing Subway]] is one of the world's largest and busiest rapid transit networks.]]\nRail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].\n\nA train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.\n\n[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 279</ref> modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. [[Freight trains]] traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, [[container train]]s have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.\n\n====Road====\n{{Main|Road transport}}\n[[File:Harborfreeway2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Harbor Freeway]] is often heavily congested at rush hour in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].]]\nA road is an identifiable [[route number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].<ref Name=\"Major_Roads_of_the_United_States\">{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |date=2006-03-13 |url=http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413153426/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |archivedate=13 April 2007 |df= }}</ref> Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;<ref Name=\"RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica\">{{cite web|title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url=http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063243/http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].<ref>Lay, 1992: 6\u20137</ref> In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.<ref name=\"difference_between_road_and_street\">{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.\nRoad transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.\n\nAutomobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities;<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/05/one-in-five-europeans-exposed-to-harmful-noise-pollution-study|title=One in five Europeans exposed to harmful noise pollution \u2013 study|date=2020-03-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-05|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278</ref> Road transport by truck is often the initial and [[Last mile|final stage]] of freight transport.\n\n===Water===\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\n[[File:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|Automobile ferry in [[Croatia]]|alt=White ferry with ramps in the up-position, moored at jetty]]\nWater transport is movement by means of a [[watercraft]]\u2014such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]]\u2014over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.\n\nIn the 19th century, the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced in a [[boiler]] using wood or [[coal]] and fed through a steam [[external combustion engine]]. Now most ships have an [[internal combustion engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engines]] to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See [[Marine propulsion]].)\n\nAlthough it is slow compared to other transport, modern [[sea transport]] is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. [[Commercial vessel]]s, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.<ref>The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) 2007, p.

In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped]]\n[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].\n\n[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[Wire rope|cables]] instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.\n\n[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.\n\n[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant \"other place\" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.\n\n==Elements==\n\n===Infrastructure===\n{{Main|Infrastructure}}\n[[File:GoldenGateBridge BakerBeach MC.jpg|thumb|Bridges, such as [[Golden Gate Bridge]], allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water.]]\nInfrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] and [[sea lane|seaway]] do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.\n\nTerminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275\u201376</ref> For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.\n\nThe [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as [[landing fees]] at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.<ref>Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and S\u00f8ren L. Buhl, \"How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects\", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'' '''71''':2, pp. 131\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Vehicles===\n{{Main|Vehicle}}\n[[File:1992 Fiat Uno IE 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|A [[Fiat Uno]] in 2018]]\nA vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].\n\nVehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea|alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to \"arms\" that extend from the central building]]\nPrivate transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]].

However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.\n\n===Passenger===\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Passenger transport\"; if the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}\n[[File:ACTION Bus-467.jpg|thumb|A local transit bus operated by [[ACTION]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]|alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi-story building.]]\nPassenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], leisure or [[human migration|migration]].\n\nShort-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and [[rapid transit]] in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]].\n\nTaxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[demand-responsive transport]], offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.\n\n[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.\n\n===Medical===\n[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|An ambulance from World War I]]An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,<ref>[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, \"The Origin of Medical Terms\".

While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54</ref> [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4</ref> [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473</ref>\n\n[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]]]\n[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[International trade|international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering a huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.<ref name=bcn21114 />\n\n[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, [[cereals]] and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.\n\n[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328</ref> In addition to mail, common items sent by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.\n\n==Impact==\n{{Main|Sustainable transport}}\n\n===Economic===\n{{Main|Transport economics}}\n[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.|alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area.]]\n\nTransport is a key necessity for [[Departmentalization|specialization]]\u2014allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.  Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 2</ref> But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.\n\nDue to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.\n\n===Planning===\n{{Main|Transport planning}}\n\nTransport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is also studied through [[transport economics]], a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handled through [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]].\n\n[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving.|alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey]]\nBecause of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.\n\nToo much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many\u2014if not all\u2014of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on\u2014spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology and economics\u2014the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Environment===\n[[File:Traffic jam Sao Paulo 09 2006 30.JPG|thumb|[[Traffic congestion]] persists in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil, despite the no-drive days based on license numbers.|alt=Looking down a busy road, which is banked on both sides by tall buildings, some of which are covered in advertisement billboards]]\n{{Main|Environmental impact of transport}}\n\nTransport is a major use of [[energy (society)|energy]] and burns most of the world's [[petroleum]].

In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[land transport|land]] ([[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport|road]]), [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s and [[business operations|operations]]. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of [[civilization]]s.\n\nTransport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway stations]], [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s) and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.\n\nVehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobiles]], [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[watercraft]], [[spacecraft]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]].\n\nOperations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.\n\nPassenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and [[globalization]], but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make [[traffic flow]] and restrain [[urban sprawl]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of transport}}\n[[File:Bronocice drawn.png|thumb|[[Bronocice pot]] with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world, found in [[Poland]]]]\n[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]\nHumans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of [[vehicle]]s. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe first forms of [[road transport]] involved animals, such as [[horse]]s ([[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), [[ox]]en (from about 8000 BCE)<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Watts\n| first1 = Martin\n| author-link1 =\n| title = Working Oxen\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u86yjr-J-hAC\n| series = Shire Album\n| volume = 342\n| location = Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire\n| publisher = Osprey Publishing\n| publication-date = 1999\n| page = 4\n| isbn = 9780747804154\n| access-date = 2016-02-08\n| quote = [...] tamed aurochs became the first domestic oxen.

Many early civilizations, including those in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], constructed paved roads.  In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.\n\n===Mechanical===\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in [[rail transport]], made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], which sped up global transport.\n\nWith the development of the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first \"modern\" highways were constructed during the 19th century{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} with [[macadam]]. Later, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] demonstrated the first successful controllable [[airplane]], and after World War I (1914\u20131918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158</ref>\n\nAfter World War II (1939\u20131945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.<ref name=cooper277>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277</ref> Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled.

The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.\n\n===Human-powered===\n{{Main|Human-powered transport}}\n[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]\nHuman-powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transport]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.\n\nAlthough humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].\n\n===Animal-powered===\n{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}\nAnimal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.\n\n===Air===\n{{Main|Aviation}}\n[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]].|alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine]]\nA [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft.\n\nTwo things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.\n\nThe aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, [[helicopter]]s can be used.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281</ref> As of April 28, 2009, ''The Guardian'' article notes that \"the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Land===\n{{Main|Land transport}}\nLand transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.\n\n====Rail====\n{{Main|Rail transport}}\n[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[Intercity Express]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train|alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside]]\n[[File:Monday morning rush at Xi'erqi Station, southbound (20170904084423).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Beijing Subway]] is one of the world's largest and busiest rapid transit networks.]]\nRail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].\n\nA train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.\n\n[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 279</ref> modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. [[Freight trains]] traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, [[container train]]s have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.\n\n====Road====\n{{Main|Road transport}}\n[[File:Harborfreeway2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Harbor Freeway]] is often heavily congested at rush hour in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].]]\nA road is an identifiable [[route number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].<ref Name=\"Major_Roads_of_the_United_States\">{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |date=2006-03-13 |url=http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413153426/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |archivedate=13 April 2007 |df= }}</ref> Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;<ref Name=\"RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica\">{{cite web|title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url=http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063243/http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].<ref>Lay, 1992: 6\u20137</ref> In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.<ref name=\"difference_between_road_and_street\">{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.\nRoad transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.\n\nAutomobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities;<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/05/one-in-five-europeans-exposed-to-harmful-noise-pollution-study|title=One in five Europeans exposed to harmful noise pollution \u2013 study|date=2020-03-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-05|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278</ref> Road transport by truck is often the initial and [[Last mile|final stage]] of freight transport.\n\n===Water===\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\n[[File:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|Automobile ferry in [[Croatia]]|alt=White ferry with ramps in the up-position, moored at jetty]]\nWater transport is movement by means of a [[watercraft]]\u2014such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]]\u2014over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.\n\nIn the 19th century, the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced in a [[boiler]] using wood or [[coal]] and fed through a steam [[external combustion engine]]. Now most ships have an [[internal combustion engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engines]] to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See [[Marine propulsion]].)\n\nAlthough it is slow compared to other transport, modern [[sea transport]] is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. [[Commercial vessel]]s, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.<ref>The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.</ref> Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];<ref>Stopford, 1997: 4\u20136</ref> [[short sea shipping]] and [[ferry|ferries]] remain viable in coastal areas.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 8\u20139</ref><ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280</ref>\n\n===Other modes===\n[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] for [[crude oil]]|alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped]]\n[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].\n\n[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[Wire rope|cables]] instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.\n\n[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.\n\n[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant \"other place\" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.\n\n==Elements==\n\n===Infrastructure===\n{{Main|Infrastructure}}\n[[File:GoldenGateBridge BakerBeach MC.jpg|thumb|Bridges, such as [[Golden Gate Bridge]], allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water.]]\nInfrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] and [[sea lane|seaway]] do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.\n\nTerminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275\u201376</ref> For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.\n\nThe [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as [[landing fees]] at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.<ref>Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and S\u00f8ren L. Buhl, \"How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects\", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'' '''71''':2, pp. 131\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Vehicles===\n{{Main|Vehicle}}\n[[File:1992 Fiat Uno IE 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|A [[Fiat Uno]] in 2018]]\nA vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].\n\nVehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea|alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to \"arms\" that extend from the central building]]\nPrivate transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]]. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,<ref>Stopford, 1997: 422</ref> but ports can be public-owned.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 29</ref>\n\n===Policy===\nAs the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population\u2014according to the United Nations, 55% of the world\u2019s population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meredith |first=Sam |date=2018-05-17 |title=Two-thirds of global population will live in cities by 2050, UN says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/two-thirds-of-global-population-will-live-in-cities-by-2050-un-says.html |work=CNBC |access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The evolution of urban mobility: The interplay of academic and policy perspectives |last=Jones |first=Peter |date=July 2014 |journal=IATSS Research |volume=38 |pages=7\u201313 |doi=10.1016/j.iatssr.2014.06.001 }}</ref> The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.\n\n==Functions==\nRelocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.\n\n===Passenger===\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Passenger transport\"; if the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}\n[[File:ACTION Bus-467.jpg|thumb|A local transit bus operated by [[ACTION]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]|alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi-story building.]]\nPassenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], leisure or [[human migration|migration]].\n\nShort-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and [[rapid transit]] in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]].\n\nTaxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[demand-responsive transport]], offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.\n\n[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.\n\n===Medical===\n[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|An ambulance from World War I]]An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,<ref>[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, \"The Origin of Medical Terms\".

The word is often associated with road-going \"emergency ambulances\", which form part of [[emergency medical service]]s, administering [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] to those with acute medical problems.\n\n''Air medical services'' is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes.

While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54</ref> [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4</ref> [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473</ref>\n\n[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]]]\n[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[International trade|international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering a huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.<ref name=bcn21114 />\n\n[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, [[cereals]] and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.\n\n[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328</ref> In addition to mail, common items sent by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.\n\n==Impact==\n{{Main|Sustainable transport}}\n\n===Economic===\n{{Main|Transport economics}}\n[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.|alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area.]]\n\nTransport is a key necessity for [[Departmentalization|specialization]]\u2014allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.  Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 2</ref> But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.\n\nDue to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.\n\n===Planning===\n{{Main|Transport planning}}\n\nTransport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is also studied through [[transport economics]], a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handled through [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]].\n\n[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving.|alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey]]\nBecause of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use.

The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].<ref name=\"HSWCOOLANT\">{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reactivity control===\n{{main|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}\nThe rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.\n\nThe fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces\u2014often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.\n\nThe physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed \"[[prompt neutron]]s\") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in \"real time\"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.\n\nIn some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.\n\nIn other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\">{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nReactors used in [[nuclear marine propulsion]] (especially [[nuclear submarine]]s) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without [[Reactor refueling|refueling]].

The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.<ref>L. Szil\u00e1rd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB630726 \"Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,\"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).</ref> However, Szil\u00e1rd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szil\u00e1rd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.\n\nInspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a \"[[neutron howitzer]]\") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szil\u00e1rd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szil\u00e1rd had envisioned six years previously.\n\nOn 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szil\u00e1rd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szil\u00e1rd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.\n\nShortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure \"the Nazis don't blow us up.\" The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\nEventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942<ref>The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information</ref> at 3:25&nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.\n\nSoon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944.

They generally use [[uranium]] and its product [[plutonium]] as [[nuclear fuel]], though a [[thorium fuel cycle]] is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission [[chain reaction]]:\n* [[Thermal reactor|Thermal neutron reactor]]s (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or [[thermal neutron]]s to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain [[neutron moderator]] materials that slow neutrons until their [[neutron temperature]] is ''thermalized'', that is, until their [[kinetic energy]] approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].\n* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see [[fast breeder]] or [[Generation IV reactor#Fast reactors|generation IV reactors]]).\n\nIn principle, [[fusion power]] could be produced by [[nuclear fusion]] of elements such as the [[deuterium]] isotope of [[hydrogen]].  While an ongoing rich research topic since at least the 1940s, no self-sustaining fusion reactor for power generation has ever been built.\n\n====By moderator material====\nUsed by thermal reactors:\n* [[Graphite-moderated reactor]]s\n* Water moderated reactors\n**[[Heavy-water reactor]]s (Used in Canada,<ref name=\"hyperphysics\">{{cite web|last1=Nave|first1=R|title=Light Water Nuclear Reactors|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/ligwat.html |website=Hyperphysics |publisher = Georgia State University|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> India, Argentina, China, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Joyce|first=Malcolm|date=2018|title=Nuclear Engineering|journal=Elsevier|chapter=10.6|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/c2015-0-05557-5|isbn=9780081009628}}</ref>\n** [[Light-water reactor|Light-water-moderated reactors]] (LWRs).

That [[negative feedback]] stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra thermalization, these types can use [[natural uranium]]/unenriched fuel.\n* Light-element-moderated reactors.\n** [[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs) are moderated by light elements such as lithium or beryllium, which are constituents of the coolant/fuel matrix salts LiF and BeF<sub>2</sub>.\n** [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]]s, such as those whose coolant is a mixture of lead and bismuth, may use BeO as a moderator.\n* Organically moderated reactors (OMR) use [[biphenyl]] and [[terphenyl]] as moderator and coolant.\n\n====By coolant====\n[[File:RIAN archive 450312 Treatment of interior part of reactor frame.jpg|thumb|Treatment of the interior part of a [[VVER|VVER-1000]] reactor frame on [[Atommash]].]]\n[[File:Thermal reactor diagram.png|thumb|In thermal nuclear reactors (LWRs in specific), the coolant acts as a moderator that must slow down the neutrons before they can be efficiently absorbed by the fuel.]]\n* Water cooled reactor. These constitute the great majority of operational nuclear reactors: as of 2014, 93% of the world's nuclear reactors are water cooled, providing about 95% of the world's total nuclear generation capacity.<ref name=\"IAEA_reactors_stats\" />\n** [[Pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) Pressurized water reactors constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants.\n*** A primary characteristic of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized [[pressure vessel]]. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer \"bubble\" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.\n*** [[Pressurized heavy water reactor]]s are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using [[heavy water]] as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.\n** [[Boiling water reactor]] (BWR)\n*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses <sup>235</sup>U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\">{{cite web|last1=Lipper |first1=Ilan |first2=Jon |last2=Stone |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |title=Nuclear Energy and Society |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=3 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401172451/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.\n** [[Pool-type reactor]]\n* [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]].

Some reactors run hot enough that the gas can directly power a gas turbine.

The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (nonradioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They represent the majority (around 80%) of current reactors. This is a [[thermal neutron]] reactor design, the newest of which are the Russian [[VVER-1200]], Japanese [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor]], American [[AP1000]], Chinese [[Hualong One|Hualong Pressurized Reactor]] and the Franco-German [[European Pressurized Reactor]]. All the [[United States Naval reactor]]s are of this type.\n* [[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) [moderator: low-pressure water; coolant: low-pressure water]\n\n:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. The lower pressure of its cooling water allows it to boil inside the pressure vessel, producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]].\n[[File:CANDU at Qinshan.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]]]]\n* [[Pressurised heavy water reactor|Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR) [moderator: high-pressure heavy water; coolant: high-pressure heavy water]\n\n:: A Canadian design (known as [[CANDU]]), very similar to PWRs but using [[heavy water]]. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary water, it has greater [[neutron economy]] (creates a higher number of thermal neutrons), allowing the reactor to operate without [[Isotope separation|fuel enrichment facilities]]. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural [[uranium]] and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, [[Argentina]], China, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], and [[South Korea]]. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.\n:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] \u2014 a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]\n* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]]) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]\n\n:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2019, 10 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]\n[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] \u2014 an AGR]]\n* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]\n\n:: These designs an have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.\n* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]\n[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled \u2013 down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]\n\n:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to \"breed\" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:\n[[File:Superph\u00e9nix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superph\u00e9nix]], closed in 1998, was one of the few FBRs]]\n\n:::[[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]\n:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.\n::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]\n:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ]], [[BN-350]] and [[BN-600]] in USSR; [[Superph\u00e9nix]] in France; and [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] until May 2010. The [[EBR-I]], the first reactor to have a core meltdown, in 1955, was also a sodium-cooled reactor. \n* [[Pebble-bed reactor]]s (PBR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: helium]\n:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the [[AVR reactor|AVR]] and the [[HTR-10]] is operating in China, where the [[HTR-PM]] is being developed. The HTR-PM is expected to be the first generation IV reactor to enter operation.<ref name=\"WNN2018\">{{cite news|url=https://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurehtr-pm-making-dreams-come-true-7009889/|title=HTR-PM: Making dreams come true|last=|first=|date=|work=Nuclear Engineering International}}</ref>\n*[[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: molten salt mixture]\n::These dissolve the fuels in [[fluoride]] salts, or use fluoride salts for coolant.

The prototype was the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]], which also used the Thorium [[fuel cycle]]. As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|only 0.1% of transuranic waste]] compared to conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use. A separate issue is the radioactive fission products, which are not reprocessable and need to be disposed of as with conventional reactors.\n* [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]] (AHR) [moderator: high-pressure light or heavy water; coolant: high-pressure light or heavy water]\n\n:: These reactors use as fuel soluble nuclear salts (usually [[uranium sulfate]] or [[uranium nitrate]]) dissolved in water and mixed with the coolant and the moderator.

It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&nbsp;3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one by one as they age.

These designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation&nbsp;IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.<ref name=\"UIC1\">{{cite web |title=Generation IV Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf77.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Gas-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Molten salt reactor]]\n* [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Supercritical water reactor]]\n* [[Very-high-temperature reactor]]\n\n====Generation V+ reactors====\nGeneration V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present.

In theory, using UF<sub>6</sub> as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable [[neutron flux]], weakening most [[IFMIF|reactor materials]], and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the [[IFMIF|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]].\n** Gas core EM reactor.

A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the [[Carnot cycle]] and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40\u201345% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] to produce electricity.\n* [[Hybrid nuclear fusion]]. Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a [[breeder reactor|blanket]] of [[fertile material]], like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[thorium|Th-232]] and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] other reactor's [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.\n\n====Fusion reactors====\n{{Main|Fusion power}}\nControlled [[nuclear fusion]] could in principle be used in [[fusion power]] plants to produce power without the complexities of handling [[actinides]], but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.\n\n==Nuclear fuel cycle==\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}\nThermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].\n\nUnder 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.\nEnrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.\n\nMost BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).<ref>{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.\n\nMost reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, \"breeding\" fuel.\n\nIn [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n\n===Fueling of nuclear reactors===\nThe amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of \"full-power days,\" which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.\n\nAt the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is \"spent\", having spent 4 to 6 years in the reactor producing power.  This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Though considered \"spent,\" these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor.  Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers.  Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling.  Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles.  This means that 1 refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly 2 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.  This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\"/>  After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool.  The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately 5 years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years.  After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers.  On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel.  An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller that a football field.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nNot all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.\n\nThe amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.\n\n==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==\n{{Main|Nuclear safety}}\nNuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.<ref name=globen/> Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake,<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Gusterson, Hugh  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013    }}</ref> despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=Paton, James |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}</ref> Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.<ref name=globen>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> An interdisciplinary team from [[MIT]] has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005\u20132055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear accidents and controversy==\n{{See also|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}\n[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I]] overheated, causing the coolant water to [[Water splitting|dissociate]] and led to the hydrogen explosions.

Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.\n\nThe natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.\n\nThese natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n== Emissions ==\nNuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.\n\nAs an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T<sub>2</sub>O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder>{{cite report|date=February 2016|title=Backgrounder: Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0620/ML062020079.pdf|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic [[cosmic ray]]s at high altitudes.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder />\n\nThe amounts of [[strontium-90]] released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation.

The heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, (the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]]), releasing [[kinetic energy]], [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]], and [[free neutron]]s. A portion of these [[neutron]]s may be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on. This is known as a [[nuclear chain reaction]].\n\nTo control such a nuclear chain reaction, [[neutron poison]]s and [[neutron moderators]] can change the portion of neutrons that will go on to cause more fission.<ref name=\"DOE HAND\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf|title=DOE Fundamentals Handbook: Nuclear Physics and Reactor Theory|publisher=US Department of Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423194722/http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf|archivedate=23 April 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=24 September 2008}}\n</ref> Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to shut the fission reaction down if monitoring detects unsafe conditions.<ref>\n{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url=http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}\n</ref>\n\n===Heat generation===\nThe reactor core generates heat in a number of ways:\n* The [[kinetic energy]] of fission products is converted to [[thermal energy]] when these nuclei collide with nearby atoms.\n* The reactor absorbs some of the [[gamma rays]] produced during fission and converts their energy into heat.\n* Heat is produced by the [[radioactive decay]] of fission products and materials that have been activated by [[neutron absorption]].

The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].<ref name=\"HSWCOOLANT\">{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reactivity control===\n{{main|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}\nThe rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.\n\nThe fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces\u2014often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.\n\nThe physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed \"[[prompt neutron]]s\") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in \"real time\"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.\n\nIn some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.\n\nIn other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\">{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nReactors used in [[nuclear marine propulsion]] (especially [[nuclear submarine]]s) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without [[Reactor refueling|refueling]].

The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.<ref>L. Szil\u00e1rd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB630726 \"Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,\"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).</ref> However, Szil\u00e1rd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szil\u00e1rd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.\n\nInspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a \"[[neutron howitzer]]\") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szil\u00e1rd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szil\u00e1rd had envisioned six years previously.\n\nOn 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szil\u00e1rd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szil\u00e1rd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.\n\nShortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure \"the Nazis don't blow us up.\" The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\nEventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942<ref>The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information</ref> at 3:25&nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.\n\nSoon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944.

They generally use [[uranium]] and its product [[plutonium]] as [[nuclear fuel]], though a [[thorium fuel cycle]] is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission [[chain reaction]]:\n* [[Thermal reactor|Thermal neutron reactor]]s (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or [[thermal neutron]]s to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain [[neutron moderator]] materials that slow neutrons until their [[neutron temperature]] is ''thermalized'', that is, until their [[kinetic energy]] approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].\n* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer \"bubble\" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor.

The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (nonradioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They represent the majority (around 80%) of current reactors. This is a [[thermal neutron]] reactor design, the newest of which are the Russian [[VVER-1200]], Japanese [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor]], American [[AP1000]], Chinese [[Hualong One|Hualong Pressurized Reactor]] and the Franco-German [[European Pressurized Reactor]]. All the [[United States Naval reactor]]s are of this type.\n* [[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) [moderator: low-pressure water; coolant: low-pressure water]\n\n:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. The lower pressure of its cooling water allows it to boil inside the pressure vessel, producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]].\n[[File:CANDU at Qinshan.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]]]]\n* [[Pressurised heavy water reactor|Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR) [moderator: high-pressure heavy water; coolant: high-pressure heavy water]\n\n:: A Canadian design (known as [[CANDU]]), very similar to PWRs but using [[heavy water]]. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary water, it has greater [[neutron economy]] (creates a higher number of thermal neutrons), allowing the reactor to operate without [[Isotope separation|fuel enrichment facilities]]. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural [[uranium]] and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, [[Argentina]], China, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], and [[South Korea]]. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.\n:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] \u2014 a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]\n* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]]) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]\n\n:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2019, 10 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]\n[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] \u2014 an AGR]]\n* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]\n\n:: These designs an have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.\n* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]\n[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled \u2013 down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]\n\n:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to \"breed\" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:\n[[File:Superph\u00e9nix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superph\u00e9nix]], closed in 1998, was one of the few FBRs]]\n\n:::[[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]\n:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.\n::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]\n:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ]], [[BN-350]] and [[BN-600]] in USSR; [[Superph\u00e9nix]] in France; and [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] until May 2010. The [[EBR-I]], the first reactor to have a core meltdown, in 1955, was also a sodium-cooled reactor. \n* [[Pebble-bed reactor]]s (PBR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: helium]\n:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the [[AVR reactor|AVR]] and the [[HTR-10]] is operating in China, where the [[HTR-PM]] is being developed.

The prototype was the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]], which also used the Thorium [[fuel cycle]]. As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|only 0.1% of transuranic waste]] compared to conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use. A separate issue is the radioactive fission products, which are not reprocessable and need to be disposed of as with conventional reactors.\n* [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]] (AHR) [moderator: high-pressure light or heavy water; coolant: high-pressure light or heavy water]\n\n:: These reactors use as fuel soluble nuclear salts (usually [[uranium sulfate]] or [[uranium nitrate]]) dissolved in water and mixed with the coolant and the moderator.

It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&nbsp;3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one by one as they age. The design of the fuel makes fuel reprocessing expensive.\n* The [[Small, sealed, transportable, autonomous reactor]] (SSTAR) is being primarily researched and developed in the US, intended as a fast breeder reactor that is passively safe and could be remotely shut down in case the suspicion arises that it is being tampered with.\n* The [[Clean and Environmentally Safe Advanced Reactor]] (CAESAR) is a nuclear reactor concept that uses steam as a moderator \u2013 this design is still in development.\n* The [[Reduced moderation water reactor]] builds upon the [[Advanced boiling water reactor]](ABWR) that is presently in use, it is not a complete fast reactor instead using mostly [[epithermal neutron]]s, which are between thermal and fast neutrons in speed.\n* The [[hydrogen-moderated self-regulating nuclear power module]] (HPM) is a reactor design emanating from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] that uses [[uranium hydride]] as fuel.\n* [[Subcritical reactor]]s are designed to be safer and more stable, but pose a number of engineering and economic difficulties.

These designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation&nbsp;IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.<ref name=\"UIC1\">{{cite web |title=Generation IV Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf77.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Gas-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Molten salt reactor]]\n* [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Supercritical water reactor]]\n* [[Very-high-temperature reactor]]\n\n====Generation V+ reactors====\nGeneration V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present.

In theory, using UF<sub>6</sub> as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable [[neutron flux]], weakening most [[IFMIF|reactor materials]], and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the [[IFMIF|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]].\n** Gas core EM reactor.

A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the [[Carnot cycle]] and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40\u201345% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors.

Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.\n\n==Nuclear fuel cycle==\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}\nThermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].\n\nUnder 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.\nEnrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.\n\nMost BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).<ref>{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.\n\nMost reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, \"breeding\" fuel.\n\nIn [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n\n===Fueling of nuclear reactors===\nThe amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of \"full-power days,\" which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.\n\nAt the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is \"spent\", having spent 4 to 6 years in the reactor producing power.  This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Though considered \"spent,\" these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor.  Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers.  Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling.  Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles.  This means that 1 refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly 2 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.  This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\"/>  After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool.  The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately 5 years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years.  After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers.  On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel.  An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller that a football field.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nNot all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.\n\nThe amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.\n\n==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==\n{{Main|Nuclear safety}}\nNuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences.

Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.\n\nThe natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.\n\nThese natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n== Emissions ==\nNuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.\n\nAs an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T<sub>2</sub>O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder>{{cite report|date=February 2016|title=Backgrounder: Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0620/ML062020079.pdf|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic [[cosmic ray]]s at high altitudes.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder />\n\nThe amounts of [[strontium-90]] released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation. Detectable strontium-90 in ground water and the general environment can be traced to weapons testing that occurred during the mid-20th century (accounting for 99% of the Strontium-90 in the environment) and the Chernobyl accident (accounting for the remaining 1%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Radionuclides in Groundwater|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/rn-groundwater.html|website=U.S. NRC|publisher=nrc.gov|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|The Atomic Age}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[List of nuclear reactors]]\n* [[List of small modular reactor designs]]\n* [[List of United States Naval reactors]]\n* [[Neutron transport]]\n* [[Nuclear marine propulsion]]\n* [[Nuclear power by country]]\n* [[One Less Nuclear Power Plant]]\n* [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]\n* [[Safety engineering]]\n* [[Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants]]\n* [[Small modular reactor]]\n* [[Thorium-based nuclear power]]\n* [[Traveling wave reactor|Traveling-wave reactor (TWR)]]\n* ''[[World Nuclear Industry Status Report]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nuclear reactors}}\n* [http://www.iaea.org/pris/ The Database on Nuclear Power Reactors \u2013 IAEA]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110427113431/http://www.nmt.edu/nmt-news/336-2011/4101-uranium-conference-adds-session-reviewing-implications-of-japan-accident Uranium Conference adds discussion of Japan accident]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040929083915/https://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F09%2F24%2F1359225 A Debate: Is Nuclear Power The Solution to Global Warming?]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050826111231/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/nuclear_safety/page.cfm?pageID=1408 Union of Concerned Scientists, Concerns re: US nuclear reactor program]\n* [http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/67 Freeview Video 'Nuclear Power Plants \u2014 What's the Problem' A Royal Institution Lecture by John Collier by the Vega Science Trust.]\n* [http://www.nei.org/howitworks/electricpowergeneration/ Nuclear Energy Institute \u2014 How it Works: Electric Power Generation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061010034414/http://alsos.wlu.edu/qsearch.aspx?browse=science%2FNuclear+Reactors Annotated bibliography of nuclear reactor technology from the Alsos Digital Library]\n**{{in lang|ja}} [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zui6mGN5fT0C34rMCQMtG0ygCAu1MEWF/view \u30bd\u30f4\u30a3\u30a8\u30c8\u9023\u90a6\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5b87\u5b99\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u7089\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u7528]\n\n{{Nuclear technology}}\n{{Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents}}\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Energy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nuclear Reactor Technology}}\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n[[Category:Nuclear technology]]\n[[Category:Power station technology]]\n[[Category:Nuclear reactors| ]]\n[[Category:Pressure vessels]]\n[[Category:Nuclear research reactors|Nuclear research reactors]]\n[[Category:Nuclear power reactor types|Nuclear power reactor types]]\n[[Category:Neutron sources]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:4428:6b00:cc1b:1c56:a6:3db7", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Ye ma)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor"}
