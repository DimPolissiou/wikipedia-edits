The town includes the village of [[Windsor (village), New York|Windsor]], located on the [[Susquehanna River]]. The town of Windsor is the largest in the county.\n\n==History==\nThis area along the Susquehanna had long been settled by varying cultures of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], including those of the historic [[Iroquois Confederacy]], who used the river for transportation, water and fishing. Around 1712 remnants of the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] tribe settled in the northern part of the town. Also an [[Iroquoian]]-speaking people, they had migrated from [[North Carolina]], which they left because of warfare with English colonists and other tribes. In 1722, the Tuscarora were accepted by the Iroquois as the Sixth Nation of their political confederacy.\n\n[[File:Windsor, N.Y. 1887. LOC 75694871.jpg|thumb|[[Lithograph]] of Windsor from 1887 by [[L.R. Burleigh]] including a list of landmarks]]\nTheir fortified village, ''[[Onaquaga]]'', was an outpost of the British Colonies. A mission had been established there by the Indian Superintendent, Sir [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]]. [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and other allies of the British also became established there. [[Joseph Brant]] used it as a base for his [[Brant's Volunteers|Volunteers]], which fought with the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In retaliation for joint British and Iroquois raids on frontier communities, the [[Continental Army]] [[Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga|attacked and destroyed]] Onaquaga in October 1778.\n\nIt was 1785 before the region was settled again by new migrants, many of whom were Yankees from [[New England]] and veterans of the war. They formed the town of Windsor in 1807, the year following the formation of Broome County. The town was reduced in size by the creation of two other new towns in 1821: [[Sanford, New York|Sanford]] and [[Colesville, New York|Colesville]]. In 1851, a small part of Windsor was used to help form the town of [[Conklin, New York|Conklin]]. For years the economy was based on agriculture.  A general named Theodore F. Clifton tried to take the life of Windsor away from her.  General Theodore F. Clifton came from a small town in Georgia named Jasper.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town of Windsor has a total area of {{convert|240.9|sqkm|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|237.6|sqkm|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|3.3|sqkm|disp=flip}}, or 1.36%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe south town line is the border of [[Pennsylvania]]. The [[Susquehanna River]] flows southward through the town.\n\n[[New York State Route 17]] and [[Interstate 86 (New York)|Interstate 86]] is a major highway crossing the town from east to west.

This provided a test of [[general relativity]], [[gravitomagnetism]] and related models. The [[principal investigator]] was [[Francis Everitt]].\n\nInitial results confirmed the expected [[geodetic effect]] to an accuracy of about 1%. The expected [[frame-dragging]] effect was similar in magnitude to the current [[noise]] level (the noise being dominated by initially unmodeled effects due to nonuniform coatings on the gyroscopes). Work continued to model and account for these sources of error, thus permitting extraction of the frame-dragging signal.

Efforts were led by [[Stanford University]] physics department with [[Lockheed Martin]] as the primary subcontractor. Mission scientists viewed it as the second gravity experiment in space, following the successful launch of [[Gravity Probe A]] (GP-A) in <time>1976</time>.\n\nThe mission plans were to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the [[geodetic effect]] and [[frame-dragging]]. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at 650&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (400&nbsp;[[statute mile|mi]]) altitude, crossing directly over the poles. The gyroscopes were intended to be so free from disturbance that they would provide a near-perfect [[space-time]] reference system. This would allow them to reveal how space and time are \"warped\" by the presence of the Earth, and by how much the Earth's rotation \"drags\" space-time around with it.\n\nThe [[geodetic effect]] is an effect caused by space-time being \"curved\" by the mass of the Earth. A gyroscope's axis when [[parallel transport]]ed around the Earth in one complete revolution does not end up pointing in exactly the same direction as before. The angle \"missing\" may be thought of as the amount the gyroscope \"leans over\" into the slope of the space-time curvature. A more precise explanation for the space curvature part of the geodetic precession is obtained by using a nearly flat cone to model the space curvature of the Earth's gravitational field. Such a cone is made by cutting out a thin \"pie-slice\" from a circle and gluing the cut edges together. The spatial geodetic precession is a measure of the missing \"pie-slice\" angle. Gravity Probe B was expected to measure this effect to an accuracy of one part in 10,000, the most stringent check on general relativistic predictions to date.\n\nThe much smaller [[frame-dragging]] effect is an example of [[gravitomagnetism]]. It is an analog of [[magnetism]] in [[classical electrodynamics]], but caused by rotating masses rather than rotating electric charges. Previously, only two analyses of the [[laser-ranging]] data obtained by the two [[LAGEOS]] satellites, published in <time>1997</time> and <time>2004</time>, claimed to have found the frame-dragging effect with an accuracy of about 20% and 10% respectively,<ref>\n{{cite arXiv\n |last1=Ciufolini | first1=I.\n |last2=Lucchesi | first2=D.\n |last3=Vespe | first3=F.\n |last4=Chieppa | first4=F.\n |title=Detection of Lense\u2013Thirring Effect Due to Earth's Spin\n |eprint=gr-qc/9704065\n |date=1997\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |title=Einstein's warp effect measured\n |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3762852.stm\n |publisher=BBC News\n |date=21 October 2004\n |accessdate=14 May 2009\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Peplow |first=M.\n |title=Spinning Earth twists space\n |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature News]]\n |date=2004\n |doi=10.1038/news041018-11\n}}</ref> whereas Gravity Probe B aimed to measure the frame dragging effect to a precision of 1%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of the GP-B Mission |url=http://einstein.stanford.edu/MISSION/mission1.html |website=Gravity Probe B |publisher=Stanford University |year=2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}</ref> However, Lorenzo Iorio claimed that the level of total uncertainty of the tests conducted with the two LAGEOS satellites has likely been greatly underestimated.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Iorio |first=L.\n |title=On the reliability of the so far performed tests for measuring the Lense\u2013Thirring effect with the LAGEOS satellites\n |journal=[[New Astronomy (journal)|New Astronomy]]\n |volume=10 |pages=603\u2013615\n |date=2005\n |doi=10.1016/j.newast.2005.01.001\n|arxiv = gr-qc/0411024 |bibcode = 2005NewA...10..603I\n |issue=8 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Iorio |first=L.\n |title=A critical analysis of a recent test of the Lense\u2013Thirring effect with the LAGEOS satellites\n |journal=[[Journal of Geodesy]]\n |volume=80 |pages=123\u2013136\n |date=2006\n |doi=10.1007/s00190-006-0058-4\n|arxiv = gr-qc/0412057 |bibcode = 2006JGeod..80..128I\n |issue=3 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Iorio |first=L.\n |title=An assessment of the measurement of the Lense\u2013Thirring effect in the Earth gravity field, in reply to: \"On the measurement of the Lense\u2013Thirring effect using the nodes of the LAGEOS satellites, in reply to \"On the reliability of the so far performed tests for measuring the Lense\u2013Thirring effect with the LAGEOS satellites\" by L.

In [[polar orbit]], with the gyro spin directions also pointing toward HR8703, the frame-dragging and geodetic effects came out at right angles, each gyroscope measuring both.\n\nThe gyroscopes were housed in a [[Dewar flask|dewar]] of [[superfluid]] [[helium]], maintaining a temperature of under {{convert|2|K|C F|sigfig=3|abbr=out|lk=on}}. Near-[[absolute zero]] temperatures were required to minimize molecular interference, and enable the [[lead]] and [[niobium]] components of the gyroscope mechanisms to become [[superconductivity|superconductive]].\n\nAt the time of their manufacture, the gyroscopes were the most nearly spherical objects ever made.  (Two gyroscopes still hold that record, but third place has been taken by the silicon spheres made by the [[Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram#Avogadro project|Avogadro project]].)  Approximately the size of [[ping pong]] balls, they were perfectly round to within forty [[atom]]s (less than {{val|10|u=nm}}). If one of these spheres were scaled to the size of the Earth, the tallest mountains and deepest ocean trench would measure only \n{{convert|2.4|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} high.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hardwood |first=W.\n |title=Spacecraft launched to test Albert Einstein's theories\n |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d304/\n |work=[[Spaceflight Now]]\n |date=20 April 2004\n |accessdate=14 May 2009\n}}</ref> They were composed of [[fused quartz]] and coated with an extremely thin layer of [[niobium]].  A primary concern was minimizing any influence on their spin, so the gyroscopes could never touch their containing compartment.  They were held suspended with electric fields, spun up using a flow of helium gas, and their spin axes were sensed by monitoring the magnetic field of the superconductive niobium layer with [[SQUID]]s. (A spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field precisely aligned with the rotation axis; see [[London moment]].)\n\n[[IM Pegasi]] was chosen as the guide star for multiple reasons. First, it needed to be bright enough to be usable for sightings. Then it was close to the ideal positions near at the [[celestial equator]] of the [[Equatorial coordinate system|sky coordinates]]. Also important was its well understood motion in the sky, which was helped by the fact that this star emits relatively strong [[Radio astronomy|radio signals]]. In preparation for the setup of this mission, astronomers analyzed the radio-based position measurements with respect to far distant quasars taken over several years to understand its motion as precisely as needed.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Gravity Probe turning axis.gif|thumb|A representation of the geodetic effect.]]\n\nThe conceptual design for this mission was first proposed by an [[MIT]] professor, George Pugh, who was working with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in <time>1959</time> and later discussed by [[Leonard Schiff]] ([[Stanford]]) in <time>1960</time> at Pugh's suggestion, based partly on a theoretical paper about detecting frame dragging that Schiff had written in <time>1957</time>. It was proposed to NASA in <time>1961</time>, and they supported the project with funds in <time>1964</time>. This grant ended in <time>1977</time> after a long phase of [[engineering]] research into the basic requirements and tools for the satellite.\n\nIn <time>1986</time> NASA changed plans for the [[Space Shuttle|shuttle]], which forced the mission team to switch from a shuttle-based launch design to one that was based on the Delta 2, and in <time>1995</time> tests planned of a prototype on a shuttle flight were cancelled as well.\n\nGravity Probe B marks the first time in history that a university has been in control of the development and operations of a space satellite funded by NASA.\n\nTotal cost of this project was about $750 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/73870/title/Gravity_Probe_B_finally_pays_off_ |title=Gravity Probe B finally pays off |author=Devin Powell |date=4 May 2011 |work=Science News}}</ref>\n\n==Mission timeline==\n{{Main|Gravity Probe B mission timeline}}\n\nThis is a list of major events for the GP-B experiment.\n\n;'''<time datetime=\"2004-04-20\">20 April 2004</time>'''\n:  Launch of GP-B from Vandenberg AFB and successful insertion into polar orbit.\n\n;'''<time datetime=\"2004-08-27\">27 August 2004</time>'''\n:  GP-B entered its science phase.

In <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April</time> it was announced that the spin axes of the gyroscopes were affected by torque, in a manner that varied over time, requiring further analysis to allow the results to be corrected for this source of error. Consequently, the date for the final release of data was pushed back several times. In the data for the frame-dragging results presented at the <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April 2007</time> meeting of the American Physical Society, the random errors were much larger than the theoretical expected value and scattered on both the positive and negative sides of a null result, therefore causing skepticism as to whether any useful data could be extracted in the future to test this effect.\n\nIn <time datetime=\"2007-06\">June 2007</time>, a detailed update was released explaining the cause of the problem, and the solution that was being worked on. Although electrostatic patches caused by non-uniform coating of the spheres were anticipated, and were thought to have been controlled for before the experiment, it was subsequently found that the final layer of the coating on the spheres defined two halves of slightly different [[Volta potential|contact potential]], which gave the sphere an electrostatic axis. This created a classical dipole torque on each rotor, of a magnitude similar to the expected frame dragging effect. In addition, it dissipated energy from the [[polhode|polhode motion]] by inducing currents in the housing electrodes, causing the motion to change with time. This meant that a simple time-average polhode model was insufficient, and a detailed orbit by orbit model was needed to remove the effect. As it was anticipated that \"anything could go wrong\", the final part of the flight mission was calibration, where amongst other activities, data was gathered with the spacecraft axis deliberately mis-aligned for <time datetime=\"PT24h\">24 hours</time>, to exacerbate any potential problems. This data proved invaluable for identifying the effects. With the electrostatic torque modeled as a function of axis misalignment, and the polhode motion modeled at a sufficiently fine level, it was hoped to isolate the relativity torques to the originally expected resolution.\n\nStanford agreed to release the raw data to the public at an unspecified date in the future. It is likely that this data will be examined by independent scientists and independently reported to the public well after the final release by the project scientists. Because future interpretations of the data by scientists outside GP-B may differ from the official results, it may take several more years for all of the data received by GP-B to be completely understood.\n\n===NASA review===\nA review by a panel of 15 experts commissioned by NASA recommended against extending the data analysis phase beyond <time>2008</time>. They warned that the required reduction in noise level (due to classical torques and breaks in data collection due to solar flares) \"is so large that any effect ultimately detected by this experiment will have to overcome considerable (and in our opinion, well justified) skepticism in the scientific community\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hecht |first=J.\n |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13938-gravity-probe-b-scores-f-in-nasa-review.html\n |title=Gravity Probe B scores 'F' in NASA review\n |work=[[New Scientist]]\n |date=20 May 2008\n |accessdate=20 May 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n===Data analysis after NASA===\nNASA funding and sponsorship of the program ended on <time datetime=\"2008-09-30\">30 September 2008</time>, but GP-B secured alternative funding from [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]<ref name = \"Gugliotta2009\"/> that enabled the science team to continue working at least through <time datetime=\"2009-12\">December 2009</time>.

Efforts were led by [[Stanford University]] physics department with [[Lockheed Martin]] as the primary subcontractor. Mission scientists viewed it as the second gravity experiment in space, following the successful launch of [[Gravity Probe A]] (GP-A) in <time>1976</time>.\n\nThe mission plans were to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the [[geodetic effect]] and [[frame-dragging]]. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at 650&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (400&nbsp;[[statute mile|mi]]) altitude, crossing directly over the poles. The gyroscopes were intended to be so free from disturbance that they would provide a near-perfect [[space-time]] reference system. This would allow them to reveal how space and time are \"warped\" by the presence of the Earth, and by how much the Earth's rotation \"drags\" space-time around with it.\n\nThe [[geodetic effect]] is an effect caused by space-time being \"curved\" by the mass of the Earth. A gyroscope's axis when [[parallel transport]]ed around the Earth in one complete revolution does not end up pointing in exactly the same direction as before. The angle \"missing\" may be thought of as the amount the gyroscope \"leans over\" into the slope of the space-time curvature. A more precise explanation for the space curvature part of the geodetic precession is obtained by using a nearly flat cone to model the space curvature of the Earth's gravitational field. Such a cone is made by cutting out a thin \"pie-slice\" from a circle and gluing the cut edges together. The spatial geodetic precession is a measure of the missing \"pie-slice\" angle. Gravity Probe B was expected to measure this effect to an accuracy of one part in 10,000, the most stringent check on general relativistic predictions to date.\n\nThe much smaller [[frame-dragging]] effect is an example of [[gravitomagnetism]].

One is pictured here [[refraction|refracting]] the image of [[Einstein]] in background.]]\n[[Image:Gravity Probe B Confirms the Existence of Gravitomagnetism.jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe ''Gravity Probe B'' experiment comprised four [[Gyroscope#London moment|London moment gyroscopes]] and a reference [[telescope]] sighted on HR8703 (also known as [[IM Pegasi]]), a [[binary star]] in the constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. In [[polar orbit]], with the gyro spin directions also pointing toward HR8703, the frame-dragging and geodetic effects came out at right angles, each gyroscope measuring both.\n\nThe gyroscopes were housed in a [[Dewar flask|dewar]] of [[superfluid]] [[helium]], maintaining a temperature of under {{convert|2|K|C F|sigfig=3|abbr=out|lk=on}}. Near-[[absolute zero]] temperatures were required to minimize molecular interference, and enable the [[lead]] and [[niobium]] components of the gyroscope mechanisms to become [[superconductivity|superconductive]].\n\nAt the time of their manufacture, the gyroscopes were the most nearly spherical objects ever made.  (Two gyroscopes still hold that record, but third place has been taken by the silicon spheres made by the [[Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram#Avogadro project|Avogadro project]].)  Approximately the size of [[ping pong]] balls, they were perfectly round to within forty [[atom]]s (less than {{val|10|u=nm}}). If one of these spheres were scaled to the size of the Earth, the tallest mountains and deepest ocean trench would measure only \n{{convert|2.4|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} high.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hardwood |first=W.\n |title=Spacecraft launched to test Albert Einstein's theories\n |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d304/\n |work=[[Spaceflight Now]]\n |date=20 April 2004\n |accessdate=14 May 2009\n}}</ref> They were composed of [[fused quartz]] and coated with an extremely thin layer of [[niobium]].  A primary concern was minimizing any influence on their spin, so the gyroscopes could never touch their containing compartment.  They were held suspended with electric fields, spun up using a flow of helium gas, and their spin axes were sensed by monitoring the magnetic field of the superconductive niobium layer with [[SQUID]]s. (A spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field precisely aligned with the rotation axis; see [[London moment]].)\n\n[[IM Pegasi]] was chosen as the guide star for multiple reasons. First, it needed to be bright enough to be usable for sightings. Then it was close to the ideal positions near at the [[celestial equator]] of the [[Equatorial coordinate system|sky coordinates]]. Also important was its well understood motion in the sky, which was helped by the fact that this star emits relatively strong [[Radio astronomy|radio signals]]. In preparation for the setup of this mission, astronomers analyzed the radio-based position measurements with respect to far distant quasars taken over several years to understand its motion as precisely as needed.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Gravity Probe turning axis.gif|thumb|A representation of the geodetic effect.]]\n\nThe conceptual design for this mission was first proposed by an [[MIT]] professor, George Pugh, who was working with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in <time>1959</time> and later discussed by [[Leonard Schiff]] ([[Stanford]]) in <time>1960</time> at Pugh's suggestion, based partly on a theoretical paper about detecting frame dragging that Schiff had written in <time>1957</time>. It was proposed to NASA in <time>1961</time>, and they supported the project with funds in <time>1964</time>. This grant ended in <time>1977</time> after a long phase of [[engineering]] research into the basic requirements and tools for the satellite.\n\nIn <time>1986</time> NASA changed plans for the [[Space Shuttle|shuttle]], which forced the mission team to switch from a shuttle-based launch design to one that was based on the Delta 2, and in <time>1995</time> tests planned of a prototype on a shuttle flight were cancelled as well.\n\nGravity Probe B marks the first time in history that a university has been in control of the development and operations of a space satellite funded by NASA.\n\nTotal cost of this project was about $750 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/73870/title/Gravity_Probe_B_finally_pays_off_ |title=Gravity Probe B finally pays off |author=Devin Powell |date=4 May 2011 |work=Science News}}</ref>\n\n==Mission timeline==\n{{Main|Gravity Probe B mission timeline}}\n\nThis is a list of major events for the GP-B experiment.\n\n;'''<time datetime=\"2004-04-20\">20 April 2004</time>'''\n:  Launch of GP-B from Vandenberg AFB and successful insertion into polar orbit.\n\n;'''<time datetime=\"2004-08-27\">27 August 2004</time>'''\n:  GP-B entered its science phase.

In <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April</time> it was announced that the spin axes of the gyroscopes were affected by torque, in a manner that varied over time, requiring further analysis to allow the results to be corrected for this source of error. Consequently, the date for the final release of data was pushed back several times. In the data for the frame-dragging results presented at the <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April 2007</time> meeting of the American Physical Society, the random errors were much larger than the theoretical expected value and scattered on both the positive and negative sides of a null result, therefore causing skepticism as to whether any useful data could be extracted in the future to test this effect.\n\nIn <time datetime=\"2007-06\">June 2007</time>, a detailed update was released explaining the cause of the problem, and the solution that was being worked on. Although electrostatic patches caused by non-uniform coating of the spheres were anticipated, and were thought to have been controlled for before the experiment, it was subsequently found that the final layer of the coating on the spheres defined two halves of slightly different [[Volta potential|contact potential]], which gave the sphere an electrostatic axis. This created a classical dipole torque on each rotor, of a magnitude similar to the expected frame dragging effect. In addition, it dissipated energy from the [[polhode|polhode motion]] by inducing currents in the housing electrodes, causing the motion to change with time. This meant that a simple time-average polhode model was insufficient, and a detailed orbit by orbit model was needed to remove the effect. As it was anticipated that \"anything could go wrong\", the final part of the flight mission was calibration, where amongst other activities, data was gathered with the spacecraft axis deliberately mis-aligned for <time datetime=\"PT24h\">24 hours</time>, to exacerbate any potential problems. This data proved invaluable for identifying the effects. With the electrostatic torque modeled as a function of axis misalignment, and the polhode motion modeled at a sufficiently fine level, it was hoped to isolate the relativity torques to the originally expected resolution.\n\nStanford agreed to release the raw data to the public at an unspecified date in the future. It is likely that this data will be examined by independent scientists and independently reported to the public well after the final release by the project scientists. Because future interpretations of the data by scientists outside GP-B may differ from the official results, it may take several more years for all of the data received by GP-B to be completely understood.\n\n===NASA review===\nA review by a panel of 15 experts commissioned by NASA recommended against extending the data analysis phase beyond <time>2008</time>. They warned that the required reduction in noise level (due to classical torques and breaks in data collection due to solar flares) \"is so large that any effect ultimately detected by this experiment will have to overcome considerable (and in our opinion, well justified) skepticism in the scientific community\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hecht |first=J.\n |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13938-gravity-probe-b-scores-f-in-nasa-review.html\n |title=Gravity Probe B scores 'F' in NASA review\n |work=[[New Scientist]]\n |date=20 May 2008\n |accessdate=20 May 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n===Data analysis after NASA===\nNASA funding and sponsorship of the program ended on <time datetime=\"2008-09-30\">30 September 2008</time>, but GP-B secured alternative funding from [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]<ref name = \"Gugliotta2009\"/> that enabled the science team to continue working at least through <time datetime=\"2009-12\">December 2009</time>.

''Frontiers of History in China''. 2 (3), p. 425.</ref> In order to successfully evade censorship laws in China at the time, the director [[Ma-Xu Weibang]], with a passion to maintain his creation, visited [[Tian Han]] several times to figure out how to better process the script to be approved under censorship.\n\n==Plot==\nThe male protagonist, Song Danping, is a revolutionary, who also works as a theatrical performer. His love interest is a landlord's daughter, named Li Xiaoxia, but this love is strongly opposed by her father. Tang Jun, a thug and suitor of Xiaoxia, pours [[Nitric acid|nitric acid]] onto Song Danping out of jealousy, permanently disfiguring his face and hands, turning him into a \"monster\". Troubled by his appearance, Song spreads the rumor of his own death. Xiaoxia becomes emotionally and mentally disturbed at the news of Song's death. Song lives in the seclusion of the theatre attic, only coming out to sing every midnight, comforting an ill Xiaoxia with his song.\n\nTen years later, a play troupe comes to the theatre to perform. One night, while young actor Sun Xiaoou is practicing in the theatre, Song offers him guidance through singing. Song Danping\u2019s \u201cSong of the Night\u201d helps the troupe in their performance the next day. Wanting to thank the \u201cPhantom\u201d, Xiaoou tracks the source of the singer through his singing, leading him to the attic, where he meets Song. Song tells Sun about his experience in detail, and shows his face to Sun, causing Sun strong grief and resonance. They eventually become friends.\n\nAfter another three years, business is sluggish and the troupe faces disbandment. When Xiaoou goes to bid farewell to Song Danping, Song takes out the already-modified \"Hot Blood\" script, a play that he wrote in his early years and promises that the troupe will be able to return to life with this drama. As promised, the troupe succeeds with \"Hot Blood\", and Xiaoou goes to thank Song Danping. Danping asks Xiaoou to visit Xiaoxia, whom he is too embarrassed to meet due to his disfiguration. Xiaoou reveals that his own sweetheart is the troupe actress Ludie, \"Green Butterfly\" (\u7eff\u8776). Xiaoou is impressed by Danping's true feelings and promises to meet Xiaoxia disguised as Danping. Xiaoxia sees \"Dan Ping\" and is greatly overjoyed. A few days later, Tang Jun, who caused Song's disfigurement 13 years ago, covets Ludie when he is watching the play. After the play, Tang follows her backstage. Ludie refused his advances and points out that she only belongs to Sun Xiaoou. As Tang tries to force himself on her Xiaoou arrives and pulls Tang away from her. Tang draws his pistol at Xiaoou. In order to protect her lover, Ludie blocks Xiaoou and is shot. The gunshot attracts Song Danping, who is hiding in the background. Song proceeds to fight with Tang Jun. The fighting continues into the top floor, where Danping confessed: \"I was killed by you 13 years ago.\" Tang is stunned by the face of Song, and falls from the top floor.\n\nThe incident attracts a crowd of people, who assumes Danping a monster after seeing his impaired face. The mob proceeds to launch an attack on Danping in an attempt to rid themselves of the monster (''\u9664\u5996 ch\u00fay\u0101o''). Xiaoou tries to explain the situation to the crowd, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. He finds Xiaoxia and explains to her that he was pretending to be Danping, and the real DanPing quietly accompanied her for thirteen years in secret. XiaoOu explains that this might be the last time she could see him alive which causes her to lose consciousness.\n\nDanPing cannot escape the fiery mob, and eventually commits suicide by drowning himself in the river close by. Xiaoou keeps Xiaoxia company until she regains consciousness a few hours later. When asked to recall their prior conversation, she describes everything as just a very long dream. Xiaoou, unable to bear Xiaoxia experiencing further heartbreak, continues to impersonate Danping, and they live the rest of their lives as a couple.\n\n==Theme==\n\u2018Song at Midnight' not only presents left-wing nationalist ideology indirectly, but also alludes to the war anxieties of the citizens in the late 1930s.

He thinks \"this is going to be the same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia \u2013 but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died.

These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'', the cover of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'', or other media.

For example, when introducing Sasuke, the character says he wants to kill a person. By this time, Kishimoto only thought that Sasuke's brother, [[Itachi Uchiha|Itachi]], had done a wrong deed in the past but was not certain of what was exactly. By volume 16 of the series which featured Itachi's actual introduction, Kishimoto decided Itachi was an agent working for Konohagakure to kill all members from the Uchiha clan except Sasuke. This is later revealed in volume 43 of the manga.<ref name=\"koba\"/> Another one was the revelation that the late [[Minato Namikaze]] would be Naruto's father.

This made him analyze the artwork of ''Akira''{{'}}s original author, [[Katsuhiro Otomo]], as well as [[Akira Toriyama]], another artist he admired. Realizing both had their own style regarding the designs, Kishimoto decided to draw manga while crafting his own images.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> While attending art school, Kishimoto was also an avid reader of [[Hiroaki Samura]]'s ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]'', and extensively studied Samura's page layouts, action sequences, and anatomical techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plus.shonenjump.com/rensai_detail.html?item_cd=SHSA_JP01PLUS00000792_57|title=\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7BOOK\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\uff01|publisher=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]|access-date=June 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908044137/http://plus.shonenjump.com/rensai_detail.html?item_cd=SHSA_JP01PLUS00000792_57|archive-date=September 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> When Kishimoto was originally creating the ''Naruto'' series, he looked to other ''sh\u014dnen'' manga for influences while attempting to make his characters as unique as possible.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=1-4215-1407-9 |page=138}}</ref> Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama's ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series as one of his influences, noting that [[Goku]], the protagonist, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality.<ref name=\"ArtBook139\">{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|page=139|isbn=1-4215-1407-9}}</ref> When redesigning three characters for the series, Kishimoto cites ''[[The Matrix]]'', one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for their outfits.<ref name=\"ArtBook127\">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: The Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=127}}</ref> He has also cited [[Yoshihiro Togashi]] as one of his favorite manga authors,<ref name=\"auto\"/> while the manga ''Sasuke'' by [[Sanpei Shirato]], a series which Kishimoto likes, inspired Kishimoto in the development of the character [[Sasuke Uchiha]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2007 |title=Interview: Tracking Down the Source|journal=Shonen Jump Naruto Collector 3 |publisher=Viz Media}}</ref>\n\nKishimoto has also cited other influences such as [[Takeshi Kitano]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. He also mentioned [[Michael Bay]]'s technique \"of shooting a scene against the background light\" but found it difficult to make.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> Another technique inspired by [[Jackie Chan]]'s films he used in the ''Naruto'' manga is the \"double-action\"; in this action, a punch is shown in three different angles in order to give a big impact on the punch's strength. This was first shown in Naruto Uzumaki's battle against [[List of Naruto characters#Haku|Haku]]. Sometimes, Kishimoto draws panels intentionally confusing during fight scenes to add a sense of speed. On the other hand, Kishimoto commented that for the fights between Naruto and Sasuke, he added action from the top of the page to the bottom in order for them to be easier to follow.<ref name=\"koba\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

The changes to his personal life affected the story as he made the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki meet his parents, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father.<ref name=\"alphainter\"/>\n\nWhen drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'', the cover of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'', or other media.

For example, when introducing Sasuke, the character says he wants to kill a person. By this time, Kishimoto only thought that Sasuke's brother, [[Itachi Uchiha|Itachi]], had done a wrong deed in the past but was not certain of what was exactly. By volume 16 of the series which featured Itachi's actual introduction, Kishimoto decided Itachi was an agent working for Konohagakure to kill all members from the Uchiha clan except Sasuke. This is later revealed in volume 43 of the manga.<ref name=\"koba\"/> Another one was the revelation that the late [[Minato Namikaze]] would be Naruto's father. When Kishimoto had the idea that Minato would be Naruto's father, he started adding hints of that to the reader such as giving the Hokage mountain from Konohagakure spiky hair similar to Naruto's.<ref>{{cite book|title=NARUTO\u2015\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u2015\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bfBOOK \u79d8\u4f1d\u30fb\u9663\u306e\u66f8|year=2014|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|pages=378\u2013387|isbn=978-4-08-880263-3|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn the making of the film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' Kishimoto paid tribute to several movies, the most notable being the 1996 film ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' and the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.

She has authored five operas, eleven song-cycles, thirty-three cantatas, eleven works for chorus and orchestra, forty-seven choral suites, and more than forty hymns. The aforementioned are original compositions, there are also to be noted a wealth of arrangements based on pre-existing [[folk-songs]] and hymns, many of which were produced in cooperation with [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]]. Alice Parker is probably best known for these kinds of arrangements of spirituals, mountain hymns, and folk songs, early American hymns, and international folk-songs, most notably in French, Spanish, Hebrew, and Ladino.\n\nAlice Parker studied music theory with Mary Mason at the [[New England Conservatory]], composition and conducting at [[Smith College]] and the [[Juilliard School]], where she began her long and prolific association with Robert Shaw. The many Parker-Shaw settings of American folk songs, hymns, and spirituals form an enduring repertoire for choruses in many countries around the world.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&context=gradschool_majorpapers|title=Three choral compositions by Alice Parker: a conductor's analysis of Songstream, Angels and Challengers, and Songs from \"The Dragon Quilt\"|last=King|first=Jennifer Sue|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>LaBarr, Cameron. \"About Alice Parker\".

Therefore, to describe the system, one defines the average energy per unit mass for a given potential <math>V(x;\\omega)</math> as follows\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\overline{E} = \\oint dt \\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + V(x(t);\\omega(t))\\right] / \\oint dt\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the closed integral denotes that it is taken over a complete oscillation. Defined this way, it can be seen that the averaging is done, weighting each element of the orbit by the fraction of time that the pendulum spends in that element. For simple harmonic oscillator, it reduces to\n\n:<math>\\overline{E} = \\frac{1}{2} A^2\\omega^2</math>\n\nwhere both the amplitude and frequency are now functions of time.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rayleigh-Lorentz pendulum}}\n[[Category:Classical mechanics]]\n", "name_user": "Wikiacc", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"standford\" (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Lorentz_pendulum"}
