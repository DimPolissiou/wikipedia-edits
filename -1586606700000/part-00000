The Newtown forwards, with Ryan and Townsend very prominent, began to trouble their opponents and after a succession of snappy attacks, Bain kicked for the comer, and Collins made a good try. Brown's kick dropped short Eastern Suburbs 7 points, Newtown 6.

Newtown 9, Eastern Suburbs 7. A few minutes later Messenger made scores equal with a neat penalty goal - 9 points each. Again the Newtown pack rushed play to their opponents' zone, and Bain again using the cross-kick cleverly, paved the way for Collins to score his second try P. A.

A versatile {{rlp|lk}} for the [[St George Dragons]], [[Illawarra Steelers]], [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and the merged [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]], he also represented [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] and [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]].\n\n==Playing career==\nA St George junior from the Brighton Seagulls club, Mackay was graded by the Dragons in 1987 and then played 117 games with club over eight seasons till 1994 scoring 22 tries. Playing all positions in the backline bar halfback, he was most remembered for his lock position in his peak.\n\nMackay debuted for the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales Blues]] as a reserve in game II of the  [[1989 State of Origin series]]. He went on to play 17 [[Rugby League State of Origin|Origin]] games between 1989 and 1995, scoring three tries at that level.\n\nMackay had his best season in [[1990 NSWRL season|1990]], making his test d\u00e9but for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in the mid-season test against [[France national rugby league team|France]], becoming only the second player to score a hat trick of tries on d\u00e9but for Australia. A month after the France test, Mackay went on to play in a one off test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. Following the season he was selected for the [[1990 Kangaroo Tour]], coming into the test team for the winning 2nd and 3rd [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes Tests]] against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] before playing in the two tests against France.\n\nAfter failing to hold his test place in 1991, Mackay was selected for the first two tests against Great Britain during the Lions [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia|1992 tour of Australasia]] but missed the last match of the series through injury. After playing in a [[1989-1992 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup qualifying]] match against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] in [[Townsville]], Mackay was used as a replacement in the Dragons 8-28 [[1992 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]] loss to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and missed a place in Australia's World Cup Final winning team.\n\n1993 saw Mackay continue his good form and he was the starting lock forward for NSW in all three [[1993 State of Origin series|State of Origin]] games in the Blues 2-1 series win over [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]]. The return from injury of [[Bradley Clyde]] would see Mackay on the bench for Australia in the 1st and 3rd Trans-Tasman Tests against New Zealand.\n\nLater that year he became one of only four players (the others being Bradley Clyde in [[1991 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1991]], [[Daly Cherry-Evans]] in [[2013 NRL Grand Final|2013]] and [[Jack Wighton]] in [[2019 NRL Grand Final|2019]]) to win the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] from the losing side when the Dragons went down 6-14 in the [[1993 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]], again to the Brisbane Broncos.\n\nSt. George's form dropped markedly in 1994 and Mackay could only make the Bench for NSW in their [[1994 State of Origin series]] win over [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]], with NSW coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] preferring Bradley Clyde at lock. He made his final test appearance for Australia from the interchange bench in the [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|1994 mid-season test]] against France at [[Parramatta Stadium]], but the Dragons poor form, which saw them fall to 11th on the [[1994 NSWRL season#Ladder|premiership ladder]], saw Mackay overlooked for the [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] bringing down the curtain on his international career.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org</ref>\n\nMackay decided to leave the Dragons due to a poor relationship with coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]], later saying, \"Brian had signed an extension on his contract and so I felt like I needed a change or I'd go down the drain as a player.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author = Adam Burnett|title = Legend Q&A|journal = [[Rugby League Week]]|issue =13 October 2010|\npages = pgs 38\u201339|publisher = PBLMedia|location = Sydney, NSW}}</ref>\n\nMackay joined the [[Western Reds]] in [[Australian Rugby League season 1995|1995]], accepting the foundation captaincy of the [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]-based side, but moved back east when they joined the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] franchise from 1996.\n\nHe started playing for the [[Illawarra Steelers]] in [[Australian Rugby League season 1996|1996]], staying for three seasons over which he played 56 games. A return to his best form and season-long consistency in 1997 earned him the BHP Medal as the Steelers' player of the year. Mackay later became part of the new Dragons when the joint venture was formed in 1999, playing 24 games, including an appearance from the bench in the [[1999 NRL Grand Final]] loss to the [[Melbourne Storm]].<ref>Alan Whiticker. Encyclopedia Of Rugby League Players. 2005 edition</ref>\n\nMackay had played a total of 248 first grade games over 12 years.\n\nMackay played out his career in the 2000 season with the [[Bradford Bulls]] in the UK, winning the [[Challenge Cup]] Final with them.\n\n==Post playing==\nBrad Mackay is a committed Christian.

A sole penalty goal to Maroons hooker [[Wayne Bartrim]] after 30&nbsp;minutes was enough to see Vautin's unfancied Queensland team home 2\u20130. Referee Eddie Ward penalised Blues front rower [[Paul Harragon]] for a tackle on [[Gary Larson (rugby league)|Gary Larson]] and Bartrim kicked the goal from 25&nbsp;metres out. At the time it seemed a minor event but by game's end the goal had become pivotal.\n\nNew South Wales failed to capitalise on their chances, crossing the Queensland line twice. First winger [[Rod Wishart]] stepped into touch after taking a cross-field kick from [[Andrew Johns]]. Then in the second half, Blues centre [[Terry Hill]] was held up by Queensland debutante winger [[Matt Sing]] over the line with 17&nbsp;minutes to play. It was the lowest ever score in a representative game in Australia, yet still a compelling spectacle as the underdog Maroons repelled the New South Wales attack time and time again.\n\nFrom this match came a moment for the annals of Origin tradition when broadcast sound and vision captured the indelible image of Maroons lock [[Billy Moore (rugby league)|Billy Moore]] exiting the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] tunnel after half-time chanting the Maroon's war cry \"Queenslander\" over and over to exhort his team-mates.\n\n==Game II==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox\n|bg = #eeeeee\n|date =Wednesday, 31 May 1995\n|report = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game44.html (Report)]\n|team1 = [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]]\n|team2 = [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]]\n|score = 20\u201312\n|points1 = ('''8''' - 4 g) [[Wayne Bartrim]] <br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Brett Dallas]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Adrian Lam]]\n|points2 = [[Brett Rodwell]] ('''4''' - 1 t) <br>  [[Jim Serdaris]] ('''4''' - 1 t) <br> [[Rod Wishart]] ('''4''' - 2 g)\n|stadium = [[MCG]], [[Melbourne]]\n|attendance = 52,994\n|referee= Eddie Ward\n|manofmatch= [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] }}\n\nGoing into the second game, Qld suffered a blow when Dale Shearer, their most experienced player (having played 25 games since making his Origin debut in [[1985 State of Origin series|1985]]) and only [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] test representative, was ruled out with injury. His place in the side was taken by [[1994 Kangaroo tour]]ist [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]]. Smith, who had initially signed with Super League earlier in the year, had turned his back on the rebels and had only recently re-signed with the ARL. Playing at {{rlp|FE}} rather than his usual position of {{rlp|LK}}, Smith won the Man of the Match award.\n\nRumours of an all-in brawl that had circulated before Game II at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] were realised early when the first scrum erupted into violence after NSW {{rlp|HK}} [[Jim Serdaris]] started throwing punches at his opposite Wayne Bartrim. Almost like it was rehearsed, most players from both sides became involved and it took referee Eddie Ward a considerable time to restore order (in the confusion, Ward also failed to stop the game clock and almost 5 minutes elapsed before time was called off). During the brawl there were two main groups. Rival back rowers [[David Barnhill]] and Billy Moore waged their own private war throwing a lot of punches that missed their mark before wrestling each other to the ground, while Origin's old cry of \"Mate against mate\" added another chapter when [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] teammates [[John Hopoate]] (NSW) and [[Danny Moore]] (Qld) squared off after Moore came to [[Matt Sing]]'s aid.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsd0hbSIZkM Classic 1995 Origin Brawl - EVERYONE VS EVERYONE melee]</ref> Another outbreak late in the half saw props [[Paul Harragon]] and [[Gavin Allen]] marched to the sin bin.\n\nQueensland had the run of play and again shocked their highly fancied rivals by racing to an 8\u20130 lead on the back of a [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]] try and two goals from Wayne Bartrim. Blues captain [[Brad Fittler]] worked hard to lift his troops but again he found his team out enthused by Paul Vautin's patched-together but spirited combination.\n\nWith five minutes remaining, Jim Serdaris scored a converted try to close the gap to 14-12 and the Blues began a final wave of attack. [[Steve Menzies]] then came within inches of scoring the match winner but was held up, and then Fittler threw what appeared to be the match winning pass to a try-bound [[Tim Brasher]]. However referee Ward ruled the pass forward to destroy the Blues' hopes and as they dropped their guard, flying Queensland winger [[Brett Dallas]] caught them out in the dying seconds and ran 90 metres from dummy-half, easily out pacing Hopoate, Brasher and [[Rod Wishart]] coming across in cover, to score under the posts and seal the series with a 20\u201312 victory to give Qld what many believe to be the biggest boilover in Origin history.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XplXzuWUCkQ State of Origin 1995 Game 2 Bret Dallas Try @ 80 mins]</ref>\n\n==Game III==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox\n|bg = #eeeeee\n|date =Monday, 12 June 1995\n|report = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game45.html (Report)]\n|team1 = [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]]\n|team2 = [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]]\n|score = 24\u201316\n|points1 = ('''8''' - 4 g) [[Wayne Bartrim]] <br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Brett Dallas]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Ben Ikin]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Billy Moore (rugby league)|Billy Moore]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]]\n|points2 = [[Rod Wishart]] ('''8''' - 1 t, 2 g) <br>  [[Tim Brasher]] ('''4''' - 1 t) <br> [[Adam Muir]] ('''4''' - 1 t)\n|stadium = [[Lang Park]], [[Brisbane]]\n|attendance = 40,189\n|referee= David Manson\n|manofmatch= [[Adrian Lam]] }}\n\nExperts were still favouring a New South Wales win in game III, but again they were proved wrong in a match that lived up to Origin expectations. The chances of popular Maroons' captain [[Trevor Gillmeister]] playing in the final game had looked impossible - he had been admitted to hospital with an infected knee and placed on an intravenous drip. In an inspiring gesture that underlined the ferocity of feeling in the side signed himself out to take his place in the team.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Menzies\n| first = Steve\n| authorlink = Steve Menzies\n|author2= Tasker, Norman\n| title = Beaver: The Steve Menzies Story\n| publisher = Allen & Unwin\n| year = 2008\n| location = Australia\n| page = 132\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MC0_bNv8XNYC&source=gbs_navlinks_s\n| doi =\n| id =\n| isbn = 9781741755602}}\n</ref>\n\nThe two combatants punched and counter-punched before a late try to the previously unheralded [[Gold Coast Seagulls|Gold Coast]] rookie [[Ben Ikin]] gave the Maroons a 24\u201316 win and a 3\u20130 series whitewash. New South Wales led twice at 10-6 after 35&nbsp;minutes and again 16-12 after 41&nbsp;minutes, but the Queensland spirit was resolute. The series was career defining for Ikin, a Gold Coast junior who became the youngest player in Origin history at 18 years and 83 days when he debuted in Game I. He would later become a mainstay of Queensland and Broncos' sides up until 2003 although his career was disrupted by injury.\n\nMany considered Queensland lucky to play the last 52 minutes of the match with a full team after prop forward [[Tony Hearn (rugby league)|Tony Hearn]] appeared to headbutt NSW prop [[Mark Carroll (rugby league)|Mark Carroll]] in the 28th minute. In retaliation Carroll started throwing punches at Hearn which led to another all in brawl. Remarkably, referee David Manson only put Hearn on report and then penalised Carroll for the use of a forearm while tackling Hearn and awarded a penalty to Qld.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHIPaZnWduA Hearn vs Carroll - Game 3, 1995]</ref> Hearn was later suspended for 8 games by the ARL judiciary as a result of his headbutt. After his performances for Qld in the first two games, the front row forward from [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] had allegedly been in line for an Australian test jumper before his suspension.\n\nAfter the game, Gillmeister returned to hospital to continue treatment on his knee.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Steve Ricketts |author2=Barry Dick |author3=Paul Malone |title=The 30 greatest controversies in 30 years of State of Origin series|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/the-30-greatest-controversies-in-30-years-of-state-of-origin-series/story-e6frf9if-1226364330596|accessdate=26 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=23 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==New South Wales teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Position\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Game 1\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Game 2\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Game 3\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|\n\n|-\n!

Then in the second half, Blues centre [[Terry Hill]] was held up by Queensland debutante winger [[Matt Sing]] over the line with 17&nbsp;minutes to play. It was the lowest ever score in a representative game in Australia, yet still a compelling spectacle as the underdog Maroons repelled the New South Wales attack time and time again.\n\nFrom this match came a moment for the annals of Origin tradition when broadcast sound and vision captured the indelible image of Maroons lock [[Billy Moore (rugby league)|Billy Moore]] exiting the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] tunnel after half-time chanting the Maroon's war cry \"Queenslander\" over and over to exhort his team-mates.\n\n==Game II==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox\n|bg = #eeeeee\n|date =Wednesday, 31 May 1995\n|report = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game44.html (Report)]\n|team1 = [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]]\n|team2 = [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]]\n|score = 20\u201312\n|points1 = ('''8''' - 4 g) [[Wayne Bartrim]] <br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Brett Dallas]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Adrian Lam]]\n|points2 = [[Brett Rodwell]] ('''4''' - 1 t) <br>  [[Jim Serdaris]] ('''4''' - 1 t) <br> [[Rod Wishart]] ('''4''' - 2 g)\n|stadium = [[MCG]], [[Melbourne]]\n|attendance = 52,994\n|referee= Eddie Ward\n|manofmatch= [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] }}\n\nGoing into the second game, Qld suffered a blow when Dale Shearer, their most experienced player (having played 25 games since making his Origin debut in [[1985 State of Origin series|1985]]) and only [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] test representative, was ruled out with injury. His place in the side was taken by [[1994 Kangaroo tour]]ist [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]]. Smith, who had initially signed with Super League earlier in the year, had turned his back on the rebels and had only recently re-signed with the ARL. Playing at {{rlp|FE}} rather than his usual position of {{rlp|LK}}, Smith won the Man of the Match award.\n\nRumours of an all-in brawl that had circulated before Game II at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] were realised early when the first scrum erupted into violence after NSW {{rlp|HK}} [[Jim Serdaris]] started throwing punches at his opposite Wayne Bartrim. Almost like it was rehearsed, most players from both sides became involved and it took referee Eddie Ward a considerable time to restore order (in the confusion, Ward also failed to stop the game clock and almost 5 minutes elapsed before time was called off). During the brawl there were two main groups. Rival back rowers [[David Barnhill]] and Billy Moore waged their own private war throwing a lot of punches that missed their mark before wrestling each other to the ground, while Origin's old cry of \"Mate against mate\" added another chapter when [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] teammates [[John Hopoate]] (NSW) and [[Danny Moore]] (Qld) squared off after Moore came to [[Matt Sing]]'s aid.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsd0hbSIZkM Classic 1995 Origin Brawl - EVERYONE VS EVERYONE melee]</ref> Another outbreak late in the half saw props [[Paul Harragon]] and [[Gavin Allen]] marched to the sin bin.\n\nQueensland had the run of play and again shocked their highly fancied rivals by racing to an 8\u20130 lead on the back of a [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]] try and two goals from Wayne Bartrim. Blues captain [[Brad Fittler]] worked hard to lift his troops but again he found his team out enthused by Paul Vautin's patched-together but spirited combination.\n\nWith five minutes remaining, Jim Serdaris scored a converted try to close the gap to 14-12 and the Blues began a final wave of attack. [[Steve Menzies]] then came within inches of scoring the match winner but was held up, and then Fittler threw what appeared to be the match winning pass to a try-bound [[Tim Brasher]]. However referee Ward ruled the pass forward to destroy the Blues' hopes and as they dropped their guard, flying Queensland winger [[Brett Dallas]] caught them out in the dying seconds and ran 90 metres from dummy-half, easily out pacing Hopoate, Brasher and [[Rod Wishart]] coming across in cover, to score under the posts and seal the series with a 20\u201312 victory to give Qld what many believe to be the biggest boilover in Origin history.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XplXzuWUCkQ State of Origin 1995 Game 2 Bret Dallas Try @ 80 mins]</ref>\n\n==Game III==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox\n|bg = #eeeeee\n|date =Monday, 12 June 1995\n|report = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game45.html (Report)]\n|team1 = [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]]\n|team2 = [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]]\n|score = 24\u201316\n|points1 = ('''8''' - 4 g) [[Wayne Bartrim]] <br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Brett Dallas]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Ben Ikin]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Billy Moore (rugby league)|Billy Moore]]<br> ('''4''' - 1 t) [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]]\n|points2 = [[Rod Wishart]] ('''8''' - 1 t, 2 g) <br>  [[Tim Brasher]] ('''4''' - 1 t) <br> [[Adam Muir]] ('''4''' - 1 t)\n|stadium = [[Lang Park]], [[Brisbane]]\n|attendance = 40,189\n|referee= David Manson\n|manofmatch= [[Adrian Lam]] }}\n\nExperts were still favouring a New South Wales win in game III, but again they were proved wrong in a match that lived up to Origin expectations. The chances of popular Maroons' captain [[Trevor Gillmeister]] playing in the final game had looked impossible - he had been admitted to hospital with an infected knee and placed on an intravenous drip. In an inspiring gesture that underlined the ferocity of feeling in the side signed himself out to take his place in the team.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Menzies\n| first = Steve\n| authorlink = Steve Menzies\n|author2= Tasker, Norman\n| title = Beaver: The Steve Menzies Story\n| publisher = Allen & Unwin\n| year = 2008\n| location = Australia\n| page = 132\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MC0_bNv8XNYC&source=gbs_navlinks_s\n| doi =\n| id =\n| isbn = 9781741755602}}\n</ref>\n\nThe two combatants punched and counter-punched before a late try to the previously unheralded [[Gold Coast Seagulls|Gold Coast]] rookie [[Ben Ikin]] gave the Maroons a 24\u201316 win and a 3\u20130 series whitewash. New South Wales led twice at 10-6 after 35&nbsp;minutes and again 16-12 after 41&nbsp;minutes, but the Queensland spirit was resolute. The series was career defining for Ikin, a Gold Coast junior who became the youngest player in Origin history at 18 years and 83 days when he debuted in Game I. He would later become a mainstay of Queensland and Broncos' sides up until 2003 although his career was disrupted by injury.\n\nMany considered Queensland lucky to play the last 52 minutes of the match with a full team after prop forward [[Tony Hearn (rugby league)|Tony Hearn]] appeared to headbutt NSW prop [[Mark Carroll (rugby league)|Mark Carroll]] in the 28th minute. In retaliation Carroll started throwing punches at Hearn which led to another all in brawl. Remarkably, referee David Manson only put Hearn on report and then penalised Carroll for the use of a forearm while tackling Hearn and awarded a penalty to Qld.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHIPaZnWduA Hearn vs Carroll - Game 3, 1995]</ref> Hearn was later suspended for 8 games by the ARL judiciary as a result of his headbutt. After his performances for Qld in the first two games, the front row forward from [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] had allegedly been in line for an Australian test jumper before his suspension.\n\nAfter the game, Gillmeister returned to hospital to continue treatment on his knee.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Steve Ricketts |author2=Barry Dick |author3=Paul Malone |title=The 30 greatest controversies in 30 years of State of Origin series|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/the-30-greatest-controversies-in-30-years-of-state-of-origin-series/story-e6frf9if-1226364330596|accessdate=26 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=23 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==New South Wales teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Position\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Game 1\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Game 2\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Game 3\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|\n\n|-\n!

This series saw the return to representative football of players who had signed with [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], after a court decision had delayed the beginning of Super League until at least 2000. As a result, both teams were back to full strength, and a new record was set for the highest State of Origin crowd at the Sydney Football Stadium.\n\n[[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] were able to bounce back from the 3 - 0 whitewash of the [[1995 Rugby League State of Origin series|1995 Series]] and win the 1996 series 3 - 0, reversing the result of the previous year.

His position of choice was on the {{rlp|wg}}, though he played {{rlp|ce}} later in his career.\n\n==Playing career==\n===1980s===\nMackay was a schoolboy [[rugby union]] representative with the Sydney Combined High Schools side. He was graded by [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] in 1987 and made his first grade d\u00e9but in round 1 of the 1988 season. He was a regular first-grader in 1989 and a capable goal-kicker booting 19 conversions and scoring six tries in his second top-grade season.\n\n===1990s===\nIndifferent form saw Mackay make only eleven appearances in Wests' run-on side in 1990 and at the end of that season he was swapped by Wests in the short-lived and controversial [[draft (sports)|draft system]] which existed in Australian rugby league solely in the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1991|1991 season]]. \nA strong runner and defender Mackay added the strength of an extra forward to the backline. He was a member of the Panthers successful [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1991|1991 premiership]] side. Following the grand final victory he travelled with the Panthers to England for the [[1991 World Club Challenge]] which was lost to Wigan.\nMackay was 31st draft choice when snapped up by [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]]. Under Gould as State coach, Mackay made his representative d\u00e9but for [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] on the wing in game I of the [[1992 State of Origin series]]. He also played in game II of 1992. In 1992 he made his [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian national]] d\u00e9but in a Test match against Papua New Guinea in Townsville. Mackay scored two tries in a man-of-the-match performance on d\u00e9but. He was chosen in Australia's [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] squad at year's end, he did not play in the final.\n\nMackay regularly competed for a New South Wales wing spot against [[Andrew Ettingshausen]], gaining selection in State of Origin game III of 1993 and game I of 1994 (NSW selectors though always had the luxury of playing ET at either fullback, wing or centre).\n\nDespite his goal-kicking ability and strong bursts down the flank, his representative form was inconsistent and he was dropped after the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|Blues']] game I loss of 1994.\n\nMackay quit the Panthers at the end of 1994 to link with his former coach Gould at [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]]. He spent the 1995 season there and returned to good goal-kicking form booting 20 goals in just 13 games.\n\nIn 1996 he joined the [[South Queensland Crushers]] for that club's second season in the ARL. Following a pay dispute with the cash-strapped Crushers, he joined the neighbouring [[Gold Coast Chargers]], and captained the Chargers during the final two years of the club\u2019s existence.\nFollowing the demise of the Gold Coast, Mackay signed with his sixth club, the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] for the [[1999 NRL season]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000 he transferred to [[Super League]] club, [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. In the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]] tournament Mackay represented [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]].\n\nMackay switched to [[Bradford Bulls]] in 2001. He played for them at centre, scoring a [[Try (rugby)|try]], and kicking a goal in their [[2001 Super League Grand Final]] victory against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]].\n\nThe swansong of his long and varied first grade career was in 2002 with [[Hull F.C.]] In 2003 he joined the [[Ipswich Jets]] under coach [[Trevor Gillmeister]]. Mackay started coaching the Ormeau Shearers on the Gold Coast in 2012.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Andrews, Malcolm (2006) ''The ABC of Rugby League'' Austn Broadcasting Corpn, Sydney\n* ''Big League's 25 Years of Origin Collectors' Edition'', News Magazines, Surry Hills, Sydney\n* [[Alan Whiticker|Whiticker, Alan]] & Hudson, Glen (2006) ''The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players'', Gavin Allen Publishing, Sydney\n\n{{Scotland squad 2000 Rugby League World Cup}}\n{{Bradford Bulls -

Like the [[1995 State of Origin series]], players from clubs aligned with [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] were not eligible for selection. Gone were established players [[Laurie Daley]], [[Allan Langer]], [[Ricky Stuart]], [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Bradley Clyde]], [[Gorden Tallis]] and [[Kevin Walters]] - all representing their respective states in the newly invented [[Super League Tri-series]].\n\nFor the [[Australian Rugby League]] loyalists, younger talent in [[Andrew Johns]], [[Matt Sing]], [[Ben Ikin]], [[Adrian Lam]], [[Trent Barrett]], [[Steve Menzies]] and [[Robbie O'Davis]] all came of age in 1997. Fought out against the backdrop of public disillusion and a game bitterly divided due to the [[Super League war]], 1997's was a dour series. The spirit was there, and some new faces, but the intensity wasn't quite the same. The New South Wales camp was brightened with the arrival of one of Australian rugby league's traditional and colourful characters in [[Tommy Raudonikis]] as coach who guided New South Wales to their fifth series win in six years on the back of the strong legacy left by Raudonikis' predecessor coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]].\n\n==Game I==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox |\nbg = #eeeeee |\ndate = Wednesday, 28 May 1997 |\nteam1 = [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]] [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] |\nscore = 6\u20138 |\nreport = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game49.html (Report)] |\nteam2 = [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] |\npoints1 = [[Adrian Lam]]('''4''' - 1t)<br />[[Wayne Bartrim]] ('''2''' - 1g) |\npoints2 = ('''4''' - 1t) [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]]<br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Andrew Johns]]<br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Rod Wishart]] |\nstadium = [[Suncorp Stadium]], [[Brisbane]] |\nattendance = 28,222 |\nreferee= Kelvin Jeffes |\nmanofmatch= [[Geoff Toovey]] }}\n\n[[Tommy Raudonikis]]'  Blues gained the ascendency in game I - a match lacking the traditional early Origin intensity but which came alive in the second half as the prospect of a New South Wales triumph became reality. The Blues lead 8-0 at half-time after a try to [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]] in the 31st minute and a goal each to [[Rod Wishart]] and Andrew Johns.\n\nInjuries conspired against the visitors with McGregor, Wishart and Johns all forced from the field and sensing vulnerability the Maroons surged back. Queensland dominated the second-half but the Blues defence held out. Eventually weight of possession told and the Blues were cut to a 2-point lead when Maroons debutant [[Adrian Lam]] - a Papua New Guinean representative given dispensation to play Origin since 1995 - scored in the 68th minute.\n\nNew South Wales' brave and nuggety [[Hooker (rugby league)|hooker]] [[Geoff Toovey]] lifted for the occasion and in the last ten minutes made a series of probing darts which kept the Maroons on the back foot and which earned him man-of-the-match honours and victory for the Blues.\n\n==Game II==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox |\nbg = #eeeeee |\ndate = Wednesday, 11 June 1997 |\nteam1 = [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] |\nscore = 15\u201314 |\nreport = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game50.html (Report)] |\nteam2 = [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]] |\npoints1 = [[Ken McGuinness]] ('''4''' - 1t)<br /> [[Nik Kosef]] ('''4''' - 1t)<br />[[Jim Dymock]] ('''4''' - 1t) <br />  [[John Simon (rugby league)|John Simon]] ('''3''' - 1g, 1fg)|\npoints2 = ('''4''' - 1t) [[Matt Sing]] <br />('''4''' - 1t) [[Robbie O'Davis]] <br />('''4''' - 1t) [[Brett Dallas]]<br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Julian O'Neill]] |\nstadium = [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]], [[Melbourne]] |\nattendance = 25,105 |\nreferee= David Manson |\nmanofmatch= [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]] }}\n\nNew South Wales looked to have wrapped up Game II by racing to a 14-0 lead after just 27&nbsp;minutes via tries to [[Ken McGuinness]], [[Nik Kosef]] and [[Jim Dymock]].

Then from a scrum near half way, Carroll flattened replacement Maroons prop [[Craig Smith (rugby league, born 1971)|Craig Smith]] (who had only just come on for O'Brien), while Johns and Goddard continued their private war with Johns actually running around one of the touch judges to continue the fight, though the issue was soon put beyond doubt when Goddard landed a right hand that put the future [[The Immortals (rugby league)|rugby league Immortal]] on the deck and requiring stitches from a split lip.

Like the [[1995 State of Origin series]], players from clubs aligned with [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] were not eligible for selection. Gone were established players [[Laurie Daley]], [[Allan Langer]], [[Ricky Stuart]], [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Bradley Clyde]], [[Gorden Tallis]] and [[Kevin Walters]] - all representing their respective states in the newly invented [[Super League Tri-series]].\n\nFor the [[Australian Rugby League]] loyalists, younger talent in [[Andrew Johns]], [[Matt Sing]], [[Ben Ikin]], [[Adrian Lam]], [[Trent Barrett]], [[Steve Menzies]] and [[Robbie O'Davis]] all came of age in 1997. Fought out against the backdrop of public disillusion and a game bitterly divided due to the [[Super League war]], 1997's was a dour series. The spirit was there, and some new faces, but the intensity wasn't quite the same. The New South Wales camp was brightened with the arrival of one of Australian rugby league's traditional and colourful characters in [[Tommy Raudonikis]] as coach who guided New South Wales to their fifth series win in six years on the back of the strong legacy left by Raudonikis' predecessor coach [[Phil Gould]].\n\n==Game I==\n{{Rugbyleaguebox |\nbg = #eeeeee |\ndate = Wednesday, 28 May 1997 |\nteam1 = [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]] [[File:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] |\nscore = 6\u20138 |\nreport = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game49.html (Report)] |\nteam2 = [[File:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] |\npoints1 = [[Adrian Lam]]('''4''' - 1t)<br />[[Wayne Bartrim]] ('''2''' - 1g) |\npoints2 = ('''4''' - 1t) [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]]<br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Andrew Johns]]<br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Rod Wishart]] |\nstadium = [[Suncorp Stadium]], [[Brisbane]] |\nattendance = 28,222 |\nreferee= Kelvin Jeffes |\nmanofmatch= [[Geoff Toovey]] }}\n\n[[Tommy Raudonikis]]'  Blues gained the ascendency in game I - a match lacking the traditional early Origin intensity but which came alive in the second half as the prospect of a New South Wales triumph became reality.
