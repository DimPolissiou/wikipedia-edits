The AI may learn useful general rules from the test-set, such as \"reviews containing the word 'horrible'\" are likely to be negative\". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as \"reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive\"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be \"cheating\" or \"unfair\". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.<ref name=science/>\n\n== Goals ==\nCooperation between [[Agency (sociology)|agents]], in this case algorithms and humans, depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formalization of trust criteria is a barrier to straightforward optimization approaches.

Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning, especially those relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, explicitly relied on representations of explanations, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.\n\nIn the 1980s through early 1990s, truth maintenance systems (TMS) were developed to extend the capabilities of causal-reasoning, rule-based, and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360-362}} A TMS acts to explicitly track alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces.  As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:\n{{Quote\n|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: \"Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.

MYCIN, developed in the early 1970s as a research prototype for diagnosing [[bacteremia]] infections of the bloodstream, could explain <ref>{{cite book |last=Van Lent |first=M. |last2=Fisher |first2=W. |last3=Mancuso |first3=M. |date=July 2004 |chapter=An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior |title=Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence |pages=900\u2013907 |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=AAAI Press |isbn=0262511835}}</ref> which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case. Research in [[intelligent tutoring systems]] developed systems such as SOPHIE that could act as an 'articulate expert', explaining problem-solving strategy at a level the student could understand, so they would know what action to take next. For instance, SOPHIE could explain the qualitative reasoning behind its electronics troubleshooting, even though it ultimately relied on the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator. Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning, especially those relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, explicitly relied on representations of explanations, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.\n\nIn the 1980s through early 1990s, truth maintenance systems (TMS) were developed to extend the capabilities of causal-reasoning, rule-based, and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360-362}} A TMS acts to explicitly track alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces.  As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:\n{{Quote\n|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: \"Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.

The buses supplemented an earlier tram service.\n\nIn 1860, [[Birkenhead]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], had become the first town in Europe to operate a street tramway. It was started by [[George Francis Train]], an American, when he laid track from [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside Ferry]] to [[Birkenhead Park|Birkenhead Park Main Entrance]] and ran a horse drawn car service. On 4 February 1901, the Corporation of Birkenhead owned [[Birkenhead Corporation Tramways]] commenced operating, first to [[New Ferry]] and later around the town. It closed on 17 July 1937.\n\n==Livery==\n[[File:Woodside_Ferry_terminal,_1966_-_geograph.org.uk_-_657947.jpg|thumb|Birkenhead Transport buses at [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] Ferry Terminal in September 1966]]\n[[File:Birkenhead_%26_District_bus_4166_(HDB_116V),_SELNEC_40_event_(3).jpg|thumb|Preserved [[GM Buses]] Birkenhead & District liveried [[Northern Counties Motor & Engineering Company|Northern Counties]] bodied [[Daimler Fleetline]] in October 2009]]\nBirkenhead's first livery on trams and buses was maroon and cream with a white roof, but in 1934 Birkenhead's famous blue and cream livery was applied to a new [[AEC Q-type]] double-deck bus. It was the only one of its type operated by the Corporation but the blue and cream livery was applied to all future delivered buses with ''Birkenhead Corporation Motors'' applied in gold on the lower cream band.\n\nIn 1951, the Transport Department was reorganised, with the bus and ferry departments merging. A slight livery change gave more cream coverage around the lower deck windows and the legend was changed to read ''Birkenhead Transport''. White roofs had been overpainted blue during the war and with this revised livery the white roof was never re-applied. Livery name of blue was 'Cerulean' by the paint makers \"Docker Bros of 1935\", and the cream was the same as applied to the trams, named Birkenhead Corporation Cream.\n\n==Fleet==\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the average size of the Birkenhead fleet was 225 buses, the last traditional British half cab buses delivered to Birkenhead in 1967 were 15 Leyland Titan PD2/37 models with Massey 66 seat bodywork. Massey Brothers bodywork had been frequently selected by the Transport Department since 1931.\n\n==Merger==\nOn 1 December 1969, the municipal fleets of [[Liverpool]], Birkenhead and [[Wallasey]] came together as a result of the [[Transport Act 1968]], to form the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/3rd-october-1969/46/merseyside-pte-order-made Merseyside PTE order made] ''Commercial Motor'' 3 October 1969 page 46</ref>\n\n==Revival==\nIn 1994, the brand and livery were revived by [[GM Buses]] when it was engaged in [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom#Bus wars|bus war]] with [[MTL (transport company)|MTL]].

The buses supplemented an earlier tram service.\n\nIn 1860, [[Birkenhead]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], had become the first town in Europe to operate a street tramway. It was started by [[George Francis Train]], an American, when he laid track from [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside Ferry]] to [[Birkenhead Park|Birkenhead Park Main Entrance]] and ran a horse drawn car service. On 4 February 1901, the Corporation of Birkenhead owned [[Birkenhead Corporation Tramways]] commenced operating, first to [[New Ferry]] and later around the town. It closed on 17 July 1937.\n\n==Livery==\n[[File:Woodside_Ferry_terminal,_1966_-_geograph.org.uk_-_657947.jpg|thumb|Birkenhead Transport buses at [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] Ferry Terminal in September 1966]]\n[[File:Birkenhead_%26_District_bus_4166_(HDB_116V),_SELNEC_40_event_(3).jpg|thumb|Preserved [[GM Buses]] Birkenhead & District liveried [[Northern Counties Motor & Engineering Company|Northern Counties]] bodied [[Daimler Fleetline]] in October 2009]]\nBirkenhead's first livery on trams and buses was maroon and cream with a white roof, but in 1934 Birkenhead's famous blue and cream livery was applied to a new [[AEC Q-type]] double-deck bus. It was the only one of its type operated by the Corporation but the blue and cream livery was applied to all future delivered buses with ''Birkenhead Corporation Motors'' applied in gold on the lower cream band.\n\nIn 1951, the Transport Department was reorganised, with the bus and ferry departments merging. A slight livery change gave more cream coverage around the lower deck windows and the legend was changed to read ''Birkenhead Transport''. White roofs had been overpainted blue during the war and with this revised livery the white roof was never re-applied. Livery name of blue was 'Cerulean' by the paint makers \"Docker Bros of 1935\", and the cream was the same as applied to the trams, named Birkenhead Corporation Cream.\n\n==Fleet==\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the average size of the Birkenhead fleet was 225 buses, the last traditional British half cab buses delivered to Birkenhead in 1967 were 15 Leyland Titan PD2/37 models with Massey 66 seat bodywork. Massey Brothers bodywork had been frequently selected by the Transport Department since 1931.\n\n==Merger==\nOn 1 December 1969, the municipal fleets of [[Liverpool]], Birkenhead and [[Wallasey]] came together as a result of the [[Transport Act 1968]], to form the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/3rd-october-1969/46/merseyside-pte-order-made Merseyside PTE order made] ''Commercial Motor'' 3 October 1969 page 46</ref>\n\n==Revival==\nIn 1994, the brand and livery were revived by [[GM Buses]] when it was engaged in [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom#Bus wars|bus war]] with [[MTL (transport company)|MTL]]. It ceased in June 1995.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Wirral Transport Museum]]\n*[[List of bus operators of the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*''Local Transport in Birkenhead and District'' by T.B.
