The ROC, as well as its primate, officially ranks fifth in the Orthodox order of precedence, immediately below the four [[Pentarchy|ancient]] [[patriarchate]]s of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]: [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bogoslov.ru/text/192554.html|title=\u0414\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0445|accessdate=5 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028155139/http://www.bogoslov.ru/text/192554.html|archive-date=2012-10-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> {{As of|2018|October|15|df=US}}, the ROC suspended [[full communion|communion]] with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], having unilaterally [[Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism (2018)|severed ties]] in reaction to the establishment of the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]], which was finalised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 5 January 2019.\n\nThe [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], widely seen as the birth of the ROC, is believed to have occurred in 988 through the [[baptism]] of the Kievan prince [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] and his people by the clergy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, whose constituent part the ROC remained for the next six centuries, while the [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'|Kievan see]] remained in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate until 1686.\n\nThe ROC currently claims exclusive jurisdiction over the Orthodox Christians, irrespective of their ethnic background, who reside in the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|member republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]], excluding [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]. Such countries as [[Estonia]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]] dispute this claim and have established parallel canonical Orthodox jurisdictions: the [[Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church]], the [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]], and the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]], respectively. The ROC also exercises ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the [[Autonomy#Religion|autonomous]] [[Japanese Orthodox Church|Church of Japan]] and the [[Chinese Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] resident in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The ROC branches in [[Belarus]], Estonia, [[Latvia]], Moldova and [[Ukraine]] since the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s enjoy various degrees of self-government, albeit short of the status of formal ecclesiastical autonomy.\n\nThe ROC should not be confused with the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (OCA). It has been an  autocephalous Orthodox church since 1970, but it is not universally recognised in this status. The Ecumenical Patriarchate views it as a branch of the ROC. It traces its history in [[North America]] to the late 18th century, when Russian missionaries in [[Alaska]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) first established churches among the Alaska Natives and other indigenous peoples. \n\nThe ROC should also not be confused with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (also known as the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, or ROCOR), headquartered in the [[United States]]. The ROCOR was instituted in the 1920s by Russian communities outside [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]], which had refused to recognize the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate that was ''de facto'' headed by [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Sergius Stragorodsky]]. The two churches reconciled on May 17, 2007; the ROCOR is now a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Russian Orthodox Church}}\n\n[[File:Cross of the Russian Orthodox Church 01.svg|thumb|upright=0.35|The three-barred cross of the Russian Orthodox Church]]\n\n===Kievan period===\nThe Christian community that developed into what is now known as the Russian Orthodox Church is traditionally said to have been founded by the [[Saint Andrew|Apostle Andrew]], who is thought to have visited [[Scythia]] and [[Greek colonies]] along the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]].

In 863\u201369, the [[Byzantine]] monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], both from the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the Eastern Roman Empire translated parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language for the first time, paving the way for the Christianization of the Slavs and Slavicized peoples of [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Balkans]], [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern Russia]], [[Southern Russia]] and [[Central Russia]]. There is [[Christianization of the Rus' Khaganate|evidence that the first Christian bishop was sent to Novgorod from Constantinople]] either by [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] or [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatios]], c. 866\u2013867.\n\nBy the mid-10th century, there was already a Christian community among Kievan nobility, under the leadership of Bulgarian and Byzantine priests, although [[paganism]] remained the dominant religion. Princess [[Olga of Kiev]] was the first ruler of [[Kievan Rus\u2032]] who became a Christian. Her grandson, [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] of Kiev, made Rus' officially a Christian state. The official [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] is widely believed to have occurred in 988 AD, when Prince Vladimir was [[Baptism|baptised]] himself and ordered his people to be baptised by the priests from the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThe Kievan church was a junior [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolitanate]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] appointed the metropolitan, who usually was a [[Greeks|Greek]], who governed the Church of Rus'. The Kiev Metropolitan's residence was originally located in [[Kiev]] itself, the capital of the medieval [[Kievan Rus'|Rus' state]].\n\n===Transfer of the see to Moscow; ''de facto'' independence of the Moscow Church===\nAs Kiev was losing its political, cultural, and economical significance due to the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]], Metropolitan [[Maximus, Metropolitan of all Rus|Maximus]] moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1299; his successor, [[Metropolitan Peter]] moved the residence to [[Moscow]] in 1325.\n\nFollowing the tribulations of the Mongol invasion, the Russian Church was pivotal in the survival and life of the Russian state. Despite the politically motivated murders of [[Michael of Chernigov|Mikhail of Chernigov]] and [[Mikhail Yaroslavich|Mikhail of Tver]], the Mongols were generally tolerant and even granted tax exemption to the church. Such holy figures as [[Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev|Metropolitan Alexis]] helped the country{{clarify|date=October 2018}} to withstand years of Mongol rule, and to expand both economically and spiritually. The [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius|Trinity monastery]] north of Moscow founded by Sergius of Radonezh became the setting for the flourishing of spiritual art, exemplified by the work of [[Andrei Rublev|Andrey Rublev]], among others. The followers of Sergius founded four hundred monasteries, thus greatly extending the geographical extent of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n{{Further|15th-16th century Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism}}[[File:Miloradovichdefense.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Russian Orthodox monks defended the [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius|Trinity monastery]] against Polish troops during the [[Time of Troubles]] ([[Sergey Miloradovich]]).]]\n\nIn 1439, at the [[Council of Florence]], some Orthodox hierarchs from [[Byzantium]] as well as Metropolitan [[Isidore of Kiev|Isidore]], who represented the Russian Church, signed a [[Church union#The Uniates and the Edinoverie|union]] with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]], whereby the Eastern Church would recognise the primacy of the [[Pope]]. However, the Moscow Prince [[Vasili II]] rejected the act of the Council of Florence brought to Moscow by Isidore in March 1441. Isidore was in the same year removed from his position as an [[Apostasy|apostate]] and expelled from Moscow. The Russian metropolitanate remained effectively vacant for the next few years due largely to the dominance of [[Council of Florence#Council transferred to Ferrara and attempted re-union with the Orthodox Churches|Uniates]] in Constantinople then. In December 1448, [[Jonah Metropolitan of Moscow|Jonas]], a Russian bishop, was installed by the Council of Russian bishops in Moscow as Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pravenc.ru/text/578250.html |title = \u0418\u041e\u041d\u0410  |access-date=5 March 2015 }}</ref> (with permanent residence in Moscow) without the consent from Constantinople. This occurred five years prior to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and, unintentionally, signified the beginning of an effectively independent church structure in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscow]] (North-Eastern Russian) part of the Russian Church. Subsequently, there developed a theory in Moscow that saw [[Moscow as the Third Rome]], the legitimate successor to Constantinople, and the Primate of the Moscow Church as head of all the Russian Church. Meanwhile, the newly established in 1458 Russian Orthodox ([[Gregory II Bulgarian|initially Uniate]]) metropolitanate in Kiev (then in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and subsequently in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) continued under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical See until 1686, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of Moscow.\n\nThe reign of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] and his successor was plagued by a number of heresies and controversies. [[Non-possessors|One party]], led by [[Nil Sorsky]] and [[Vassian Kosoy]], called for the secularisation of monastic properties. They were opposed by the influential [[Joseph Volotsky|Joseph of Volotsk]], who defended ecclesiastical ownership of land and property. The sovereign's position fluctuated, but eventually he threw his support to Joseph. New sects sprang up, some of which showed a tendency to revert to [[Halakha|Mosaic law]]: for instance, the [[archpriest]] [[Aleksei (convert)|Aleksei]] converted to [[Judaism]] after meeting a certain [[Sect of Skhariya the Jew|Zechariah the Jew]].\n\nIn the 1540s, Metropolitan [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Macarius]] codified Russian [[hagiography]] and convened a number of church synods, which culminated in the [[Stoglavy Sobor|Hundred Chapter Council]] of 1551. This Council unified church ceremonies and duties throughout the Moscow Church. At the demand of the church hierarchy, the government lost its jurisdiction over ecclesiastics. Reinforced by these reforms, the Moscow Church felt powerful enough to occasionally challenge the policies of the [[tsar]]. Metropolitan [[Philip II, Metropolitan of Moscow|Philip]], in particular, decried the abuses of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]], who eventually engineered his deposition and murder.\n\n=== Autocephaly and schism ===\n[[File:Nikita Pustosviat. Dispute on the Confession of Faith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''An Old Believer Priest, [[Nikita Pustosviat]], Disputing with Patriarch Joachim the Matters of Faith.'' Painting by [[Vasily Perov]]]]\n\nDuring the reign of Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia|Fyodor I]] his brother-in-law [[Boris Godunov]] contacted the Ecumenical Patriarch, who \"was much embarrassed for want of funds,\"<ref>Karl August von Hase. ''A history of the Christian Church''. Oxford, 1855. p.&nbsp;481.</ref> with a view to establishing a patriarchal see in Moscow. As a result of Godunov's efforts, [[Patriarch Job of Moscow|Metropolitan Job]] of Moscow became in 1589 the first Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus', making the Russian Church [[autocephaly|autocephalous]]. The four other patriarchs have recognized the Moscow Patriarchate as one of the five honourable Patriarchates. During the next half a century, when the tsardom was weak, the patriarchs (notably [[Patriarch Hermogenes|Hermogenes]] and [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Philaret]]) would help run the state along with (and sometimes instead of) the tsars.\n\nAt the urging of the [[Zealots of Piety]], in 1652 [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] resolved to centralize power that had been distributed locally, while conforming Russian Orthodox rites and rituals to those of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], as interpreted by pundits from the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev Ecclesiastical Academy]]. For instance, he insisted that Russian Christians cross themselves with three fingers, rather than the then-traditional two. This aroused antipathy among a substantial section of believers, who saw the changed rites as heresy, although the extent to which these changes can be regarded as minor or major ritual significance remains open to debate. After the implementation of these innovations at the church council of 1666\u20131667, the church [[anathema]]tized and suppressed those who acted contrary to them with the support of Muscovite state power. These traditionalists became known as \"[[Old Believers]]\" or \"Old Ritualists\".\n\nAlthough Nikon's far-flung ambitions of steering the country to a [[theocracy|theocratic form of government]] precipitated his defrocking and exile, [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Aleksey]] deemed it reasonable to uphold many of his innovations. During the [[Raskol|Schism of the Russian Church]], the Old Ritualists were separated from the main body of the Orthodox Church. Archpriest [[Avvakum]] Petrov and many other opponents of the church reforms were burned at the stake, either forcibly or voluntarily. Another prominent figure within the Old Ritualists' movement, [[Feodosia Morozova|Boyarynya Morozova]], was starved to death in 1675. Others escaped from the government persecutions to [[Siberia]].\n\nSeveral years after the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav|Council of Pereyaslav]] (1654) that heralded the subsequent incorporation of eastern regions of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the see of the [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus']] was transferred to the Moscow Patriarchate (1686).\n\n===Peter the Great===\n{{Main|Church reform of Peter I}}\n\n[[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (1682\u20131725) had an agenda of radical modernization of Russian government, army, dress and manners. He made Russia a formidable political power. Peter was not religious and had a low regard for the Church, so he put it under tight governmental control. He replaced the Patriarch with a Holy Synod, which he controlled. The Tsar appointed all bishops.  A clerical career was not a route chosen by upper-class society. Most parish priests were sons of priests, were very poorly educated, and very poorly paid. The monks in the monasteries had a slightly higher status; they were not allowed to marry. Politically, the church was impotent.  Catherine the Great later in the 18th century seized most of the church lands, and put the priests on a small salary supplemented by fees for services such as baptism and marriage.<ref>Lindsey Hughes, ''Russia in the Age of Peter the Great'' (1998) pp.&nbsp;332\u201356.</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Russian Orthodox Church experienced a vast geographic expansion. Numerous financial and political incentives (as well as immunity from military service) were offered local political leaders who would convert to Orthodoxy, and bring their people with them.\n\nIn the following two centuries, missionary efforts stretched out across Siberia into [[History of Alaska|Alaska]]. Eminent people on that missionary effort included St. [[Innocent of Alaska|Innocent of Irkutsk]] and St. [[Herman of Alaska]]. In emulation of [[Stephen of Perm]], they learned local languages and translated gospels and hymns.

This was the situation until shortly after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]], at which time the Local Council (more than half of its members being lay persons) adopted the decision to restore the Patriarchy. On November 5 (according to the Julian calendar) a new patriarch, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Tikhon]], was named through [[Sortition|casting lots]].\n\nThe late 18th century saw the rise of ''[[starets|starchestvo]]'' under [[Paisius Velichkovsky|Paisiy Velichkovsky]] and his disciples at the [[Optina Monastery]]. This marked a beginning of a significant spiritual revival in the Russian Church after a lengthy period of modernization, personified by such figures as [[Dimitry of Rostov|Demetrius of Rostov]] and [[Platon Levshin|Platon of Moscow]]. [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Ivan Kireevsky]] and other lay theologians with [[Slavophile]] leanings elaborated some key concepts of the renovated Orthodox doctrine, including that of ''[[sobornost]]''. The resurgence of Eastern Orthodoxy was reflected in Russian literature, an example is the figure of [[Starets]] [[Zosima]] in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov|Brothers Karamazov]]''.\n\n===Fin-de-si\u00e8cle religious renaissance===\n[[File:Russisch Orthodoxe Kirche Dresden.JPG|thumb|Russian Orthodox church in [[Dresden]], built in the 1870s]]\n\nDuring the final decades of the imperial order in Russia many educated Russians sought to return to the church and tried to bring their faith back to life. No less evident were non-conformist paths of spiritual searching known as \"God-Seeking\". Writers, artists and intellectuals in large numbers were drawn to private prayer, mysticism, [[spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]] and Eastern religions. A fascination with primitive feeling, with the unconscious and the mythic was apparent, along with visions of coming catastrophes and redemption.\n\nIn 1909, a volume of essays appeared under the title ''[[Vekhi]]'' (\"Milestones\" or \"Landmarks\"), authored by a group of leading left-wing intellectuals, including [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Peter Berngardovich Struve|Peter Struve]] and former [[Marxism|Marxists]]. They bluntly repudiated the materialism and atheism that had dominated the thought of the intelligentsia for generations as leading inevitably to failure and moral disaster. The essays created a sensation.\n\nIt is possible to see a similarly renewed vigor and variety in religious life and spirituality among the lower classes, especially after the upheavals of 1905. Among the peasantry there was widespread interest in spiritual-ethical literature and non-conformist moral-spiritual movements, an upsurge in pilgrimage and other devotions to sacred spaces and objects (especially icons), persistent beliefs in the presence and power of the supernatural (apparitions, possession, walking-dead, demons, spirits, miracles and magic), the renewed vitality of local \"ecclesial communities\" actively shaping their own ritual and spiritual lives, sometimes in the absence of clergy, and defining their own sacred places and forms of piety. Also apparent was the proliferation of what the Orthodox establishment branded as \"sectarianism\", including both non-Orthodox Christian denominations, notably [[Baptists]], and various forms of popular Orthodoxy and mysticism.<ref>A.

The council continued its sessions until September 1918 and adopted a number of important reforms, including the restoration of [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarchy]], a decision taken 3 days after the [[Bolshevik]]s [[October Revolution|overthrew the Provisional Government]] in Petrograd on 25 October (O.S.). On 5 November, Metropolitan [[Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow|Tikhon of Moscow]] was selected as the first Russian Patriarch after about 300 years of the Synodal rule.\n\nIn early February 1918, the Bolshevik-controlled government of Soviet Russia enacted the [[Decree on separation of church from state and school from church]] that proclaimed [[separation of church and state]] in Russia, freedom to \"profess any religion or profess none\", deprived religious organisations of the right to own any property and legal status. Legal religious activity in the territories controlled by Bolsheviks was effectively reduced to services and sermons inside church buildings. The Decree and attempts by Bolshevik officials to requisition church property caused sharp resentment on the part of the ROC clergy and provoked violent clashes on some occasions: on 1 February (19 January O.S.), hours after the bloody confrontation in Petrograd's [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]] between the Bolsheviks trying to take control of the monastery's premises and the believers, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]] issued a proclamation that [[anathema]]tised the perpetrators of such acts.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://st-elizabet.narod.ru/raznoe/anafema_sovetchikam.htm |title = \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0444\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0432. \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u0422\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u044b\u0432 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443 |access-date = 5 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe church was caught in the crossfire of the [[Russian Civil War]] that began later in 1918, and church leadership, despite their attempts to be politically neutral (from the autumn of 1918), as well as the clergy generally were perceived by the Soviet authorities as a \"counter-revolutionary\" force and thus subject to suppression and eventual liquidation.\n\nIn the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ostling |first = Richard |title = Cross meets Kremlin |work = [[TIME Magazine]] |date = June 24, 2001 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html }}</ref>\n\n===Under Soviet rule===\n{{See also|Religion in the Soviet Union|Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union}}\n\n[[File:Tikhon of Moscow.jpg|thumb|Patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]]]]\n\nThe Soviet Union, formally created in December 1922, was the first state to have elimination of religion as an ideological objective espoused by the country's ruling political party.

Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed.\n\nOrthodox clergy and active believers were treated by the Soviet law-enforcement apparatus as anti-revolutionary elements and were habitually subjected to formal prosecutions on political charges, arrests, exiles, [[Gulag|imprisonment in camps]], and later could also be incarcerated in [[Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|mental hospitals]].<ref>''Father Arseny 1893\u20131973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.''

It was impossible to build new churches. Practising Orthodox Christians were restricted from prominent careers and membership in communist organizations (the party, the [[Komsomol]]). Anti-religious propaganda was openly sponsored and encouraged by the government, which the Church was not given an opportunity to publicly respond to. The government youth organization, the [[Komsomol]], encouraged its members to vandalize Orthodox churches and harass worshippers. Seminaries were closed down, and the church was restricted from using the press. Theological schools were closed (until some were re-opened in the latter 1940s), and church publications were suppressed.\n\nHowever, the Soviet policy vis-a-vis organised religion vacillated over time between, on the one hand, a utopian determination to substitute secular rationalism for what they considered to be an outmoded \"superstitious\" worldview and, on the other, pragmatic acceptance of the tenaciousness of religious faith and institutions. In any case, religious beliefs and practices did persist, not only in the domestic and private spheres but also in the scattered public spaces allowed by a state that recognized its failure to eradicate religion and the political dangers of an unrelenting culture war.<ref>John Shelton Curtis, ''The Russian Church and the Soviet State'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1953); Jane Ellis, ''The Russian Orthodox Church: A Contemporary History'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986); Dimitry V.

In the time between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1935, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death. Many thousands of victims of persecution became recognized in a special canon of saints known as the \"[[New Martyr|new martyrs]] and confessors of Russia\".\n\nWhen Patriarch Tikhon died in 1925, the Soviet authorities forbade patriarchal election. Patriarchal ''locum tenens'' (acting Patriarch) [[Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow|Metropolitan Sergius]] (Stragorodsky, 1887\u20131944), going against the opinion of a major part of the church's parishes, in 1927 issued a declaration accepting the Soviet authority over the church as legitimate, pledging the church's cooperation with the government and condemning political dissent within the church. By this declaration Sergius granted himself authority that he, being a deputy of imprisoned [[Peter of Krutitsy|Metropolitan Peter]] and acting against his will, had no right to assume according to the XXXIV [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic canon]], which led to a split with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] abroad and the [[Russian True Orthodox Church]] (Russian Catacomb Church) within the Soviet Union, as they allegedly remained faithful to the Canons of the Apostles, declaring the part of the church led by Metropolitan Sergius [[schism (religion)|schism]], sometimes coined ''Sergianism''.

Most of Evlogy's parishes in Western Europe remained loyal to him; Evlogy then petitioned Ecumenical Patriarch [[Photius II of Constantinople|Photius II]] to be received under his canonical care and was received in 1931, making a number of parishes of Russian Orthodox Christians outside Russia, especially in Western Europe an [[Exarchate]] of the Ecumenical Patriarchate as the [[Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe]].\n\n[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph taken of the 1931 demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow]]\n\nMoreover, in the [[1929 Soviet Union legislative election|1929 elections]], the Orthodox Church attempted to formulate itself as a full-scale opposition group to the Communist Party, and attempted to run candidates of its own against the Communist candidates. Article 124 of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] officially allowed for freedom of religion within the Soviet Union, and along with initial statements of it being a multi-candidate election, the Church again attempted to run its own religious candidates in the [[1937 Soviet Union legislative election|1937 elections]]. However the support of multicandidate elections was retracted several months before the elections were held and in neither 1929 nor 1937 were any candidates of the Orthodox Church elected.<ref>[[Sheila Fitzpatrick|Fitzpatrick, Sheila]]. 1999.

On September 4, 1943, Metropolitans Sergius (Stragorodsky), [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Alexius (Simansky)]] and [[Nicholas (Yarushevich)]] had a meeting with Stalin and received a permission to convene a council on September 8, 1943, which elected Sergius Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus'. This is considered by some as violation of the XXX [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic canon]], as no church hierarch could be consecrated by secular authorities.<ref name=\"14spravka\"/> A new patriarch was elected, theological schools were opened, and thousands of churches began to function. The [[Slavic Greek Latin Academy|Moscow Theological Academy Seminary]], which had been closed since 1918, was re-opened.\n\nIn December 2017, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] lifted classified top secret status of documents revealing that the [[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKVD]] of the USSR and its units were engaged in the selection of candidates for participation in the [[1945 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|1945 Local Council]] from the representatives of the clergy and the laity. NKVD demanded \"to outline persons who have religious authority among the clergy and believers, and at the same time checked for civic or patriotic work\". In the letter sent in September 1944, it was emphasized: \"It is important to ensure that the number of nominated candidates is dominated by the agents of the NKBD, capable of holding the line that we need at the Council\".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://espreso.tv/news/2017/12/10/moskovskyy_patriarkhat_stvoryuvaly_agenty_nkvs_svidchat_rozskerecheni_sbu_dokumenty |title = \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u041d\u041a\u0412\u0421, \u2013 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0421\u0411\u0423 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 |website = espreso.tv }}</ref><ref>[https://www.znak.com/2017-12-10/sbu_rassekretila_arhivy_moskovskogo_patriarha_v_1945_godu_izbirali_agenty_nkgb \u0421\u0411\u0423 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432\u044b: \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u0432 1945 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u041d\u041a\u0413\u0411]</ref>\n\nBetween 1945 and 1959 the official organization of the church was greatly expanded, although individual members of the clergy were occasionally arrested and exiled. The number of open churches reached 25,000. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. This decline was evident from the dramatic decay of many of the abandoned churches and monasteries that were previously common in even the smallest villages from the pre-revolutionary period.\n\n====Persecution under Khrushchev====\nA new and widespread persecution of the church was subsequently instituted under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. A second round of repression, harassment and church closures took place between 1959 and 1964 when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was in office. The number of Orthodox churches fell from around 22,000 in 1959 to around 8,000 in 1965;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tsarist and Communist Russia 1855\u20131964|last=Sally|first=Waller|isbn=9780198354673|edition= Second |location=Oxford|oclc=913789474}}</ref> priests, monks and faithful were killed or imprisoned and the number of functioning monasteries was reduced to less than twenty.\n\nSubsequent to Khrushchev's overthrow, the Church and the government remained on unfriendly terms until 1988. In practice, the most important aspect of this conflict was that openly religious people could not join the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which meant that they could not hold any political office. However, among the general population, large numbers remained religious.\n\nSome Orthodox believers and even priests took part in the [[dissident]] movement and became [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]]. The Orthodox priests [[Gleb Yakunin]], Sergiy Zheludkov and others spent years in Soviet prisons and exile for their efforts in defending freedom of worship.<ref>\"Dissent in the Russian Orthodox Church,\" ''Russian Review'', Vol. 28, N 4, October 1969, pp. 416\u201327.</ref> Among the prominent figures of that time were Father Dmitri Dudko<ref name=\"Dudko\">\"Father Dmitri Dudko\".

Although he tried to keep away from practical work of the dissident movement intending to better fulfil his calling as a priest, there was a spiritual link between Fr Aleksandr and many of the dissidents. For some of them he was a friend; for others, a godfather; for many (including [[Yakunin]]), a spiritual father.<ref>''Keston Institute and the Defence of Persecuted Christians in the USSR''</ref>\n\nBy 1987 the number of functioning churches in the [[Soviet Union]] had fallen to 6,893 and the number of functioning monasteries to just 18. In 1987 in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], between 40% and 50% of newborn babies (depending on the region) were baptized. Over 60% of all deceased received Christian funeral services.\n\n==== Glasnost and evidence of KGB links ====\n{{Main|Glasnost}}\n\nBeginning  in the late 1980s, under Mikhail Gorbachev, the new political and social freedoms resulted in many church buildings being returned to the church, to be restored by local parishioners. A pivotal point in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church came in 1988, the millennial anniversary of the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Baptism of Kievan Rus']]. Throughout the summer of that year, major government-supported celebrations took place in Moscow and other cities; many older churches and some monasteries were reopened. An implicit ban on religious propaganda on state TV was finally lifted. For the first time in the history of the Soviet Union, people could see live transmissions of church services on television.\n\n[[Gleb Yakunin]], a critic of the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] who was one of those who briefly gained access to the [[KGB]] archive documents in the early 1990s, argued that the Moscow Patriarchate was \"practically a subsidiary, a sister company of the KGB\".<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119792074745834591?mod=hpp_us_inside_today Born Again.

This point of view was based upon the stance of the Russian Orthodox Church (and the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]]) that the Church of Rome is in schism, after breaking off from the Orthodox Church. The Roman Catholic Church, on the other hand, while acknowledging the primacy of the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia, believed that the small Roman Catholic minority in Russia, in continuous existence since at least the 18th century, should be served by a fully developed church hierarchy with a presence and status in Russia, just as the Russian Orthodox Church is present in other countries (including constructing a cathedral in Rome, near the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]).\n\nThere occurred strident conflicts with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, most notably over the Orthodox Church in [[Estonia]] in the mid-1990s, which resulted in [[1996 Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism|unilateral suspension of eucharistic relationship between the churches by the ROC]].<ref>\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u044f \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0445\u0443 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u044e I \u043e\u0442 23 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f 1996 // [[:ru:\u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0438|\u0416\u041c\u041f]] 1996, \u2116 3 (\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c).</ref> The tension lingered on and could be observed at the meeting in Ravenna in early October 2007 of participants in the Orthodox\u2013Catholic Dialogue: the representative of the Moscow Patriarchate, Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]], walked out of the meeting due to the presence of representatives from the [[Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church]] which is in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

of Moscow and all Rus']]]]\n\nThe ROC constituent parts in other than the Russian Federation countries of its exclusive jurisdiction such as Ukraine, Belarus et al., are legally registered as separate legal entities in accordance with the relevant legislation of those independent states.\n\nEcclesiastiacally, the ROC is organized in a hierarchical structure. The lowest level of organization, which normally would be a single ROC building and its attendees, headed by a priest who acts as Father superior ({{lang-ru|\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c}}, ''nastoyatel''), constitute a [[parish]] ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434}}, ''prihod''). All parishes in a geographical region belong to an [[eparchy]] ({{lang-ru|\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u044f}}\u2014equivalent to a Western [[diocese]]). Eparchies are governed by [[bishop]]s ({{lang-ru|\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f}}, [[Bishop|episcop]] or \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439, [[archiereus]]). There are 261 Russian Orthodox eparchies worldwide (June 2012).\n\nFurther, some eparchies may be organized into [[exarch]]ates (currently the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Belorussian exarchate]]), and since 2003 into metropolitan districts (\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433), such as the ROC eparchies in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]] (\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433).\n\n[[File:Blagoveschenskij sobor Pavlodar 001.JPG|thumb|Cathedral of the Annunciation in [[Pavlodar]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\nSince the early 1990s, the ROC eparchies in some newly independent states of the former USSR enjoy the status of [[self-governing]] Churches within the Moscow Patriarchate (which status, according to the ROC legal terminology, is distinct from the \u2033autonomous\u2033 one): the [[Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate]], [[Latvian Orthodox Church]], [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], the last one being virtually fully independent in administrative matters. Similar status, since 2007, is enjoyed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (previously fully independent and deemed schismatic by the ROC). The [[Chinese Orthodox Church]] and the [[Japanese Orthodox Church]]es were granted full autonomy by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this autonomy is not universally recognized.\n\nSmaller eparchies are usually governed by a single bishop. Larger eparchies, exarchates, and self-governing Churches are governed by a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan archbishop]] and sometimes also have one or more bishops assigned to them.\n\nThe highest level of authority in the ROC is vested in the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Local Council]] (''Pomestny Sobor''), which comprises all the bishops as well as representatives from the clergy and laypersons. Another organ of power is the [[Bishops' Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Bishops' Council]] (''\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440''). In the periods between the Councils the highest administrative powers are exercised by the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]], which includes seven permanent members and is chaired by the [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], Primate of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nAlthough the Patriarch of Moscow enjoys extensive administrative powers, unlike the [[Pope]], he has no direct canonical jurisdiction outside the [[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u044f|diocese of Moscow]], nor does he have single-handed authority over matters pertaining to faith as well as issues concerning the entire Orthodox Christian community such as the [[East\u2013West Schism|Catholic-Orthodox split]].\n\n===Orthodox Church in America (OCA)===\n{{main|Orthodox Church in America}}\nRussian traders settled in Alaska during the 18th century. In 1740, a Russian ship off the Alaskan coast recorded celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]]. In 1794, the Russian Orthodox Church sent missionaries\u2014among them [[Herman of Alaska]] (who was later canonized)\u2014to establish a formal mission in Alaska. Their missionary endeavors contributed to the conversion of many Alaskan natives to the Orthodox faith, especially after they learned the local languages and began to translate the liturgy into these. The ROC established a diocese, whose first bishop was [[Innocent of Alaska]] (also later canonized). Around the mid-19th century, the ROC moved this headquarters of the North American Diocese from Alaska to northern California.\n[[File:Alaska Russian Orthodox Church.jpg|thumb|right|Orthodox churches are common in [[Alaska]], particularly in the southern and southwest portions of the state, areas of Russian missionaries and settlement.]]\n[[File:OCA bishops in Saint Tikhon's Monastery and Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|Bishops of the Orthodox Church in America, at [[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary]]]]\n\nFollowing additional changes in population, the headquarters of the North American Diocese was moved in the late 19th century from California to [[New York City]], which had become a destination of numerous Greek and other Orthodox immigrants. At this time, many Greek Catholics shifted into the Orthodox Church in the East of the United States, increasing the numbers of Orthodox Christians in America. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThere had been a conflict between [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], the politically powerful Roman Catholic [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Saint Paul, Minnesota]]; and [[Alexis Toth]], an influential [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]] priest of St. Mary's church in Minneapolis. Because Archbishop Ireland refused to accept Fr. Toth's credentials as a priest, Fr Toth converted his parish of St. Mary's to the Orthodox Church. Under his guidance and inspiration, tens of thousands of other Greek Catholics in North America converted to the Orthodox Church. Ireland is sometimes honored as the \"Father of the [[Orthodox Church in America]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Such Greek Catholics were received into Orthodoxy into the existing North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church. \n\nAt the same time large numbers of Greek and other Orthodox Christians were also immigrating to America. All Orthodox Christians in North America were united under the ''[[omophorion]]'' (church authority and protection) of the Patriarch of Moscow, through the Russian Church's North American diocese. There was then no other Orthodox diocese on the continent. A Syro-Arab mission was established under the episcopal leadership of Fr. [[Raphael of Brooklyn]] (later canonized in the church), who was the first Orthodox bishop to be consecrated in the United States. \n\nIn 1920, after the Russian Revolution and establishment of the Soviet Union, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]] of Moscow issued an ''[[ukase]]'' (decree) that dioceses of the Church of Russia that were cut off from the governance of the highest Church authority should be managed independently until such time as normal relations could be resumed. Accordingly, the North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church (known as the \"Metropolia\") operated in a ''de facto'' autonomous mode of self-governance. The Russian Revolution resulted in financial hardship for the  North American diocese, as well as for the church in the Soviet Union. Other national Orthodox communities in North America tended to turn to the churches in their respective homelands for pastoral care and governance.\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin in the United States 13-16 November 2001-53.jpg|thumb|A commemoration service for the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] at St. Nicholas Cathedral in [[New York City]]]]\nA group of bishops who had left Russia as refugees in the wake of the [[Russian Civil War]], gathered in [[Sremski Karlovci|Sremski-Karlovci]]. This was traditionally known as the seat of [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] under the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1918, following the Great War, this city became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and, subsequently that year, of the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The bishops adopted a pro-monarchist stand. They claimed to speak as a synod for the entire \"free\" Russian church. This group was formally dissolved in 1922 by Patriarch Tikhon. He appointed metropolitans Platon and Evlogy as ruling bishops in the United States and Europe, respectively. Both of these metropolitans continued to entertain relations intermittently with the synod in Karlovci. Many of the Russian emigrants ignored Patriarch Tikhon's attempts to control the church outside Russia, believing that he was too subservient to the Soviets.\n\nBetween the world wars, the Metropolia coexisted and at times cooperated with an independent [[synod]], later known as the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (ROCOR), sometimes called the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. The two groups eventually operated independently. After World War II, ROCOR moved its headquarters to North America, following renewed Russian immigration especially to the United States. It claimed but failed to establish jurisdiction over all parishes of Russian origin in North America. The Metropolia, as a former diocese of the Russian Church, continued to consider the latter  as its highest church authority, although it was cut off under the conditions of the Communist regime in Russia.\n\nAfter World War II, the Patriarchate of Moscow made unsuccessful attempts to regain control over the groups abroad. After resuming communication with Moscow in early 1960s, and being granted [[autocephaly]] in 1970, the Metropolia became known as the [[Orthodox Church in America]].<ref>Very Rev.

The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] (under whom is the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]) and some other jurisdictions have not officially accepted it. The Ecumenical Patriarch and the other jurisdictions remain in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the OCA. The Patriarchate of Moscow thereby renounced its former canonical claims in the United States and Canada; it acknowledged an autonomous church also established in Japan in 1970.\n\n===Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR)===\n{{main|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}\nRussia's Church was devastated by the repercussions of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]]. One of its effects was a flood of refugees from Russia to the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Europe]]. The Revolution of 1918 severed large sections of the Russian church\u2014dioceses in America, Japan, and Manchuria, as well as refugees in Europe\u2014from regular contacts with the main church.\n\nBased on an ''[[ukase]]'' (decree) issued by [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]], Holy Synod and Supreme Council of the Church stated that ''dioceses'' of the Church of Russia that were cut off from the governance of the highest Church authority (i.e. the Holy Synod and the Patriarch) should be managed independently until such time as normal relations with the highest Church authority could be resumed, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was established; by bishops who had left Russia in the wake of the Russian Civil War. They first met in Constantinople, and then moved to Sremski-Karlovci, Yugoslavia. After World War II, they moved their headquarters to Munich, and 1950 to [[New York City]], New York, where it remains to this day.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, it was officially announced that the [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate|Act of Canonical Communion]] would finally be signed between the ROC and ROCOR. The signing took place on the May 17, 2007, followed immediately by a full restoration of [[full communion|communion]] with the Moscow Patriarchate, celebrated by a Divine Liturgy at the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], at which the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow|Alexius II]] and the First Hierarch of ROCOR concelebrated for the first time.\n\nUnder the Act, the ROCOR remains a self-governing entity within the Church of Russia. It is independent in its administrative, pastoral, and property matters. It continues to be governed by its Council of Bishops and its Synod, the Council's permanent executive body. The First-Hierarch and bishops of the ROCOR are elected by its Council and confirmed by the Patriarch of Moscow. ROCOR bishops participate in the Council of Bishops of the entire Russian Church.\n\nIn response to the signing of the act of canonical communion, Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Odessa and parishes and clergy in opposition to the Act broke communion with ROCOR, and established ROCA(A)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sinod.ruschurchabroad.org/engindex.htm |title=Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCA), Synod of Bishops |publisher=Sinod.ruschurchabroad.org |date=|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> Some others opposed to the Act have joined themselves to other [[Greek Old Calendarists|Greek Old Calendarist]] groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/eng2007/7ensfcommunique.html|title=The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia \u2013 Official Website|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016172842/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/eng2007/7ensfcommunique.html|archivedate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nCurrently both the OCA and ROCOR, since 2007, are in communion with the ROC.\n\n=== Self-governing branches of the ROC ===\n[[File:Foros in 02.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Foros Church|Church of the Resurrection of Christ]], near [[Yalta]], [[Crimea]].]]\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has four levels of self-government.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141219144758/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/12/19/7052645/ Belarusian Orthodox Church wants autonomy from Moscow].

Such rights belong to the ruling hierarch and it can only happen when the blessing of the patriarch is received. The task of believers of the local eparchy is to record descriptions of miracles, to create the hagiography of a saint, to paint an icon, as well as to compose a liturgical text of a service where the saint is canonized. All of this is sent to the Synodal Commission for canonization which decides whether to canonize the local hero of faith or not. Then the patriarch gives his blessing and the local hierarch performs the act of canonization at the local level. However, the liturgical texts in honor of a saint are not published in all Church books but only in local publications. In the same way these saints are not yet canonized and venerated by the whole Church, only locally. When the glorification of a saint exceeds the limits of an eparchy, then the patriarch and Holy Synod decides about their canonization on the Church level. After receiving the Synod's support and the patriarch's blessing, the question of glorification of a particular saint on the scale of the entire Church is given for consideration to the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the period following the revolution, and during the communist persecutions up to 1970, no canonizations took place. Only in 1970 did the Holy Synod made a decision to canonize a missionary to Japan, Nicholas Kasatkin (1836\u20131912). In 1977, St. Innocent of Moscow (1797\u20131879), the Metropolitan of Siberia, the Far East, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and Moscow was also canonized. In 1978 it was proclaimed that the Russian Orthodox Church had created a prayer order for Meletius of Kharkov, which practically signified his canonization because that was the only possible way to do it at that time. Similarly, the saints of other Orthodox Churches were added to the Church calendar: in 1962 St. John the Russian, in 1970 St. Herman of Alaska, in 1993 [[Silouan the Athonite]], the elder of Mount Athos, already canonized in 1987 by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. In the 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church re-established the process for canonization; a practice that had ceased for half a century.\n\nIn 1989, the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church|Holy Synod]] established the Synodal Commission for canonization. The [[1990 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]] gave an order for the Synodal Commission for Canonisation to prepare documents for canonization of new martyrs who had suffered from the 20th century Communist repressions. In 1991 it was decided that a local commission for canonization would be established in every eparchy which would gather the local documents and would send them to the Synodal Commission. Its task was to study the local archives, collect memories of believers, record all the miracles that are connected with addressing the martyrs. In 1992 the Church established 25 January as a day when it venerates the new 20th century martyrs of faith. The day was specifically chosen because on this day in 1918 the Metropolitan of Kiev Vladimir (Bogoyavlensky) was killed, thus becoming the first victim of communist terror among the hierarchs of the Church.\n\nDuring the 2000 Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, the greatest general canonization in the history of the Orthodox Church took place: not only regarding the number of saints but also as in this canonization, all unknown saints were mentioned. There were 1,765 canonized saints known by name and others unknown by name but \"known to God\".\n\n===Icon painting===\n{{main|Russian icons}}\n[[File:Andrej Rubl\u00ebv 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrei Rublev]] [[Trinity]] c. 1400 ]]\nThe use and making of [[icon]]s entered [[Kievan Rus']] following [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|its conversion]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in AD 988. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by [[Byzantine art]], led from the capital in [[Constantinople]]. As time passed, the Russians widened the vocabulary of types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere in the Orthodox world. Russian icons are typically [[Panel painting|paintings on wood]], often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be much larger. Some Russian icons were made of copper.<ref>Ahlborn, Richard E. and Vera Beaver-Bricken Espinola, eds. Russian Copper Icons and Crosses From the Kunz Collection: Castings of Faith. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press. 1991. 85 pages with illustrations, some colored. Includes bibliographical references pp. 84\u201385. Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology: No. 51.</ref> Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner. There is a rich history and elaborate religious symbolism associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an [[iconostasis]] (Russian ''ikonostas'', \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0441), or icon-screen, a wall of icons with double doors in the centre. Russians sometimes speak of an icon as having been \"written\", because in the Russian language (like Greek, but unlike English) the same word (''pisat''', \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c in Russian) means both to paint and to write. Icons are considered to be the Gospel in paint, and therefore careful attention is paid to ensure that the Gospel is faithfully and accurately conveyed. Icons considered miraculous were [[Acheiropoieta|said to \"appear.\"]] The \"appearance\" (Russian: ''yavlenie'', \u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) of an icon is its supposedly miraculous discovery. \"A true icon is one that has 'appeared', a gift from above, one opening the way to the Prototype and able to perform miracles\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Russian Icons |author=Father Vladimir Ivanov |publisher=Rizzoli Publications |year=1988}}</ref>\n\n===Bell ringing===\n{{main|Russian Orthodox bell ringing}}\n{{Expand section|[[Russian Orthodox bell ringing]]|date=December 2015}}\nBell ringing, which has a history in the Russian Orthodox tradition dating back to the [[baptism of Rus']], plays an important part in the traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n==Ecumenism and interfaith relations==\n[[File:Church of Mary Magdalene3.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Mary Magdalene]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]\nIn May 2011, [[Hilarion Alfeyev]], the Metropolitan of Volokolamsk and head of [[external relations for the Moscow Patriarchate]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, stated that Orthodox and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christians share the same positions on \"such issues as [[pro-life|abortion]], the [[Family values#Conservative definitions|family]], and [[Christian views on marriage|marriage]]\" and desire \"vigorous grassroots engagement\" between the two [[Communion (Christian)|Christian communions]] on such issues.<ref name=\"Communions\">{{cite magazine|url= http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/may/fromrussialove.html?start=1|title=From Russia, with Love|quote=Many evangelicals share conservative positions with us on such issues as abortion, the family, and marriage.

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] churches. The primate of the ROC is the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']]. The ROC, as well as its primate, officially ranks fifth in the Orthodox order of precedence, immediately below the four [[Pentarchy|ancient]] [[patriarchate]]s of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]: [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bogoslov.ru/text/192554.html|title=\u0414\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0445|accessdate=5 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028155139/http://www.bogoslov.ru/text/192554.html|archive-date=2012-10-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> {{As of|2018|October|15|df=US}}, the ROC suspended [[full communion|communion]] with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], having unilaterally [[Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism (2018)|severed ties]] in reaction to the establishment of the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]], which was finalised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 5 January 2019.\n\nThe [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], widely seen as the birth of the ROC, is believed to have occurred in 988 through the [[baptism]] of the Kievan prince [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] and his people by the clergy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, whose constituent part the ROC remained for the next six centuries, while the [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'|Kievan see]] remained in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate until 1686.\n\nThe ROC currently claims exclusive jurisdiction over the Orthodox Christians, irrespective of their ethnic background, who reside in the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|member republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]], excluding [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]. Such countries as [[Estonia]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]] dispute this claim and have established parallel canonical Orthodox jurisdictions: the [[Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church]], the [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]], and the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]], respectively. The ROC also exercises ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the [[Autonomy#Religion|autonomous]] [[Japanese Orthodox Church|Church of Japan]] and the [[Chinese Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] resident in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The ROC branches in [[Belarus]], Estonia, [[Latvia]], Moldova and [[Ukraine]] since the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s enjoy various degrees of self-government, albeit short of the status of formal ecclesiastical autonomy.\n\nThe ROC should not be confused with the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (OCA). It has been an  autocephalous Orthodox church since 1970, but it is not universally recognised in this status. The Ecumenical Patriarchate views it as a branch of the ROC. It traces its history in [[North America]] to the late 18th century, when Russian missionaries in [[Alaska]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) first established churches among the Alaska Natives and other indigenous peoples. \n\nThe ROC should also not be confused with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (also known as the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, or ROCOR), headquartered in the [[United States]]. The ROCOR was instituted in the 1920s by Russian communities outside [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]], which had refused to recognize the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate that was ''de facto'' headed by [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Sergius Stragorodsky]]. The two churches reconciled on May 17, 2007; the ROCOR is now a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Russian Orthodox Church}}\n\n[[File:Cross of the Russian Orthodox Church 01.svg|thumb|upright=0.35|The three-barred cross of the Russian Orthodox Church]]\n\n===Kievan period===\nThe Christian community that developed into what is now known as the Russian Orthodox Church is traditionally said to have been founded by the [[Saint Andrew|Apostle Andrew]], who is thought to have visited [[Scythia]] and [[Greek colonies]] along the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]].

In 863\u201369, the [[Byzantine]] monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], both from the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the Eastern Roman Empire translated parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language for the first time, paving the way for the Christianization of the Slavs and Slavicized peoples of [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Balkans]], [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern Russia]], [[Southern Russia]] and [[Central Russia]]. There is [[Christianization of the Rus' Khaganate|evidence that the first Christian bishop was sent to Novgorod from Constantinople]] either by [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] or [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatios]], c. 866\u2013867.\n\nBy the mid-10th century, there was already a Christian community among Kievan nobility, under the leadership of Bulgarian and Byzantine priests, although [[paganism]] remained the dominant religion. Princess [[Olga of Kiev]] was the first ruler of [[Kievan Rus\u2032]] who became a Christian. Her grandson, [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] of Kiev, made Rus' officially a Christian state. The official [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] is widely believed to have occurred in 988 AD, when Prince Vladimir was [[Baptism|baptised]] himself and ordered his people to be baptised by the priests from the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThe Kievan church was a junior [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolitanate]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] appointed the metropolitan, who usually was a [[Greeks|Greek]], who governed the Church of Rus'. The Kiev Metropolitan's residence was originally located in [[Kiev]] itself, the capital of the medieval [[Kievan Rus'|Rus' state]].\n\n===Transfer of the see to Moscow; ''de facto'' independence of the Moscow Church===\nAs Kiev was losing its political, cultural, and economical significance due to the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]], Metropolitan [[Maximus, Metropolitan of all Rus|Maximus]] moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1299; his successor, [[Metropolitan Peter]] moved the residence to [[Moscow]] in 1325.\n\nFollowing the tribulations of the Mongol invasion, the Russian Church was pivotal in the survival and life of the Russian state. Despite the politically motivated murders of [[Michael of Chernigov|Mikhail of Chernigov]] and [[Mikhail Yaroslavich|Mikhail of Tver]], the Mongols were generally tolerant and even granted tax exemption to the church. Such holy figures as [[Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev|Metropolitan Alexis]] helped the country{{clarify|date=October 2018}} to withstand years of Mongol rule, and to expand both economically and spiritually. The [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius|Trinity monastery]] north of Moscow founded by Sergius of Radonezh became the setting for the flourishing of spiritual art, exemplified by the work of [[Andrei Rublev|Andrey Rublev]], among others. The followers of Sergius founded four hundred monasteries, thus greatly extending the geographical extent of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n{{Further|15th-16th century Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism}}[[File:Miloradovichdefense.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Russian Orthodox monks defended the [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius|Trinity monastery]] against Polish troops during the [[Time of Troubles]] ([[Sergey Miloradovich]]).]]\n\nIn 1439, at the [[Council of Florence]], some Orthodox hierarchs from [[Byzantium]] as well as Metropolitan [[Isidore of Kiev|Isidore]], who represented the Russian Church, signed a [[Church union#The Uniates and the Edinoverie|union]] with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]], whereby the Eastern Church would recognise the primacy of the [[Pope]]. However, the Moscow Prince [[Vasili II]] rejected the act of the Council of Florence brought to Moscow by Isidore in March 1441. Isidore was in the same year removed from his position as an [[Apostasy|apostate]] and expelled from Moscow. The Russian metropolitanate remained effectively vacant for the next few years due largely to the dominance of [[Council of Florence#Council transferred to Ferrara and attempted re-union with the Orthodox Churches|Uniates]] in Constantinople then. In December 1448, [[Jonah Metropolitan of Moscow|Jonas]], a Russian bishop, was installed by the Council of Russian bishops in Moscow as Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pravenc.ru/text/578250.html |title = \u0418\u041e\u041d\u0410  |access-date=5 March 2015 }}</ref> (with permanent residence in Moscow) without the consent from Constantinople. This occurred five years prior to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and, unintentionally, signified the beginning of an effectively independent church structure in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscow]] (North-Eastern Russian) part of the Russian Church. Subsequently, there developed a theory in Moscow that saw [[Moscow as the Third Rome]], the legitimate successor to Constantinople, and the Primate of the Moscow Church as head of all the Russian Church. Meanwhile, the newly established in 1458 Russian Orthodox ([[Gregory II Bulgarian|initially Uniate]]) metropolitanate in Kiev (then in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and subsequently in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) continued under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical See until 1686, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of Moscow.\n\nThe reign of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] and his successor was plagued by a number of heresies and controversies. [[Non-possessors|One party]], led by [[Nil Sorsky]] and [[Vassian Kosoy]], called for the secularisation of monastic properties. They were opposed by the influential [[Joseph Volotsky|Joseph of Volotsk]], who defended ecclesiastical ownership of land and property. The sovereign's position fluctuated, but eventually he threw his support to Joseph. New sects sprang up, some of which showed a tendency to revert to [[Halakha|Mosaic law]]: for instance, the [[archpriest]] [[Aleksei (convert)|Aleksei]] converted to [[Judaism]] after meeting a certain [[Sect of Skhariya the Jew|Zechariah the Jew]].\n\nIn the 1540s, Metropolitan [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Macarius]] codified Russian [[hagiography]] and convened a number of church synods, which culminated in the [[Stoglavy Sobor|Hundred Chapter Council]] of 1551. This Council unified church ceremonies and duties throughout the Moscow Church. At the demand of the church hierarchy, the government lost its jurisdiction over ecclesiastics. Reinforced by these reforms, the Moscow Church felt powerful enough to occasionally challenge the policies of the [[tsar]]. Metropolitan [[Philip II, Metropolitan of Moscow|Philip]], in particular, decried the abuses of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]], who eventually engineered his deposition and murder.\n\n=== Autocephaly and schism ===\n[[File:Nikita Pustosviat. Dispute on the Confession of Faith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''An Old Believer Priest, [[Nikita Pustosviat]], Disputing with Patriarch Joachim the Matters of Faith.'' Painting by [[Vasily Perov]]]]\n\nDuring the reign of Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia|Fyodor I]] his brother-in-law [[Boris Godunov]] contacted the Ecumenical Patriarch, who \"was much embarrassed for want of funds,\"<ref>Karl August von Hase. ''A history of the Christian Church''. Oxford, 1855. p.&nbsp;481.</ref> with a view to establishing a patriarchal see in Moscow. As a result of Godunov's efforts, [[Patriarch Job of Moscow|Metropolitan Job]] of Moscow became in 1589 the first Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus', making the Russian Church [[autocephaly|autocephalous]]. The four other patriarchs have recognized the Moscow Patriarchate as one of the five honourable Patriarchates. During the next half a century, when the tsardom was weak, the patriarchs (notably [[Patriarch Hermogenes|Hermogenes]] and [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Philaret]]) would help run the state along with (and sometimes instead of) the tsars.\n\nAt the urging of the [[Zealots of Piety]], in 1652 [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] resolved to centralize power that had been distributed locally, while conforming Russian Orthodox rites and rituals to those of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], as interpreted by pundits from the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev Ecclesiastical Academy]]. For instance, he insisted that Russian Christians cross themselves with three fingers, rather than the then-traditional two. This aroused antipathy among a substantial section of believers, who saw the changed rites as heresy, although the extent to which these changes can be regarded as minor or major ritual significance remains open to debate. After the implementation of these innovations at the church council of 1666\u20131667, the church [[anathema]]tized and suppressed those who acted contrary to them with the support of Muscovite state power. These traditionalists became known as \"[[Old Believers]]\" or \"Old Ritualists\".\n\nAlthough Nikon's far-flung ambitions of steering the country to a [[theocracy|theocratic form of government]] precipitated his defrocking and exile, [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Aleksey]] deemed it reasonable to uphold many of his innovations. During the [[Raskol|Schism of the Russian Church]], the Old Ritualists were separated from the main body of the Orthodox Church. Archpriest [[Avvakum]] Petrov and many other opponents of the church reforms were burned at the stake, either forcibly or voluntarily. Another prominent figure within the Old Ritualists' movement, [[Feodosia Morozova|Boyarynya Morozova]], was starved to death in 1675. Others escaped from the government persecutions to [[Siberia]].\n\nSeveral years after the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav|Council of Pereyaslav]] (1654) that heralded the subsequent incorporation of eastern regions of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the see of the [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus']] was transferred to the Moscow Patriarchate (1686).\n\n===Peter the Great===\n{{Main|Church reform of Peter I}}\n\n[[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (1682\u20131725) had an agenda of radical modernization of Russian government, army, dress and manners. He made Russia a formidable political power. Peter was not religious and had a low regard for the Church, so he put it under tight governmental control. He replaced the Patriarch with a Holy Synod, which he controlled. The Tsar appointed all bishops.  A clerical career was not a route chosen by upper-class society. Most parish priests were sons of priests, were very poorly educated, and very poorly paid. The monks in the monasteries had a slightly higher status; they were not allowed to marry. Politically, the church was impotent.  Catherine the Great later in the 18th century seized most of the church lands, and put the priests on a small salary supplemented by fees for services such as baptism and marriage.<ref>Lindsey Hughes, ''Russia in the Age of Peter the Great'' (1998) pp.&nbsp;332\u201356.</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Russian Orthodox Church experienced a vast geographic expansion. Numerous financial and political incentives (as well as immunity from military service) were offered local political leaders who would convert to Orthodoxy, and bring their people with them.\n\nIn the following two centuries, missionary efforts stretched out across Siberia into [[History of Alaska|Alaska]]. Eminent people on that missionary effort included St. [[Innocent of Alaska|Innocent of Irkutsk]] and St. [[Herman of Alaska]].

This was the situation until shortly after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]], at which time the Local Council (more than half of its members being lay persons) adopted the decision to restore the Patriarchy. On November 5 (according to the Julian calendar) a new patriarch, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Tikhon]], was named through [[Sortition|casting lots]].\n\nThe late 18th century saw the rise of ''[[starets|starchestvo]]'' under [[Paisius Velichkovsky|Paisiy Velichkovsky]] and his disciples at the [[Optina Monastery]]. This marked a beginning of a significant spiritual revival in the Russian Church after a lengthy period of modernization, personified by such figures as [[Dimitry of Rostov|Demetrius of Rostov]] and [[Platon Levshin|Platon of Moscow]]. [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Ivan Kireevsky]] and other lay theologians with [[Slavophile]] leanings elaborated some key concepts of the renovated Orthodox doctrine, including that of ''[[sobornost]]''. The resurgence of Eastern Orthodoxy was reflected in Russian literature, an example is the figure of [[Starets]] [[Zosima]] in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov|Brothers Karamazov]]''.\n\n===Fin-de-si\u00e8cle religious renaissance===\n[[File:Russisch Orthodoxe Kirche Dresden.JPG|thumb|Russian Orthodox church in [[Dresden]], built in the 1870s]]\n\nDuring the final decades of the imperial order in Russia many educated Russians sought to return to the church and tried to bring their faith back to life. No less evident were non-conformist paths of spiritual searching known as \"God-Seeking\". Writers, artists and intellectuals in large numbers were drawn to private prayer, mysticism, [[spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]] and Eastern religions. A fascination with primitive feeling, with the unconscious and the mythic was apparent, along with visions of coming catastrophes and redemption.\n\nIn 1909, a volume of essays appeared under the title ''[[Vekhi]]'' (\"Milestones\" or \"Landmarks\"), authored by a group of leading left-wing intellectuals, including [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Peter Berngardovich Struve|Peter Struve]] and former [[Marxism|Marxists]]. They bluntly repudiated the materialism and atheism that had dominated the thought of the intelligentsia for generations as leading inevitably to failure and moral disaster. The essays created a sensation.\n\nIt is possible to see a similarly renewed vigor and variety in religious life and spirituality among the lower classes, especially after the upheavals of 1905. Among the peasantry there was widespread interest in spiritual-ethical literature and non-conformist moral-spiritual movements, an upsurge in pilgrimage and other devotions to sacred spaces and objects (especially icons), persistent beliefs in the presence and power of the supernatural (apparitions, possession, walking-dead, demons, spirits, miracles and magic), the renewed vitality of local \"ecclesial communities\" actively shaping their own ritual and spiritual lives, sometimes in the absence of clergy, and defining their own sacred places and forms of piety. Also apparent was the proliferation of what the Orthodox establishment branded as \"sectarianism\", including both non-Orthodox Christian denominations, notably [[Baptists]], and various forms of popular Orthodoxy and mysticism.<ref>A.

The council continued its sessions until September 1918 and adopted a number of important reforms, including the restoration of [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarchy]], a decision taken 3 days after the [[Bolshevik]]s [[October Revolution|overthrew the Provisional Government]] in Petrograd on 25 October (O.S.). On 5 November, Metropolitan [[Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow|Tikhon of Moscow]] was selected as the first Russian Patriarch after about 300 years of the Synodal rule.\n\nIn early February 1918, the Bolshevik-controlled government of Soviet Russia enacted the [[Decree on separation of church from state and school from church]] that proclaimed [[separation of church and state]] in Russia, freedom to \"profess any religion or profess none\", deprived religious organisations of the right to own any property and legal status. Legal religious activity in the territories controlled by Bolsheviks was effectively reduced to services and sermons inside church buildings. The Decree and attempts by Bolshevik officials to requisition church property caused sharp resentment on the part of the ROC clergy and provoked violent clashes on some occasions: on 1 February (19 January O.S.), hours after the bloody confrontation in Petrograd's [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]] between the Bolsheviks trying to take control of the monastery's premises and the believers, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]] issued a proclamation that [[anathema]]tised the perpetrators of such acts.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://st-elizabet.narod.ru/raznoe/anafema_sovetchikam.htm |title = \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0444\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0432. \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u0422\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u044b\u0432 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443 |access-date = 5 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe church was caught in the crossfire of the [[Russian Civil War]] that began later in 1918, and church leadership, despite their attempts to be politically neutral (from the autumn of 1918), as well as the clergy generally were perceived by the Soviet authorities as a \"counter-revolutionary\" force and thus subject to suppression and eventual liquidation.\n\nIn the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ostling |first = Richard |title = Cross meets Kremlin |work = [[TIME Magazine]] |date = June 24, 2001 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html }}</ref>\n\n===Under Soviet rule===\n{{See also|Religion in the Soviet Union|Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union}}\n\n[[File:Tikhon of Moscow.jpg|thumb|Patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]]]]\n\nThe Soviet Union, formally created in December 1922, was the first state to have elimination of religion as an ideological objective espoused by the country's ruling political party.

Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed.\n\nOrthodox clergy and active believers were treated by the Soviet law-enforcement apparatus as anti-revolutionary elements and were habitually subjected to formal prosecutions on political charges, arrests, exiles, [[Gulag|imprisonment in camps]], and later could also be incarcerated in [[Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|mental hospitals]].<ref>''Father Arseny 1893\u20131973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.''

It was impossible to build new churches. Practising Orthodox Christians were restricted from prominent careers and membership in communist organizations (the party, the [[Komsomol]]). Anti-religious propaganda was openly sponsored and encouraged by the government, which the Church was not given an opportunity to publicly respond to. The government youth organization, the [[Komsomol]], encouraged its members to vandalize Orthodox churches and harass worshippers. Seminaries were closed down, and the church was restricted from using the press. Theological schools were closed (until some were re-opened in the latter 1940s), and church publications were suppressed.\n\nHowever, the Soviet policy vis-a-vis organised religion vacillated over time between, on the one hand, a utopian determination to substitute secular rationalism for what they considered to be an outmoded \"superstitious\" worldview and, on the other, pragmatic acceptance of the tenaciousness of religious faith and institutions. In any case, religious beliefs and practices did persist, not only in the domestic and private spheres but also in the scattered public spaces allowed by a state that recognized its failure to eradicate religion and the political dangers of an unrelenting culture war.<ref>John Shelton Curtis, ''The Russian Church and the Soviet State'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1953); Jane Ellis, ''The Russian Orthodox Church: A Contemporary History'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986); Dimitry V.

In the time between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1935, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death. Many thousands of victims of persecution became recognized in a special canon of saints known as the \"[[New Martyr|new martyrs]] and confessors of Russia\".\n\nWhen Patriarch Tikhon died in 1925, the Soviet authorities forbade patriarchal election. Patriarchal ''locum tenens'' (acting Patriarch) [[Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow|Metropolitan Sergius]] (Stragorodsky, 1887\u20131944), going against the opinion of a major part of the church's parishes, in 1927 issued a declaration accepting the Soviet authority over the church as legitimate, pledging the church's cooperation with the government and condemning political dissent within the church. By this declaration Sergius granted himself authority that he, being a deputy of imprisoned [[Peter of Krutitsy|Metropolitan Peter]] and acting against his will, had no right to assume according to the XXXIV [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic canon]], which led to a split with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] abroad and the [[Russian True Orthodox Church]] (Russian Catacomb Church) within the Soviet Union, as they allegedly remained faithful to the Canons of the Apostles, declaring the part of the church led by Metropolitan Sergius [[schism (religion)|schism]], sometimes coined ''Sergianism''.

In 1930, after taking part in a prayer service in London in supplication for Christians suffering under the Soviets, Evlogy was removed from office by Sergius and replaced. Most of Evlogy's parishes in Western Europe remained loyal to him; Evlogy then petitioned Ecumenical Patriarch [[Photius II of Constantinople|Photius II]] to be received under his canonical care and was received in 1931, making a number of parishes of Russian Orthodox Christians outside Russia, especially in Western Europe an [[Exarchate]] of the Ecumenical Patriarchate as the [[Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe]].\n\n[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph taken of the 1931 demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow]]\n\nMoreover, in the [[1929 Soviet Union legislative election|1929 elections]], the Orthodox Church attempted to formulate itself as a full-scale opposition group to the Communist Party, and attempted to run candidates of its own against the Communist candidates.

The [[Slavic Greek Latin Academy|Moscow Theological Academy Seminary]], which had been closed since 1918, was re-opened.\n\nIn December 2017, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] lifted classified top secret status of documents revealing that the [[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKVD]] of the USSR and its units were engaged in the selection of candidates for participation in the [[1945 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|1945 Local Council]] from the representatives of the clergy and the laity. NKVD demanded \"to outline persons who have religious authority among the clergy and believers, and at the same time checked for civic or patriotic work\". In the letter sent in September 1944, it was emphasized: \"It is important to ensure that the number of nominated candidates is dominated by the agents of the NKBD, capable of holding the line that we need at the Council\".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://espreso.tv/news/2017/12/10/moskovskyy_patriarkhat_stvoryuvaly_agenty_nkvs_svidchat_rozskerecheni_sbu_dokumenty |title = \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u041d\u041a\u0412\u0421, \u2013 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0421\u0411\u0423 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 |website = espreso.tv }}</ref><ref>[https://www.znak.com/2017-12-10/sbu_rassekretila_arhivy_moskovskogo_patriarha_v_1945_godu_izbirali_agenty_nkgb \u0421\u0411\u0423 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432\u044b: \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u0432 1945 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u041d\u041a\u0413\u0411]</ref>\n\nBetween 1945 and 1959 the official organization of the church was greatly expanded, although individual members of the clergy were occasionally arrested and exiled. The number of open churches reached 25,000. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. This decline was evident from the dramatic decay of many of the abandoned churches and monasteries that were previously common in even the smallest villages from the pre-revolutionary period.\n\n====Persecution under Khrushchev====\nA new and widespread persecution of the church was subsequently instituted under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. A second round of repression, harassment and church closures took place between 1959 and 1964 when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was in office. The number of Orthodox churches fell from around 22,000 in 1959 to around 8,000 in 1965;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tsarist and Communist Russia 1855\u20131964|last=Sally|first=Waller|isbn=9780198354673|edition= Second |location=Oxford|oclc=913789474}}</ref> priests, monks and faithful were killed or imprisoned and the number of functioning monasteries was reduced to less than twenty.\n\nSubsequent to Khrushchev's overthrow, the Church and the government remained on unfriendly terms until 1988. In practice, the most important aspect of this conflict was that openly religious people could not join the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which meant that they could not hold any political office. However, among the general population, large numbers remained religious.\n\nSome Orthodox believers and even priests took part in the [[dissident]] movement and became [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]]. The Orthodox priests [[Gleb Yakunin]], Sergiy Zheludkov and others spent years in Soviet prisons and exile for their efforts in defending freedom of worship.<ref>\"Dissent in the Russian Orthodox Church,\" ''Russian Review'', Vol. 28, N 4, October 1969, pp. 416\u201327.</ref> Among the prominent figures of that time were Father Dmitri Dudko<ref name=\"Dudko\">\"Father Dmitri Dudko\".

Although he tried to keep away from practical work of the dissident movement intending to better fulfil his calling as a priest, there was a spiritual link between Fr Aleksandr and many of the dissidents. For some of them he was a friend; for others, a godfather; for many (including [[Yakunin]]), a spiritual father.<ref>''Keston Institute and the Defence of Persecuted Christians in the USSR''</ref>\n\nBy 1987 the number of functioning churches in the [[Soviet Union]] had fallen to 6,893 and the number of functioning monasteries to just 18. In 1987 in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], between 40% and 50% of newborn babies (depending on the region) were baptized. Over 60% of all deceased received Christian funeral services.\n\n==== Glasnost and evidence of KGB links ====\n{{Main|Glasnost}}\n\nBeginning  in the late 1980s, under Mikhail Gorbachev, the new political and social freedoms resulted in many church buildings being returned to the church, to be restored by local parishioners. A pivotal point in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church came in 1988, the millennial anniversary of the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Baptism of Kievan Rus']]. Throughout the summer of that year, major government-supported celebrations took place in Moscow and other cities; many older churches and some monasteries were reopened. An implicit ban on religious propaganda on state TV was finally lifted. For the first time in the history of the Soviet Union, people could see live transmissions of church services on television.\n\n[[Gleb Yakunin]], a critic of the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] who was one of those who briefly gained access to the [[KGB]] archive documents in the early 1990s, argued that the Moscow Patriarchate was \"practically a subsidiary, a sister company of the KGB\".<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119792074745834591?mod=hpp_us_inside_today Born Again.

The leaders of the Russian Church saw this action as a throwback to prior attempts by the Vatican to [[proselytism|proselytize]] the Russian Orthodox faithful to become Roman Catholic. This point of view was based upon the stance of the Russian Orthodox Church (and the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]]) that the Church of Rome is in schism, after breaking off from the Orthodox Church. The Roman Catholic Church, on the other hand, while acknowledging the primacy of the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia, believed that the small Roman Catholic minority in Russia, in continuous existence since at least the 18th century, should be served by a fully developed church hierarchy with a presence and status in Russia, just as the Russian Orthodox Church is present in other countries (including constructing a cathedral in Rome, near the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]).\n\nThere occurred strident conflicts with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, most notably over the Orthodox Church in [[Estonia]] in the mid-1990s, which resulted in [[1996 Moscow\u2013Constantinople schism|unilateral suspension of eucharistic relationship between the churches by the ROC]].<ref>\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u044f \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0445\u0443 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u044e I \u043e\u0442 23 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f 1996 // [[:ru:\u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0438|\u0416\u041c\u041f]] 1996, \u2116 3 (\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c).</ref> The tension lingered on and could be observed at the meeting in Ravenna in early October 2007 of participants in the Orthodox\u2013Catholic Dialogue: the representative of the Moscow Patriarchate, Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]], walked out of the meeting due to the presence of representatives from the [[Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church]] which is in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

of Moscow and all Rus']]]]\n\nThe ROC constituent parts in other than the Russian Federation countries of its exclusive jurisdiction such as Ukraine, Belarus et al., are legally registered as separate legal entities in accordance with the relevant legislation of those independent states.\n\nEcclesiastiacally, the ROC is organized in a hierarchical structure. The lowest level of organization, which normally would be a single ROC building and its attendees, headed by a priest who acts as Father superior ({{lang-ru|\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c}}, ''nastoyatel''), constitute a [[parish]] ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434}}, ''prihod''). All parishes in a geographical region belong to an [[eparchy]] ({{lang-ru|\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u044f}}\u2014equivalent to a Western [[diocese]]). Eparchies are governed by [[bishop]]s ({{lang-ru|\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f}}, [[Bishop|episcop]] or \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439, [[archiereus]]). There are 261 Russian Orthodox eparchies worldwide (June 2012).\n\nFurther, some eparchies may be organized into [[exarch]]ates (currently the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Belorussian exarchate]]), and since 2003 into metropolitan districts (\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433), such as the ROC eparchies in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]] (\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433).\n\n[[File:Blagoveschenskij sobor Pavlodar 001.JPG|thumb|Cathedral of the Annunciation in [[Pavlodar]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\nSince the early 1990s, the ROC eparchies in some newly independent states of the former USSR enjoy the status of [[self-governing]] Churches within the Moscow Patriarchate (which status, according to the ROC legal terminology, is distinct from the \u2033autonomous\u2033 one): the [[Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate]], [[Latvian Orthodox Church]], [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], the last one being virtually fully independent in administrative matters. Similar status, since 2007, is enjoyed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (previously fully independent and deemed schismatic by the ROC). The [[Chinese Orthodox Church]] and the [[Japanese Orthodox Church]]es were granted full autonomy by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this autonomy is not universally recognized.\n\nSmaller eparchies are usually governed by a single bishop. Larger eparchies, exarchates, and self-governing Churches are governed by a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan archbishop]] and sometimes also have one or more bishops assigned to them.\n\nThe highest level of authority in the ROC is vested in the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Local Council]] (''Pomestny Sobor''), which comprises all the bishops as well as representatives from the clergy and laypersons. Another organ of power is the [[Bishops' Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Bishops' Council]] (''\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440''). In the periods between the Councils the highest administrative powers are exercised by the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]], which includes seven permanent members and is chaired by the [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], Primate of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nAlthough the Patriarch of Moscow enjoys extensive administrative powers, unlike the [[Pope]], he has no direct canonical jurisdiction outside the [[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u044f|diocese of Moscow]], nor does he have single-handed authority over matters pertaining to faith as well as issues concerning the entire Orthodox Christian community such as the [[East\u2013West Schism|Catholic-Orthodox split]].\n\n===Orthodox Church in America (OCA)===\n{{main|Orthodox Church in America}}\nRussian traders settled in Alaska during the 18th century. In 1740, a Russian ship off the Alaskan coast recorded celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]]. In 1794, the Russian Orthodox Church sent missionaries\u2014among them [[Herman of Alaska]] (who was later canonized)\u2014to establish a formal mission in Alaska. Their missionary endeavors contributed to the conversion of many Alaskan natives to the Orthodox faith, especially after they learned the local languages and began to translate the liturgy into these. The ROC established a diocese, whose first bishop was [[Innocent of Alaska]] (also later canonized). Around the mid-19th century, the ROC moved this headquarters of the North American Diocese from Alaska to northern California.\n[[File:Alaska Russian Orthodox Church.jpg|thumb|right|Orthodox churches are common in [[Alaska]], particularly in the southern and southwest portions of the state, areas of Russian missionaries and settlement.]]\n[[File:OCA bishops in Saint Tikhon's Monastery and Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|Bishops of the Orthodox Church in America, at [[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary]]]]\n\nFollowing additional changes in population, the headquarters of the North American Diocese was moved in the late 19th century from California to [[New York City]], which had become a destination of numerous Greek and other Orthodox immigrants. At this time, many Greek Catholics shifted into the Orthodox Church in the East of the United States, increasing the numbers of Orthodox Christians in America. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThere had been a conflict between [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], the politically powerful Roman Catholic [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Saint Paul, Minnesota]]; and [[Alexis Toth]], an influential [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]] priest of St. Mary's church in Minneapolis. Because Archbishop Ireland refused to accept Fr. Toth's credentials as a priest, Fr Toth converted his parish of St. Mary's to the Orthodox Church. Under his guidance and inspiration, tens of thousands of other Greek Catholics in North America converted to the Orthodox Church. Ireland is sometimes honored as the \"Father of the [[Orthodox Church in America]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Such Greek Catholics were received into Orthodoxy into the existing North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church. \n\nAt the same time large numbers of Greek and other Orthodox Christians were also immigrating to America. All Orthodox Christians in North America were united under the ''[[omophorion]]'' (church authority and protection) of the Patriarch of Moscow, through the Russian Church's North American diocese. There was then no other Orthodox diocese on the continent. A Syro-Arab mission was established under the episcopal leadership of Fr. [[Raphael of Brooklyn]] (later canonized in the church), who was the first Orthodox bishop to be consecrated in the United States. \n\nIn 1920, after the Russian Revolution and establishment of the Soviet Union, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]] of Moscow issued an ''[[ukase]]'' (decree) that dioceses of the Church of Russia that were cut off from the governance of the highest Church authority should be managed independently until such time as normal relations could be resumed. Accordingly, the North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church (known as the \"Metropolia\") operated in a ''de facto'' autonomous mode of self-governance. The Russian Revolution resulted in financial hardship for the  North American diocese, as well as for the church in the Soviet Union. Other national Orthodox communities in North America tended to turn to the churches in their respective homelands for pastoral care and governance.\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin in the United States 13-16 November 2001-53.jpg|thumb|A commemoration service for the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] at St. Nicholas Cathedral in [[New York City]]]]\nA group of bishops who had left Russia as refugees in the wake of the [[Russian Civil War]], gathered in [[Sremski Karlovci|Sremski-Karlovci]]. This was traditionally known as the seat of [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] under the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1918, following the Great War, this city became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and, subsequently that year, of the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The bishops adopted a pro-monarchist stand. They claimed to speak as a synod for the entire \"free\" Russian church. This group was formally dissolved in 1922 by Patriarch Tikhon. He appointed metropolitans Platon and Evlogy as ruling bishops in the United States and Europe, respectively. Both of these metropolitans continued to entertain relations intermittently with the synod in Karlovci. Many of the Russian emigrants ignored Patriarch Tikhon's attempts to control the church outside Russia, believing that he was too subservient to the Soviets.\n\nBetween the world wars, the Metropolia coexisted and at times cooperated with an independent [[synod]], later known as the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (ROCOR), sometimes called the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. The two groups eventually operated independently. After World War II, ROCOR moved its headquarters to North America, following renewed Russian immigration especially to the United States. It claimed but failed to establish jurisdiction over all parishes of Russian origin in North America. The Metropolia, as a former diocese of the Russian Church, continued to consider the latter  as its highest church authority, although it was cut off under the conditions of the Communist regime in Russia.\n\nAfter World War II, the Patriarchate of Moscow made unsuccessful attempts to regain control over the groups abroad. After resuming communication with Moscow in early 1960s, and being granted [[autocephaly]] in 1970, the Metropolia became known as the [[Orthodox Church in America]].<ref>Very Rev.

The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] (under whom is the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]) and some other jurisdictions have not officially accepted it. The Ecumenical Patriarch and the other jurisdictions remain in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the OCA. The Patriarchate of Moscow thereby renounced its former canonical claims in the United States and Canada; it acknowledged an autonomous church also established in Japan in 1970.\n\n===Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR)===\n{{main|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}\nRussia's Church was devastated by the repercussions of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]]. One of its effects was a flood of refugees from Russia to the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Europe]]. The Revolution of 1918 severed large sections of the Russian church\u2014dioceses in America, Japan, and Manchuria, as well as refugees in Europe\u2014from regular contacts with the main church.\n\nBased on an ''[[ukase]]'' (decree) issued by [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]], Holy Synod and Supreme Council of the Church stated that ''dioceses'' of the Church of Russia that were cut off from the governance of the highest Church authority (i.e. the Holy Synod and the Patriarch) should be managed independently until such time as normal relations with the highest Church authority could be resumed, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was established; by bishops who had left Russia in the wake of the Russian Civil War. They first met in Constantinople, and then moved to Sremski-Karlovci, Yugoslavia. After World War II, they moved their headquarters to Munich, and 1950 to [[New York City]], New York, where it remains to this day.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, it was officially announced that the [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate|Act of Canonical Communion]] would finally be signed between the ROC and ROCOR. The signing took place on the May 17, 2007, followed immediately by a full restoration of [[full communion|communion]] with the Moscow Patriarchate, celebrated by a Divine Liturgy at the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], at which the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow|Alexius II]] and the First Hierarch of ROCOR concelebrated for the first time.\n\nUnder the Act, the ROCOR remains a self-governing entity within the Church of Russia. It is independent in its administrative, pastoral, and property matters. It continues to be governed by its Council of Bishops and its Synod, the Council's permanent executive body. The First-Hierarch and bishops of the ROCOR are elected by its Council and confirmed by the Patriarch of Moscow. ROCOR bishops participate in the Council of Bishops of the entire Russian Church.\n\nIn response to the signing of the act of canonical communion, Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Odessa and parishes and clergy in opposition to the Act broke communion with ROCOR, and established ROCA(A)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sinod.ruschurchabroad.org/engindex.htm |title=Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCA), Synod of Bishops |publisher=Sinod.ruschurchabroad.org |date=|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> Some others opposed to the Act have joined themselves to other [[Greek Old Calendarists|Greek Old Calendarist]] groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/eng2007/7ensfcommunique.html|title=The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia \u2013 Official Website|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016172842/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/eng2007/7ensfcommunique.html|archivedate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nCurrently both the OCA and ROCOR, since 2007, are in communion with the ROC.\n\n=== Self-governing branches of the ROC ===\n[[File:Foros in 02.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Foros Church|Church of the Resurrection of Christ]], near [[Yalta]], [[Crimea]].]]\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has four levels of self-government.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141219144758/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/12/19/7052645/ Belarusian Orthodox Church wants autonomy from Moscow].

Such rights belong to the ruling hierarch and it can only happen when the blessing of the patriarch is received. The task of believers of the local eparchy is to record descriptions of miracles, to create the hagiography of a saint, to paint an icon, as well as to compose a liturgical text of a service where the saint is canonized. All of this is sent to the Synodal Commission for canonization which decides whether to canonize the local hero of faith or not. Then the patriarch gives his blessing and the local hierarch performs the act of canonization at the local level. However, the liturgical texts in honor of a saint are not published in all Church books but only in local publications. In the same way these saints are not yet canonized and venerated by the whole Church, only locally. When the glorification of a saint exceeds the limits of an eparchy, then the patriarch and Holy Synod decides about their canonization on the Church level. After receiving the Synod's support and the patriarch's blessing, the question of glorification of a particular saint on the scale of the entire Church is given for consideration to the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the period following the revolution, and during the communist persecutions up to 1970, no canonizations took place. Only in 1970 did the Holy Synod made a decision to canonize a missionary to Japan, Nicholas Kasatkin (1836\u20131912). In 1977, St. Innocent of Moscow (1797\u20131879), the Metropolitan of Siberia, the Far East, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and Moscow was also canonized. In 1978 it was proclaimed that the Russian Orthodox Church had created a prayer order for Meletius of Kharkov, which practically signified his canonization because that was the only possible way to do it at that time. Similarly, the saints of other Orthodox Churches were added to the Church calendar: in 1962 St. John the Russian, in 1970 St. Herman of Alaska, in 1993 [[Silouan the Athonite]], the elder of Mount Athos, already canonized in 1987 by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. In the 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church re-established the process for canonization; a practice that had ceased for half a century.\n\nIn 1989, the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church|Holy Synod]] established the Synodal Commission for canonization. The [[1990 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]] gave an order for the Synodal Commission for Canonisation to prepare documents for canonization of new martyrs who had suffered from the 20th century Communist repressions. In 1991 it was decided that a local commission for canonization would be established in every eparchy which would gather the local documents and would send them to the Synodal Commission. Its task was to study the local archives, collect memories of believers, record all the miracles that are connected with addressing the martyrs. In 1992 the Church established 25 January as a day when it venerates the new 20th century martyrs of faith. The day was specifically chosen because on this day in 1918 the Metropolitan of Kiev Vladimir (Bogoyavlensky) was killed, thus becoming the first victim of communist terror among the hierarchs of the Church.\n\nDuring the 2000 Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, the greatest general canonization in the history of the Orthodox Church took place: not only regarding the number of saints but also as in this canonization, all unknown saints were mentioned. There were 1,765 canonized saints known by name and others unknown by name but \"known to God\".\n\n===Icon painting===\n{{main|Russian icons}}\n[[File:Andrej Rubl\u00ebv 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrei Rublev]] [[Trinity]] c. 1400 ]]\nThe use and making of [[icon]]s entered [[Kievan Rus']] following [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|its conversion]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in AD 988. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by [[Byzantine art]], led from the capital in [[Constantinople]]. As time passed, the Russians widened the vocabulary of types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere in the Orthodox world. Russian icons are typically [[Panel painting|paintings on wood]], often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be much larger. Some Russian icons were made of copper.<ref>Ahlborn, Richard E. and Vera Beaver-Bricken Espinola, eds. Russian Copper Icons and Crosses From the Kunz Collection: Castings of Faith. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press. 1991. 85 pages with illustrations, some colored. Includes bibliographical references pp. 84\u201385. Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology: No. 51.</ref> Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner. There is a rich history and elaborate religious symbolism associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an [[iconostasis]] (Russian ''ikonostas'', \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0441), or icon-screen, a wall of icons with double doors in the centre. Russians sometimes speak of an icon as having been \"written\", because in the Russian language (like Greek, but unlike English) the same word (''pisat''', \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c in Russian) means both to paint and to write. Icons are considered to be the Gospel in paint, and therefore careful attention is paid to ensure that the Gospel is faithfully and accurately conveyed. Icons considered miraculous were [[Acheiropoieta|said to \"appear.\"]] The \"appearance\" (Russian: ''yavlenie'', \u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) of an icon is its supposedly miraculous discovery. \"A true icon is one that has 'appeared', a gift from above, one opening the way to the Prototype and able to perform miracles\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Russian Icons |author=Father Vladimir Ivanov |publisher=Rizzoli Publications |year=1988}}</ref>\n\n===Bell ringing===\n{{main|Russian Orthodox bell ringing}}\n{{Expand section|[[Russian Orthodox bell ringing]]|date=December 2015}}\nBell ringing, which has a history in the Russian Orthodox tradition dating back to the [[baptism of Rus']], plays an important part in the traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n==Ecumenism and interfaith relations==\n[[File:Church of Mary Magdalene3.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Mary Magdalene]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]\nIn May 2011, [[Hilarion Alfeyev]], the Metropolitan of Volokolamsk and head of [[external relations for the Moscow Patriarchate]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, stated that Orthodox and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christians share the same positions on \"such issues as [[pro-life|abortion]], the [[Family values#Conservative definitions|family]], and [[Christian views on marriage|marriage]]\" and desire \"vigorous grassroots engagement\" between the two [[Communion (Christian)|Christian communions]] on such issues.<ref name=\"Communions\">{{cite magazine|url= http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/may/fromrussialove.html?start=1|title=From Russia, with Love|quote=Many evangelicals share conservative positions with us on such issues as abortion, the family, and marriage.
