After the post-[[Meiji restoration]] establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the area became part of [[Kitatsugaru District, Aomori]], and was divided into the villages of Goshogawara, Sakae, Miyoshi, Nakagawa, Nagahashi, Nanawa, Matsushima and Itayanagi in 1889. On July 1, 1898, Goshogawara was elevated to town status. On October 1, 1954. Goshogawara absorbed the villages of Sakae, Nakagawa, Nagahashi, Matsushima and Iizume to create the city of Goshogawara. On April 1, 1958, Goshogawara absorbed a portion of the town of Kizukuri.\n\nOn March 28, 2005, the town of [[Kanagi, Aomori|Kanagi]], and the village of [[Shiura, Aomori|Shiura]] were [[Merger and dissolution of municipalities of Japan|merged]] into Goshogawara.\n\n==Government==\nGoshogawara has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 26 members.

From 1437 to 1848 political power in Transylvania was shared among the mostly [[Hungarian nobility]], German [[bourgeoisie|burghers]] and the [[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]] of the [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] (a Hungarian ethnic group). The population consisted of [[Romanians]], [[Hungarians]] (particularly Sz\u00e9kelys) and [[Germans]]. The majority of the present population is Romanian, but large minorities (mainly Hungarian and [[Romani people|Roma]]) preserve their traditions. However, as recently as the [[Communist Romania|communist era]] [[ethnic minority|ethnic-minority]] relations remained an issue of international contention. This has abated (but not disappeared) since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of 1989]] restored democracy in Romania. Transylvania retains a significant [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-speaking]] minority, slightly less than half of which identify themselves as Sz\u00e9kely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recensamant.ro/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424065630/http://www.recensamant.ro/ |archivedate=April 24, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Transylvanian Saxons|Ethnic Germans in Transylvania]] (known as Saxons) comprise about one percent of the population; however, Austrian and German influences remain in the architecture and urban landscape of much of Transylvania.\n\nThe region's history may be traced through the religions of its inhabitants.

Under [[Burebista]], the foremost king of Dacia and a contemporary of [[Julius Caesar]], the kingdom reached its maximum extent. The area now constituting Transylvania was the political center of Dacia.\n\nThe Dacians are often mentioned by [[Augustus]], according to whom they were compelled to recognize [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] supremacy. However, they were not subdued and in later times crossed the frozen [[Danube]] during winter and ravaging Roman cities in the recently acquired [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]].\n\nThe Dacians built several important [[Dacian cities|fortified cities]], among them [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] (near the present [[Hunedoara]]). They were divided into [[Comati|two classes]]: the aristocracy (''tarabostes'') and the common people (''comati'').\n\n=== The Roman-Dacian Wars ===\n{{Main|Decebalus|Domitian's Dacian War|Trajan's Dacian Wars|Battle of Sarmizegetusa|}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|[[Roman Dacia]]|alt=Green, purple, yellow and orange map]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] expansion in the [[Balkans]] brought the Dacians into open conflict with Rome. During the reign of [[Decebalus]], the Dacians were engaged in [[Domitian's Dacian War|several wars with the Romans]] from 85 to 89 CE. After two reverses the Romans gained an advantage but were obliged to make peace due to the defeat of [[Domitian]] by the [[Marcomanni]]. Domitian agreed to pay large sums (eight million [[sesterces]]) in annual tribute to the Dacians for maintaining peace.\n\n[[File:Comati dacians romanian government picture.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Population of Dacia represented on Trajan's Column|alt=Cross section of Dacian society]]\n\nIn 101 the emperor [[Trajan]] began a [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|military campaign]] against the [[Dacians]], which included a [[siege]] of Sarmizegetusa Regia and the occupation of part of the country. The Romans prevailed but Decebalus was left as a [[client king]] under a Roman [[protectorate]]. Three years later, the Dacians rebelled and destroyed the Roman troops in Dacia. As a result, Trajan quickly began a new campaign against them (105\u2013106). The [[Battle of Sarmizegetusa|battle for Sarmizegetusa Regia]] took place in the early summer of 106 with the participation of the [[Legio II Adiutrix|II Adiutrix]] and [[Legio IV Flavia Felix|IV Flavia Felix]] legions and a detachment (''vexillatio'') from the [[Legio VI Ferrata]]. The Dacians repelled the first attack, but the water pipes from the Dacian capital were destroyed. The city was set on fire, the pillars of the sacred sanctuaries were cut down and the fortification system was destroyed; however, the war continued. Through the treason of Bacilis (a confidant of the Dacian king), the Romans found [[Decebalus' treasure]] in the [[Strei River]] (estimated by [[Jerome Carcopino]] as 165,500&nbsp;kg of gold and 331,000&nbsp;kg of silver). The last battle with the army of the Dacian king took place at [[Porolissum]] (Moigrad).\n\nDacian culture encouraged its soldiers to not fear death, and it was said that they left for war merrier than for any other journey. In his retreat to the mountains, Decebalus was followed by [[Roman cavalry]] led by [[Tiberius Claudius Maximus]]. The Dacian religion of [[Zalmoxis]] permitted suicide as a last resort by those in pain and misery, and the Dacians who heard Decebalus' last speech dispersed and committed suicide. Only the king tried to retreat from the Romans, hoping that he could find in the mountains and forests the means to resume battle, but the Roman cavalry followed him closely. After they almost caught him, Decebalus committed suicide by slashing his throat with his sword ([[Dacian falx|falx]]).\n\nThe history of the Dacian Wars was written by [[Cassius Dio]], and they are also depicted on [[Trajan's Column]] in [[Rome]].\n\nFollowing the war, several parts of Dacia including Transylvania were organized into the Roman province of [[Dacia Trajana|Dacia Traiana]].\n\n{{anchor|Late antiquity: after the Roman province Dacia}}\n=== Roman Dacia ===\n{{Main|||||Roman Dacia}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:DonariumBiertan.JPG|thumb|The [[Biertan Donarium]], an early Christian votive object of the early fourth century.

He was, according to the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', a ''voivod'' from Bundyn ([[Vidin]]) who ruled the territory of [[Banat]] in the Vidin region of southern Transylvania. Glad was said to have authority over the [[Slav]]s and [[Vlach]]s. The Hungarians sent an army against him, subduing the population between the ''Morisio'' ([[Mure\u0219 river|Mure\u0219]]) and ''Temes'' ([[Timi\u0219 River|Timi\u0219]]) rivers. When they tried to cross the Timi\u0219, Glad attacked them with an army which included Cuman, Bulgarian and Vlach support. The next day, Glad was defeated by the Hungarians. Hungarian historiography regards him as fictitious, along with many other imaginary characters in the Gesta. Romanian historiography, on the other hand, identifies him as a real person and places the Hungarian attack against Glad into 934. His name might come from the same Hungarian word, meaning \"perfidious, mean, atrocious\".\n\n[[Ahtum|Ahtum or Ajtony]] was a local duke in Banat, and the last ruler who resisted the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary, in the early 11th century. He taxed salt on the Maros (Mure\u015f) carried to King [[Stephen I of Hungary]] on the river. Ajtony's commander-in-chief was [[Csan\u00e1d]], and the king placed the latter at the head of a royal attack. Ajtony was defeated by the army of Stephen I of Hungary, with his stronghold being renamed Csan\u00e1d afterwards. Ahtum's ethnicity (and that of his people) is controversial; his name is thought to translate \"gold\" in [[Old Turkic]].\n\n[[Menumorut]] is described by Anonymus as duke of the [[Khazars]] between the River Tisza and the Ygfon Forest near Ultrasilvania (Transylvania), from the Mure\u0219 to the [[Some\u0219 River]]s. According to the deeds in ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'', he declined the 907 request of the Magyar ruler \u00c1rp\u00e1d to surrender his territory between the Some\u0219 and the Meses Mountains. In negotiations with ambassadors Usubuu and Veluc from \u00c1rp\u00e1d he invoked the sovereignty of the Byzantine emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]]:\n\n{{quote|The ambassadors of \u00c1rp\u00e1d crossed the Tisza and came to the capital fortress of [[Biharia]], demanding important territories on the left bank of the river for their duke.

Ourself on the other hand, neither out of love nor out of fear, we will ever concede him land, not even if spanning only a finger, although he said he has a right on it.

Before then, the word ''isp\u00e1n'' was used for the chief official of [[Alba County]]. Transylvania came under ''voivod'' rule after 1263, when the duties of the Counts of Szolnok (Doboka) and Alba were eliminated. The voivod controlled seven ''[[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|comitatus]]''. According to the ''Chronica Pictum'' Transylvania's first voivod was Zolt\u00e1n Erdoelue, a relative of King Stephen.\n\nThe three most important 14th-century dignitaries were the voivod, the Bishop of Transylvania and the Abbot of Kolozsmonostor (on the outskirts of present-day Cluj-Napoca). Transylvania was organized according to the [[Estate of the realm|estate]] system. Its estates were privileged groups, or ''universitates'' (the central power acknowledged some collective freedoms), with socio-economic and political power; they were also organized using ethnic criteria.\n\nAs in the rest of the Hungarian kingdom, the first estate was the aristocracy (lay and ecclesiastic): ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing homogenization around its Hungarian nucleus. The document granting privileges to the aristocracy was the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], issued by King Andrew II. The other estates were the Saxons, Szeklers and Romanians, all with an ethno-linguistic basis. The Saxons, who had settled in southern Transylvania in the 12th and 13th centuries, were granted privileges in 1224 by the [[Diploma Andreanum]]. The Szeklers and Romanians were granted partial privileges. While the Szeklers consolidated their privileges, extending them to the entire ethnic group, the Romanians had difficulty retaining their privileges in certain areas (''terrae Vlachorum or districtus Valachicales'') and lost their estate rank. Nevertheless, when the king (or the voivod) summoned the general assembly of Transylvania (''congregatio'') during the 13th and 14th centuries it was attended by the four estates: noblemen, Saxons, Szeklers and Romanians (''Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis in partibus Transiluanis'').\n\n===={{anchor|Transylvania as part of the Kingdom of Hungary: later Middle Ages}}Later Middle Ages====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Transylvania16cent adm div.PNG|thumb|left|Administrative divisions of Transylvania, early 16th century|alt=Green, yellow and grey map]]\n\nAfter 1366, Romanians gradually lost their estate status (''[[Universitas Valachorum]]'') and were excluded from Transylvanian assemblies. The primary reason was religious; during Louis I's proselytization campaign, privileged status was deemed incompatible with [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in a state endowed with an \"apostolic mission\" by the Holy See. In his 1366 [[Decree of Turda]] the king redefined nobility as membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], thus excluding the [[Eastern Orthodox]], \"schismatic\" Romanians. After 1366, nobility was determined not only by ownership of land and people but also by the possession of a royal donation certificate. Since the Romanian social elite\u2014chiefly made up of aldermen (''iudices'') or ''knezes'' (''kenezii''), who ruled their villages according to the law of the land (''ius valachicum'')\u2014managed only somewhat to obtain writs of donation and were expropriated. Lacking property or an official status as owner and excluded from privileges as schismatics, the Romanian elite could no longer form an estate and participate in the country's assemblies.\n\nIn 1437 Hungarian and Romanian peasants, the [[petty nobility]] and burghers from Kolozsv\u00e1r (Klausenburg, now [[Cluj]]), under [[Antal Nagy de Buda]], [[Budai Nagy Antal Revolt|rose against their feudal masters]] and proclaimed their own estate (''universitas hungarorum et valachorum'', \"the estate of Hungarians and Romanians\"). To suppress the revolt the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, the Saxon burghers and the Sz\u00e9kelys formed the [[Unio Trium Nationum]] (Union of the Three Nations): a mutual-aid alliance against the peasants, pledging to defend their privileges against any power except that of Hungary's king. By 1438, the rebellion was crushed. From 1438 onwards the political system was based on the [[Unio Trium Nationum]], and society was regulated by these three estates: the nobility (mostly Hungarians), the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] and Saxon burghers. These estates, however, were more social and religious than ethnic divisions. Directed against the peasants, the Union limited the number of estates (excluding the Orthodox from political and social life in Transylvania): \"The privileges define the status of the three recognized nations - the Hungarians, the Siculi and the Saxons - and the four churches - Lutheran, Calvinist, Unitarian and Catholic. The exclusion concerns the Romanian community and its Orthodox Church, a community that accounts for at least 50% of the population in the mid-eighteenth century.\"<ref>''\"Les privil\u00e8ges d\u00e9finissent le statut des trois nations reconnues \u2013 les Hongrois, les Sicules et les Saxons \u2013 et des quatres Eglises \u2013 luth\u00e9rienne, calvinistes, unitarienne et catholique.

Unlike [[History of Maramure\u0219|Maramure\u0219]], after the Decree of Turda in Transylvania the only way to remain (or become) nobility was conversion to Roman Catholicism. To preserve their positions, some Romanian families converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and were Magyarized (such as the Hunyadi/Corvinus, Bed\u0151h\u00e1zi, Bilkei, Ilosvai, Dr\u00e1gffy, D\u00e1nfi, R\u00e9k\u00e1si, Dobozi, Mutnoki, D\u00e9si and Majl\u00e1th families). Some reached the highest ranks of society; [[Nicolaus Olahus]] became Archbishop of Esztergom, [[John Hunyadi]], a great military commander, governor and regent of Hungary, while the John Hunyadi's son [[Matthias Corvinus]] became king of Hungary.\n\nNevertheless, since the majority of Romanians did not convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] there was nowhere for them to be politically represented until the 19th century. They were deprived of their rights and subject to segregation (such as not being allowed to live in or purchase houses in the cities, build stone churches or receive justice. Several examples of legal decisions by the three nations a century after Unio Trium Nationum (1542\u20131555) are indicative. The Romanian could not appeal for justice against Hungarians and Saxons, but the latter could turn in the Romanian (1552); the Hungarian (''Hungarus'') accused of robbery could be defended by the oath of the village judge and three honest men, while the Romanian (''Valachus'') needed the oath of the village ''knez'', four Romanians and three Hungarians (1542); the Hungarian peasant could be punished after being accused by seven trustworthy people, while the Romanian was punished after accusations by only three (1554).\n\nAfter a diversionary manoeuvre led by Sultan Murad II it was clear that the goal of the Ottomans was not to consolidate their grip on the Balkans and intimidate the Hungarians, but to conquer Hungary. A key figure in Transylvania at this time was [[John Hunyadi]] (c. 1387 or 1400\u20131456). Hunyadi was awarded a number of estates (becoming one of the foremost landowners in Hungarian history) and a seat on the royal council for his service to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]]. After supporting the candidature of [[Ladislaus III of Poland]] for the Hungarian throne, he was rewarded in 1440 with the captaincy of the fortress of N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ([[Belgrade]]) and the [[voivodship]] of Transylvania (with his fellow voivod Miklos \u00dajlaki). His subsequent military exploits (he is considered one of the foremost generals of the Middle Ages) against the [[Ottoman Empire]] brought him further status as the [[regent]] of [[Hungary]] in 1446 and papal recognition as the Prince of Transylvania in 1448.\n\n==Modern era==\n=== {{anchor|Early Modern Era: Transylvania as an autonomous principality}}Early autonomous principality ===\n{{Main|Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Treaty of Speyer (1570)|Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)}}\n\nWhen the main Hungarian army and King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiello]] were slain by the Ottomans in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], [[John Z\u00e1polya]]\u2014voivod of Transylvania, who opposed the succession of Ferdinand of Austria (later [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]]) to the Hungarian throne\u2014took advantage of his military strength.

It was now beyond the reach of Catholic religious authority, allowing [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] preaching to flourish. In 1563 [[Giorgio Blandrata]] was appointed court physician; his radical religious ideas influenced young King John II and Calvinist bishop [[Francis David]], eventually converting both to [[Unitarianism]]. Francis David prevailed over Calvinist [[Peter Melius]] in 1568 in a public debate, resulting in individual freedom of religious expression under the [[Edict of Turda]] (the first such legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe). Lutherans, Calvinists, Unitarians and Roman Catholics received protection, while the majority [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was tolerated.\n\nTransylvania was governed by princes and its [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] (parliament). The [[Transylvanian Diet]] consisted of three estates: the Hungarian elite (largely ethnic [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[nobility]] and [[clergy]]), Saxon leaders (German burghers) and the free [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely Hungarians]].\n\n[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|The three principalities under [[Michael the Brave]]|alt=Orange, green and yellow map of 1600 holdings]]\n\nThe B\u00e1thory family, which assumed power at the death of John II in 1571, ruled Transylvania as princes under the Ottomans (and briefly under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] suzerainty) until 1602. The younger Stephen B\u00e1thory, a Hungarian Catholic who later became King Stephen B\u00e1thory of [[Poland]], tried to maintain the religious liberty granted by the Edict of Turda but interpreted this obligation in an increasingly restricted sense. Under [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Transylvania entered the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]], which began as a Christian alliance against the Turks and became a four-sided conflict in Transylvania involving the Transylvanians, [[Habsburg]]s, Ottomans and the Romanian voivod of [[Wallachia]] led by [[Michael the Brave]].\n\nMichael gained control of Transylvania (supported by the [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Szeklers]]) in October 1599 after the [[Battle of \u0218elimb\u0103r]], in which he defeated [[Andrew B\u00e1thory]]'s army. B\u00e1thory was killed by Szeklers who hoped to regain their old privileges with Michael's help. In May 1600 Michael gained control of [[Moldavia]], thus he became the leader of the three principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania (the three major regions of modern Romania). Michael installed Wallachian boyars in certain offices but did not interfere with the estates and sought support from the Hungarian nobility. In 1600 he was defeated by [[Giorgio Basta]] (Captain of [[Upper Hungary]]) and lost his Moldavian holdings to the Poles. After presenting his case to [[Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]] (capital of Germany), Michael was rewarded for his service.<ref>{{cite web|author=Miron Costin |url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002975CP0 |title=Grausame Zeiten in der Moldau.

Basta subdued Transylvania in 1604, initiating a reign of terror in which he was authorised to appropriate land belonging to noblemen, [[Germanization|Germanize]] the population and reclaim the principality for Catholicism in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. The period between 1601 (the assassination of Michael the Brave) and 1604 (the fall of Basta) was the most difficult for Transylvania since the Mongol invasion. ''\"Misericordia dei quod non-consumti sumus\"'' (\"only God's mercy saves us from annihilation\") characterised this period, according to an anonymous Saxon writer.\n\n[[File:Transylvanian Principality.svg|thumb|Principality of Transylvania, 1606\u20131660|alt=Multicolored map, depicting rivers]]\n\nFrom 1604 to 1606, the [[Calvinist]] Bihar magnate [[Istv\u00e1n Bocskay]] led a successful rebellion against Habsburg rule. Bocskay was elected Prince of Transylvania April 5, 1603, and Prince of Hungary two months later. The two major achievements of Bocskay's brief reign (he died December 29, 1606) were the [[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]] (June 23, 1606) and the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] (November 1606). With the Peace of Vienna Bocskay obtained religious liberty, the restoration of all confiscated estates, repeal of all \"unrighteous\" judgments, full retroactive amnesty for all Hungarians in [[Royal Hungary]] and recognition as independent sovereign prince of an enlarged Transylvania. Almost-equally important was the twenty-year Peace of Zsitvatorok, negotiated by Bocskay between Sultan [[Ahmed I]] and Rudolf II.\n\nGabriel Bethlen (who reigned from 1613 to 1629) thwarted all efforts of the emperor to oppress (or circumvent) his subjects, and won a reputation abroad by championing the Protestant cause. He waged war on the emperor three times, was proclaimed [[King of Hungary]] twice and obtained a confirmation of the Treaty of Vienna for the Protestants (and seven additional counties in northern Hungary for himself) in the [[Peace of Nikolsburg]] signed December 31, 1621. Bethlen's successor, George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, was equally successful. His principal achievement was the Peace of [[Linz]] (September 16, 1645), the last political triumph of Hungarian Protestantism, in which the emperor was forced to reconfirm the articles of the Peace of Vienna. Gabriel Bethlen and George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi aided education and culture, and their reign has been called the golden era of Transylvania.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} They lavished money on their capital [[Alba Iulia]] (''Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r'' or ''Wei\u00dfenburg''), which became the main bulwark of Protestantism in [[Central Europe]]. During their reign, Transylvania was one of the few European countries where Roman Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans and Unitarians lived in mutual tolerance\u2014all officially accepted religions (''religiones recaepte''). The Orthodox, however, still had inferior status.\n\nThis golden age (and relative independence) of Transylvania ended with the reign of [[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]. The prince, coveting the Polish crown, allied with Sweden and invaded [[Poland]] in 1657 despite the [[Ottoman Porte]]'s prohibition of military action. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was defeated in Poland and his army taken hostage by the Tatars. Chaotic years followed, with a quick succession of princes fighting one another and R\u00e1k\u00f3czi unwilling to resign, despite the Turkish threat of military attack. To resolve the political situation, the Turks resorted to military might; invasions of Transylvania with their Crimean Tatar allies, the ensuing loss of territory (particularly their primary Transylvanian stronghold, [[V\u00e1rad]], in 1660) and diminished manpower led to [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|Prince John Kem\u00e9ny]] proclaiming the secession of Transylvania from the Ottomans in April 1661 and appealing for help to Vienna. A secret Habsburg-Ottoman agreement, however, prevented the Habsburgs from intervening; Kem\u00e9ny's defeat by the Turks (and the Turkish installation of the weak [[Mih\u00e1ly Apafi]] on the throne) marked the subordination of Transylvania, now a [[client state]] of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n<gallery heights=200 mode=packed>\nFile:Kober Stephen Bathory.jpg|alt=Bearded man, standing in red cloak|[[Stephen B\u00e1thory]], who was elected King of Poland\nFile:Michael-of-walachia.jpg|alt=Bearded man with mustache, wearing large round hat with feather|[[Michael the Brave]], Lord of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania\nFile:Nte-kir-bocskai.jpg|alt=Statue of bearded man with hat, holding a scepter|Prince [[Stephen Bocskay]]\nFile:Gabriel Bethlen.jpg|alt=Ornate drawing of bearded man holding a scepter|Prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]]\nFile:I.r\u00e1k\u00f3czi gy\u00f6rgy.jpg|alt=Drawing of bearded man wearing an ornate hat|[[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], Prince of Transylvania\n</gallery>\n\n=== {{anchor|Modern Era: Habsburg rule}}Habsburg rule ===\n{{Main|Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an}}\n{{See also|Early Modern Romania|Early Modern Moldavia|Early Modern Wallachia}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Closca.jpg|thumb|Public execution of [[Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an|Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an]]|alt=Drawing of well-attended execution]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, the Habsburgs began to impose their rule on Transylvania. In addition to strengthening the central government and administration, they promoted the Roman Catholic Church as a uniting force and to weaken the influence of Protestant nobility. By creating a conflict between Protestants and Catholics, the Habsburgs hoped to weaken the estates. They also attempted to persuade Orthodox clergymen to join the [[Uniate]] (Greek Catholic) Church, which accepted four key points of Catholic doctrine and acknowledged papal authority while retaining Orthodox rituals and traditions. [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] decreed Transylvania's [[Orthodox Church]] in union with the Roman Catholic Church by joining the newly created [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]]. Some priests converted, although the similarity between the two denominations was unclear to many. In response to the Habsburg policy of converting all Romanian Orthodox to Greek-Catholics, several peaceful movements within the Romanian Orthodox population advocated freedom of worship for all Transylvanians; notable leaders were Visarion Sarai, Nicolae Oprea Micl\u0103u\u0219 and [[Sofronie of Cioara]].\n\nFrom 1711 onward, Habsburg control over Transylvania was consolidated and Transylvanian princes were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Grand+Principality+of+Transylvania |title=Grand Principality of Transylvania &#124; Article about Grand Principality of Transylvania by The Free Dictionary |website=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref> In 1765 the [[Grand Principality of Transylvania]] was proclaimed, consolidating the separate status of Transylvania within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] established by the 1691 Diploma Leopoldinum.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=Leopoldinum/> Hungarian historiography sees this as a formality.<ref>{{cite web |title=JOHN HUNYADI: Hungary in American History Textbooks |url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/hunyadi/hu03.htm |work=Andrew L.

They fought at [[C\u00e2mpeni|Top\u00e1nfalva (Topesdorf/C\u00e2mpeni)]], Abrudb\u00e1nya (Gro\u00dfschlatten/Abrud) and Verespatak (Goldbach/Ro\u0219ia), defeating the Habsburg Imperial Army at Br\u00e1d (Tannenhof/Brad) on November 27, 1784. The revolt was crushed on February 28, 1785, at Dealul Furcilor (Forks Hill), Alba-Iulia, when the leaders were apprehended. Horea and Clo\u0219ca were executed by [[breaking on the wheel]]; Cri\u0219an hanged himself the night before his execution.\n\nIn 1791 the Romanians petitioned [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]] for religious equality and recognition as a fourth \"nation\" in Transylvania ([[Supplex Libellus Valachorum]]). The Transylvanian Diet rejected their demands, restoring the Romanians to their marginalised status.\n\nIn early 1848, the Hungarian Diet took the opportunity presented by [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution]] to enact a comprehensive program of legislative reform (the [[April laws]]), which included a provision for the union of Transylvania and Hungary. Transylvanian Romanians initially welcomed the revolution, believing they would benefit from the reforms. However, their position changed due to the opposition of Transylvanian nobles to reform (such as emancipation of the serfs) and the failure of Hungarian revolutionary leaders to recognise Romanian national interests. In mid-May a Romanian diet at [[Blaj|Bal\u00e1zsfalva]] produced its own revolutionary program, calling for proportional representation of Romanians in the [[Transylvanian Diet]] and an end to social and ethnic oppression. The Saxons were concerned about union with Hungary, fearing the loss of their traditional privileges. When the Transylvanian Diet met on May 29, the vote for union was pushed through despite objections from many Saxon deputies. On June 10, the Emperor sanctioned the union vote of the Diet. Military executions and the arrest of revolutionary leaders after the union hardened the Saxons' position. In September 1848, another Romanian assembly in Bal\u00e1zsfalva (Blaj) denounced the union with Hungary and called for an armed uprising in Transylvania. War broke out in November, with Romanian and Saxon troops (under Austrian command) battling Hungarians led by Polish general [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]. Within four months, Bem had ousted the Austrians from Transylvania. However, in June 1849 Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] responded to an appeal from Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] to send Russian troops into Transylvania. After initial successes against the Russians, Bem's army was defeated decisively at the Battle of Temesv\u00e1r ([[Timi\u0219oara]]) on August 9; the surrender of Hungary followed.\n\n[[File:J\u00f3zef Bem 111.JPG|thumb|[[J\u00f3zef Bem]]]]\n\nThe Austrians clearly rejected the October demand that ethnic criteria become the basis for internal borders, with the goal of creating a province for Romanians (Transylvania, alongside [[Banat]] and [[Bukovina]]); they did not want to replace the threat of Hungarian nationalism with a potential one of Romanian [[separatism]]. However, they did not declare themselves hostile to the creation of Romanian administrative offices in Transylvania (which prevented Hungary from including the region in all but name). The territory was organized into ''prefecturi'' (prefectures), with Avram Iancu and Buteanu two prefects in the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. Iancu's prefecture, the ''Auraria Gemina'' (a name charged with [[Latin]] symbolism), became important; it took over from bordering areas which were never fully organized.\n\nAdministrative efforts were then halted as Hungarians, under J\u00f3zef Bem, carried out an offensive through Transylvania. With the covert assistance of [[Imperial Russia]]n troops, the Austrian army (except for garrisons at [[Alba Iulia|Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] and [[Deva, Romania|D\u00e9va]]) and the Austrian-Romanian administration retreated to Wallachia and Wallachian [[Oltenia]] (both were under Russian occupation). The last remaining resistance force was that of [[Avram Iancu]]: he retreated to harsh terrain, mounting a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign on Bem's forces, causing severe damage and blocking the route to Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (Alba Iulia). He was, however, challenged by severe shortages: the Romanians had few guns and very little gunpowder. The conflict dragged on for several months, with all Hungarian attempts to seize the mountain stronghold repulsed.\n\nIn April 1849, Iancu was approached by Hungarian envoy Ioan Drago\u0219 (a Romanian deputy in the Hungarian Parliament). Drago\u0219 was apparently acting from a desire for peace, and he worked to have Romanian leaders meet him in [[Abrud|Abrudb\u00e1nya (Abrud)]] and listen to the Hungarian demands. Iancu's adversary, Hungarian commander Imre Hatvany, seems to have exploited the provisional armistice to attack the Romanians in [[Abrud|Abrudb\u00e1nya (Abrud)]]. However, Iancu and his men retreated and encircled him.\n\n[[File:Avram Iancu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Avram Iancu]]|alt=Mustachioed man in greatcoat and large hat]]\n\nHatvany angered the Romanians by having Buteanu captured and murdered. As his position became weaker, he was attacked by Iancu's men until his defeat on May 22. Hatvany and most of his armed group were massacred by their adversaries; Iancu captured their [[cannon]]s, switching the tactical advantage for the next several months. [[Lajos Kossuth]] was angered by Hatvany's gesture (an inspection at the time dismissed all of Hatvany's close collaborators), since it made future negotiations unlikely.\n\nHowever, the conflict became less harsh: Iancu's men concentrated on seizing local resources and supplies, opting to inflict losses only through skirmishes. The Russian intervention in June precipitated an escalation, since the [[Poles]] fighting in the Hungarian revolutionary contingents wanted to resist the Tsarist armies. [[Henryk Dembi\u0144ski]], a Polish general, negotiated for a truce between Kossuth and the Wallachian [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] revolutionaries. The latter, who were close to Iancu (especially [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and [[Ion Ghica]]) wanted to defeat the Russian armies that had crushed [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|their movement]] in September 1848.\n\nB\u0103lcescu and Kossuth met in May 1849 at [[Debrecen]]. The contact has long been celebrated by Romanian [[Marxism|Marxist]] historians and politicians. [[Karl Marx]]'s condemnation of everything opposing Kossuth led to any Romanian initiative being automatically considered \"[[reactionary]]\". The agreement was not a pact: Kossuth flattered the Wallachians, encouraging them to persuade Iancu's armies leaving Transylvania to help B\u0103lcescu in [[Bucharest]]. While agreeing to mediate for peace, B\u0103lcescu never presented these terms to the fighters in the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. All Iancu agreed to was the neutrality of his forces in the conflict between Russia and Hungary. Thus, he secured his position as the Hungarian armies suffered defeats in July (culminating in the [[Battle of Segesv\u00e1r]]) and capitulated on August 13.\n[[File:Ethnographic map of austrian monarchy czoernig 1855.jpg|thumb|Ethnographic composition of the Austrian Empire (1855)]]\nAfter quashing the revolution, Austria imposed a repressive regime on Hungary and ruled Transylvania directly through a military governor, with German as the official language. Austria abolished the Union of Three Nations and acknowledged the Romanians. Although the former serfs were given land by the Austrian authorities, it was often barely sufficient for subsistence living. These poor conditions caused many Romanian families to cross into Wallachia and Moldavia in search for better lives.\n\n==={{anchor|Late Modern Era: The Austro-Hungarian Empire}}Austro-Hungarian Empire===\n[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|Austria-Hungary|alt=Multicolored map, with subdivisions and capital cities]]\n\nDue to external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable to secure the integrity of the Habsburg Empire. Major Austrian military defeats (such as the 1866 [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]) forced Austrian emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to concede internal reforms. To appease Hungarian separatism, the emperor made a deal with Hungary (the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], negotiated by [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]]) by which the dual monarchy of Austria\u2013Hungary came into existence. The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capitals, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a [[customs union]]. The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]]. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as [[King of Hungary]]. Romanian intellectuals issued the [[Blaj Pronouncement]] in protest of the Compromise.<ref>[http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/pas/pas14.htm The Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy and Romanian Political Autonomy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424202011/http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/pas/pas14.htm |date=April 24, 2007 }} in Pa\u015fcu, \u015etefan.

That level of growth compared favorably with that of other European nations, such as Britain (1.00 percent), France (1.06 percent), and Germany (1.51 percent). Technological growth accelerated industrialization and urbanization. Many state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. However, as a result of the Compromise the special status of Transylvania ended; it became a province under the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian diet]]. While part of Austria-Hungary, Transylvania's Romanians were oppressed by the Hungarian administration through [[Magyarization]];<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/modernhungarians00gero |url-access=registration |quote=assimilated. |title=Modern Hungarian Society in the Making: The Unfinished Experience |publisher=Central European University Press |author=Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151 |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernhungarians00gero/page/214 214] |date= January 1995|accessdate=2017-07-10|isbn=9781858660240 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9IR5KtcEYeMC&pg=PA256&dq=social+life+in+hungary+during+the+dual+monarchy+assimilation#v=onepage&q=assimilation&f=false |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |author1=Robert Bideleux |author2=Ian Jeffries |page=256 |date= September 12, 2007|accessdate=2017-07-10|isbn=9781134213191 }}</ref> German Saxons were also subject to this policy.\nDuring this time, Hungarian-administered Transylvania consisted of a 15-county ({{lang-hu|megye}}) region, covering 54,400&nbsp;km\u00b2 in the southeast of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The Hungarian counties at the time were [[Als\u00f3-Feh\u00e9r]], [[Beszterce-Nasz\u00f3d]], [[Brass\u00f3 (county)|Brass\u00f3]], [[Cs\u00edk]], [[Fogaras]], [[H\u00e1romsz\u00e9k]], [[Hunyad]], [[Kis-K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151]], [[Kolozs]], [[Maros-Torda]], [[Nagy-K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151]], [[Szeben]], [[Szolnok-Doboka]], [[Torda-Aranyos]], and [[Udvarhely]].\n\n=={{anchor|Transylvania as part of Romania}}Part of Romania==\n\n=== Greater Romania ===\n{{Main|Greater Romania|Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Campaign (World War I)}}\n{{See also|Union of Transylvania with Romania}}\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], the [[Kingdom of Romania]] refused to join the [[Central Powers]] and remained neutral, although Kings [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] and [[Ferdinand of Romania|Ferdinand I]] were from the [[Germans|German]] [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty. \n\nOn 17 August 1916, Romania signed a secret treaty (the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1916]]) with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] ([[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]), according to which the Allies agreed that [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]], and [[Partium]] would become part of Romania after the War if it entered the war. Romania joined the [[Triple Entente]] after signing the treaty and declared war against the [[Central Powers]] on 27 August 1916. It crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] into Transylvania, forcing the Central Powers to fight on another front. A German-[[Bulgaria]]n counter-offensive began the following month in [[Dobruja]] and in the Carpathians, driving the Romanian army back into Romania by mid-October and eventually leading to the capture of [[Bucharest]]. The exit of Russia from the war in March 1918 with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] left Romania alone in Eastern Europe, and a peace treaty between Romania and Germany was negotiated in May 1918. By mid-1918 the Central Powers were losing the war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and the [[Austro-Hungarian]] empire had begun to disintegrate. Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918, and the nations inside Austria-Hungary proclaimed their independence from the empire during September and October of that year.\n\nKing Ferdinand's wife, [[Marie of Edinburgh|Marie]] (who had British and Russian parentage) was highly influential during these years.<ref>{{cite book | last = Easterman | first = Alexander | title = King Carol, Hitler, and Lupescu | publisher = Victor Gollancz Ltd., London | year = 1942}}</ref>\n\n==== After World War I ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn 1918, as a result of the German defeat in World War I the Austro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed. On October 31, the successful [[Aster Revolution]] in [[Budapest]] brought the [[Social liberalism|left liberal]], pro-Entente count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]] to power as prime minister of Hungary. Influenced by Woodrow Wilson's pacifism, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the disarmament of Hungarian Army. The K\u00e1rolyi government outlawed all Hungarian armed associations and proposals intending to defend the country.\n\nThe resulting [[Treaty of Targu Lapus, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] was denounced in October 1918 by the Romanian government, which then re-entered the war on the [[Triple Entente|Allied]] side and advanced to the [[Mure\u0219 river|Mure\u0219 (Maros) river]] in Transylvania.\n\nThe leaders of Transylvania's [[Romanian National Party]] met and drafted a resolution invoking the right of self-determination (influenced by [[Woodrow Wilson's 14 points]]) for Transylvania's Romanian people, and proclaimed the unification of Transylvania with Romania. In November the Romanian National Central Council, representing all Romanians in Transylvania, notified the Budapest government that it would take control of twenty-three Transylvanian counties (and parts of three others) and requested a Hungarian response by November 2. The Hungarian government (after negotiations with the council) rejected the proposal, claiming that it failed to secure the rights of the ethnic Hungarian and German populations. In Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ([[Alba Iulia]]) on December 1, the [[National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary]] passed a resolution calling for the unification of all Romanians in a single state. The National Council of Transylvanian Germans and the Council of the [[Danube Swabians]] from the [[Banat]] approved the proclamation on 8 January 1919. In response, the Hungarian General Assembly of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsv\u00e1r]] (Cluj) reaffirmed the loyalty of Hungarians from Transylvania to Hungary on December 22, 1918.\n\n[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|Ethnic composition and partition of Hungary after World War I|alt=Green-and-grey map with pie charts]]\nThe Romanian Army, representing the [[Entente powers]], entered Transylvania from the east on November 12, 1918. In December they entered southern Transylvania, crossed the demarcation line on the Maros (Mure\u0219) river by mid-December and advanced to Kolozsv\u00e1r (Cluj) and M\u00e1ramarossziget ([[Sighet]]) after making a request to the Powers of Versailles to protect the Romanians in Transylvania. In February 1919, to prevent armed clashes between Romanian and withdrawing Hungarian troops, a neutral zone was created.\n\nThe prime minister of the newly proclaimed Republic of Hungary resigned in March 1919, refusing the territorial concessions (including Transylvania) demanded by the Entente. When the [[Hungarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] of [[Hungary]] (led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]]) came to power in March 1919, it proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]; after promising that Hungary would regain the lands under its control during the Austro-Hungarian Empire it attacked [[Czechoslovakia]] and Romania, leading to the [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919]]. The Hungarian army began an April 1919 offensive in Transylvania along the [[Some\u0219 River|Some\u0219 (Szamos)]] and [[Mure\u0219 river|Maros]] rivers. A Romanian counter-offensive pushed forward to reach the [[Tisza]] River in May. Another Hungarian offensive in July penetrated 60&nbsp;km into Romanian lines before a further Romanian counter-offensive led to the end of Hungarian Soviet Republic and after the occupation of [[Budapest]]. The Romanian army withdrew from Hungary between October 1919 and March 1920.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]], formally signed in June 1919, recognised the sovereignty of [[Romania]] over Transylvania. The Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St. Germain]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] (June 1920) further defined the status of Transylvania and the new border between the states of Hungary and Romania. [[Ferdinand of Romania|King Ferdinand I of Romania]] and [[Princess Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Maria of Romania]] were crowned at [[Alba Iulia]] in 1922.\n\n[[File:Romania MASSR 1924.png|thumb|left|Great Romania (1918\u20131940)|alt=Yellow, peach and orange map]]\n''Rom\u00e2nia Mare'' (\"Great Romania\") refers to the [[Romania]]n state between the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. [[Romania]] reached its greatest territorial extent, uniting almost all historical Romanian lands (except [[northern Maramure\u0219]], [[Serbian Banat|Western Banat]] and small areas of [[Partium]] and [[Cri\u0219ana]]). Great Romania was an ideal of Romanian [[nationalism]].\n\nAt the end of World War I Transylvania and [[Bessarabia]] were united with the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], the Deputies of Transylvanian Romanians declared the union of Transylvania with Romania in Alba Iulia on 1. December 1918.; Bessarabia, having declared independence from [[Russia]] in 1917 at the Conference of the Country (Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii), called in Romanian troops to protect the province from the [[Bolshevik]]s. The union of the Transylvania, [[Maramure\u0219]], [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Banat]] regions with the Old Kingdom of Romania was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], which recognised the sovereignty of Romania over these regions and settled the border between the Republic of Hungary and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The union of [[Bukovina]] and Bessarabia with Romania was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Romania had also acquired [[Southern Dobrudja]] from [[Bulgaria]] as a result of its victory in the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913.\n\n==={{anchor|Transylvania during World War II and Communism}}World War II and Communist era===\n[[File:Northern Transylvania yellow.png|thumb|Romania in 1940 with [[Northern Transylvania]] highlighted in yellow]]\n[[File:P\u00e9rdidasTerritorialesRumanas1940-ro.svg|thumb|left|Romania's territorial losses in the summer of 1940]]\n\nIn August 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the northern half of Transylvania ([[Northern Transylvania]]) was annexed to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]] by the second [[Second Vienna Award]], leaving [[Southern Transylvania]] to Romania. On March 19, 1944, following the occupation of Hungary by the [[Nazi German]] army through [[Operation Margarethe]], Northern Transylvania came under German military occupation. After [[King Michael's Coup]], Romania left the Axis and joined the Allies, and, as such, fought together with the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] against Nazi Germany, regaining Northern Transylvania. The Second Vienna Award was voided by the [[Allied Commission]] through the Armistice Agreement with Romania (September 12, 1944) whose Article 19 stipulated the following:\n{{quote|The Allied Governments regard the decision of the Vienna award regarding Transylvania as null and void and are agreed that Transylvania (or the greater part thereof) should be returned to Rumania, subject to confirmation at the peace settlement, and the Soviet Government agrees that Soviet forces shall take part for this purpose in joint military operations with Rumania against Germany and Hungary.}}\nThe 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] reaffirmed the borders between Romania and Hungary, as originally defined in [[Treaty of Trianon]], 27 years earlier, thus confirming the return of Northern Transylvania to Romania.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/place/Transylv]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>\nFrom 1947 to 1989, Transylvania, as the rest of Romania, was [[Socialist Republic of Romania|under a communist regime]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Transylvania today}}Present ===\n[[File:TransylvaniaProper.png|thumb|right|Map of Romania, with \"Transylvania proper\" in bright yellow]]\nToday, \"Transylvania proper\" is included within the Romanian counties (''[[jude\u021b]]e'') of [[Alba (county)|Alba]], [[Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud]], [[Bra\u0219ov County|Bra\u0219ov]], [[Cluj County|Cluj]], [[Covasna County|Covasna]], [[Harghita]], [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]], [[Mure\u0219 County|Mure\u0219]], [[S\u0103laj County|S\u0103laj]] and [[Sibiu County|Sibiu]].

The [[Transylvanian Diet|Diet]] of 1659 codified the [[coat of arms]]. While the Hungarians, Saxons and Szeklers are represented the Romanians are not, despite their proposal to include a representation of [[Dacia]].\n\nRegions are not legal administrative units in Romania; consequently, the coat of arms is only used within the [[coat of arms of Romania]]. This officially recognised image is based on the 1659 symbols, and includes the traditional Transylvania estates.\n\nAnother, short-lived heraldic representation of Transylvania is found on the coat of arms of [[Michael the Brave]]. Besides the Wallachian eagle and the Moldavian aurochs, Transylvania is represented by two lions holding a sword (referring to the [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]]) standing on seven hills.\n\nThe 1848 revolutionary movement proposed a revision to the Transylvanian coat of arms, with representation of the Romanian majority. To the 1659 representation it introduced a central section, portraying a [[Dacians|Dacian]] woman (symbolizing the [[Romania]]n nation) holding in her right hand a sickle and in her left a [[Roman legion]]'s flag with the initials \"D.F.\" (''Dacia Felix''). On the woman's right there was an eagle with a laurel crown in its beak, and on its left side a lion. This representation of the Romanian nation was inspired by a coin issued by the Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Marcus Julius Philippus]] at [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]] to honor the province of Dacia.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Historiography===\nThe history of Transylvania has been subject to disagreement between national narratives, especially those of Romania and Hungary.

In 1940 [[Northern Transylvania]] reverted to [[Hungary]] as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]], but it was reclaimed by Romania after the end of World War II.\n\nDue to its varied history the population of Transylvania is ethnically, linguistically, culturally and religiously diverse. From 1437 to 1848 political power in Transylvania was shared among the mostly [[Hungarian nobility]], German [[bourgeoisie|burghers]] and the [[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]] of the [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] (a Hungarian ethnic group). The population consisted of [[Romanians]], [[Hungarians]] (particularly Sz\u00e9kelys) and [[Germans]]. The majority of the present population is Romanian, but large minorities (mainly Hungarian and [[Romani people|Roma]]) preserve their traditions. However, as recently as the [[Communist Romania|communist era]] [[ethnic minority|ethnic-minority]] relations remained an issue of international contention. This has abated (but not disappeared) since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of 1989]] restored democracy in Romania. Transylvania retains a significant [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-speaking]] minority, slightly less than half of which identify themselves as Sz\u00e9kely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recensamant.ro/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424065630/http://www.recensamant.ro/ |archivedate=April 24, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Transylvanian Saxons|Ethnic Germans in Transylvania]] (known as Saxons) comprise about one percent of the population; however, Austrian and German influences remain in the architecture and urban landscape of much of Transylvania.\n\nThe region's history may be traced through the religions of its inhabitants. Most Romanians in Transylvania belong to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] faith, but from the 18th to the 20th centuries the [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] also had substantial influence. Hungarians primarily belong to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]] Churches; a smaller number are [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarians]]. Of the ethnic Germans in Transylvania, the Saxons have primarily been [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; however, the [[Danube Swabians]] are Catholic. The [[Baptist Union of Romania]] is the second-largest such body in Europe; [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are established, and other [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches have been a growing presence since 1989. No [[Muslim]] communities remain from the era of the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasions]].

Under [[Burebista]], the foremost king of Dacia and a contemporary of [[Julius Caesar]], the kingdom reached its maximum extent. The area now constituting Transylvania was the political center of Dacia.\n\nThe Dacians are often mentioned by [[Augustus]], according to whom they were compelled to recognize [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] supremacy. However, they were not subdued and in later times crossed the frozen [[Danube]] during winter and ravaging Roman cities in the recently acquired [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]].\n\nThe Dacians built several important [[Dacian cities|fortified cities]], among them [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] (near the present [[Hunedoara]]). They were divided into [[Comati|two classes]]: the aristocracy (''tarabostes'') and the common people (''comati'').\n\n=== The Roman-Dacian Wars ===\n{{Main|Decebalus|Domitian's Dacian War|Trajan's Dacian Wars|Battle of Sarmizegetusa|}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|[[Roman Dacia]]|alt=Green, purple, yellow and orange map]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] expansion in the [[Balkans]] brought the Dacians into open conflict with Rome. During the reign of [[Decebalus]], the Dacians were engaged in [[Domitian's Dacian War|several wars with the Romans]] from 85 to 89 CE. After two reverses the Romans gained an advantage but were obliged to make peace due to the defeat of [[Domitian]] by the [[Marcomanni]]. Domitian agreed to pay large sums (eight million [[sesterces]]) in annual tribute to the Dacians for maintaining peace.\n\n[[File:Comati dacians romanian government picture.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Population of Dacia represented on Trajan's Column|alt=Cross section of Dacian society]]\n\nIn 101 the emperor [[Trajan]] began a [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|military campaign]] against the [[Dacians]], which included a [[siege]] of Sarmizegetusa Regia and the occupation of part of the country. The Romans prevailed but Decebalus was left as a [[client king]] under a Roman [[protectorate]]. Three years later, the Dacians rebelled and destroyed the Roman troops in Dacia. As a result, Trajan quickly began a new campaign against them (105\u2013106). The [[Battle of Sarmizegetusa|battle for Sarmizegetusa Regia]] took place in the early summer of 106 with the participation of the [[Legio II Adiutrix|II Adiutrix]] and [[Legio IV Flavia Felix|IV Flavia Felix]] legions and a detachment (''vexillatio'') from the [[Legio VI Ferrata]]. The Dacians repelled the first attack, but the water pipes from the Dacian capital were destroyed. The city was set on fire, the pillars of the sacred sanctuaries were cut down and the fortification system was destroyed; however, the war continued. Through the treason of Bacilis (a confidant of the Dacian king), the Romans found [[Decebalus' treasure]] in the [[Strei River]] (estimated by [[Jerome Carcopino]] as 165,500&nbsp;kg of gold and 331,000&nbsp;kg of silver). The last battle with the army of the Dacian king took place at [[Porolissum]] (Moigrad).\n\nDacian culture encouraged its soldiers to not fear death, and it was said that they left for war merrier than for any other journey. In his retreat to the mountains, Decebalus was followed by [[Roman cavalry]] led by [[Tiberius Claudius Maximus]]. The Dacian religion of [[Zalmoxis]] permitted suicide as a last resort by those in pain and misery, and the Dacians who heard Decebalus' last speech dispersed and committed suicide. Only the king tried to retreat from the Romans, hoping that he could find in the mountains and forests the means to resume battle, but the Roman cavalry followed him closely. After they almost caught him, Decebalus committed suicide by slashing his throat with his sword ([[Dacian falx|falx]]).\n\nThe history of the Dacian Wars was written by [[Cassius Dio]], and they are also depicted on [[Trajan's Column]] in [[Rome]].\n\nFollowing the war, several parts of Dacia including Transylvania were organized into the Roman province of [[Dacia Trajana|Dacia Traiana]].\n\n{{anchor|Late antiquity: after the Roman province Dacia}}\n=== Roman Dacia ===\n{{Main|||||Roman Dacia}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:DonariumBiertan.JPG|thumb|The [[Biertan Donarium]], an early Christian votive object of the early fourth century.

The region developed a strong infrastructure and an economy based on agriculture, cattle farming and mining. Colonists from [[Thracia]], [[Moesia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Gaul]], [[Syria]] and other Roman provinces were brought in to settle the land, developing cities like Apulum (now [[Alba Iulia]]) and Napoca (now [[Cluj Napoca]]) into [[municipium]]s and [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]s.\n\nDuring the third century, increasing pressure from the [[Free Dacians]] and [[Visigoths]] forced the Romans to abandon Dacia Traiana.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] in Liber IX of his ''Breviarum,'' in 271, Roman citizens from Dacia Traiana were resettled by the Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] across the Danube in the newly established [[Dacia Aureliana]], inside former [[Moesia|Moesia Superior]]:\n\n{{Quote|[Aurelian] gave up the province of Dacia, which Trajan had created beyond the Danube, since the whole of Illyricum and Moesia had been devastated and he despaired of being able to retain it, and he withdrew the Romans from the cities and countryside of Dacia, and resettled them in the middle of Moesia and named it Dacia, which now divides the two Moeasias and is on the right bank of the Danube as it flows to the sea, whereas previously it was on the left.|Eutropius, ''Breviarium historiae romana&nbsp;\u2013 Liber IX, XV''}}\n\nHistorian Konrad G\u00fcndisch says that findings from the 4th to the 7th centuries{{spaced ndash}}especially Roman coins, the [[Biertan Donarium]] and other objects with Latin inscription and early Christian artifacts{{spaced ndash}}evidence that part of the [[Vulgar Latin]]-speaking, Christian [[Daco-Roman]] ([[Proto-Romanian]]) population remained in Dacia Traiana and flourished in remote communities.<ref name=\"Gundisch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sibiweb.de/geschi/7b-history.htm |title=The History of Transylvania and the Transylvanian Saxons |website=Sibiweb.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707001956/http://www.sibiweb.de/geschi/7b-history.htm |archive-date=July 7, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBefore their withdrawal the Romans negotiated an agreement with the [[Goths]] in which Dacia remained Roman territory, and a few Roman outposts remained north of the Danube.

However, a famine broke out and Rome was unable to supply them with food or land. As a result, the Goths [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|rebelled against the Romans for several years]]. The Huns fought the [[Alans]], [[Vandals]], and [[Quadi]], forcing them toward the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]]. Pannonia became the centre during the peak of [[Attila]]'s reign (435\u2013453).<ref name=\"Gundisch\"/>\n\nAfter Attila's death, the Hunnic empire disintegrated.

During this period the [[Slavs]] were allowed to settle inside Transylvania. The Avars declined with the rise of [[Charlemagne]]'s Frankish empire. After a war between the [[khagan]] and [[Yugurrus]] from 796 to 803, the Avars were defeated. The Transylvanian Avars were subjugated by the [[Bulgars]] under Khan [[Krum]] at the beginning of the ninth century; Transylvania and eastern [[Pannonia]] were incorporated into the [[History of Bulgaria|First Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n[[File:Gesta hungarorum map.jpg|thumb|S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rki's map of the Vlach-Slavic voivodship (duchy) of Gelou (Transylvania) in the ninth century, according to ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''|alt=Multicolored map of Central Europe before the arrival of the Hungarians]]\n\nIn 862 Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia]] rebelled against the [[Franks]] and, after hiring [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] troops, won his independence; this was the first time that Magyar expeditionary troops entered the Carpathian Basin.<ref>Kos\u00e1ry Domokos, ''Bevezet\u00e9s a magyar t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelem forr\u00e1saiba \u00e9s irodalm\u00e1ba 1'', p. 29</ref> After a Bulgar and Pecheneg attack, the Magyar tribes crossed the Carpathians around 896 and occupied the basin without significant resistance.

[[Gelou]] is described as \"a certain Vlach\" (''quidam Blacus'') and a leader of the Vlachs and Slavs in Transylvania.

He was, according to the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', a ''voivod'' from Bundyn ([[Vidin]]) who ruled the territory of [[Banat]] in the Vidin region of southern Transylvania. Glad was said to have authority over the [[Slav]]s and [[Vlach]]s. The Hungarians sent an army against him, subduing the population between the ''Morisio'' ([[Mure\u0219 river|Mure\u0219]]) and ''Temes'' ([[Timi\u0219 River|Timi\u0219]]) rivers. When they tried to cross the Timi\u0219, Glad attacked them with an army which included Cuman, Bulgarian and Vlach support. The next day, Glad was defeated by the Hungarians. Hungarian historiography regards him as fictitious, along with many other imaginary characters in the Gesta. Romanian historiography, on the other hand, identifies him as a real person and places the Hungarian attack against Glad into 934. His name might come from the same Hungarian word, meaning \"perfidious, mean, atrocious\".\n\n[[Ahtum|Ahtum or Ajtony]] was a local duke in Banat, and the last ruler who resisted the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary, in the early 11th century. He taxed salt on the Maros (Mure\u015f) carried to King [[Stephen I of Hungary]] on the river. Ajtony's commander-in-chief was [[Csan\u00e1d]], and the king placed the latter at the head of a royal attack. Ajtony was defeated by the army of Stephen I of Hungary, with his stronghold being renamed Csan\u00e1d afterwards. Ahtum's ethnicity (and that of his people) is controversial; his name is thought to translate \"gold\" in [[Old Turkic]].\n\n[[Menumorut]] is described by Anonymus as duke of the [[Khazars]] between the River Tisza and the Ygfon Forest near Ultrasilvania (Transylvania), from the Mure\u0219 to the [[Some\u0219 River]]s. According to the deeds in ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'', he declined the 907 request of the Magyar ruler \u00c1rp\u00e1d to surrender his territory between the Some\u0219 and the Meses Mountains. In negotiations with ambassadors Usubuu and Veluc from \u00c1rp\u00e1d he invoked the sovereignty of the Byzantine emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]]:\n\n{{quote|The ambassadors of \u00c1rp\u00e1d crossed the Tisza and came to the capital fortress of [[Biharia]], demanding important territories on the left bank of the river for their duke. Menumorut replied: \"Tell \u00c1rp\u00e1d, duke of Hungary, your lord: Indebted we are to him as a friend to a friend, with all requisite to him, since he is a stranger and lacks many. Yet the territory he asked from our good will never will we bestow as long as we will be alive. And we felt sorry that duke Salanus conceded him a very large territory out either of love, which it is said, or out of fear, which is denied. Ourself on the other hand, neither out of love nor out of fear, we will ever concede him land, not even if spanning only a finger, although he said he has a right on it.

In this version, he married his daughter into the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty. Her son Taksony became ruler of the Magyars and father of Mih\u00e1ly and G\u00e9za (whose son Vajk became the first king of Hungary in 1001 under his baptismal name, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen]]).\n\nI.A.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the areas in the south and northeast were settled by [[Germans|German]] colonists known as [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]]. Tradition holds that ''Siebenb\u00fcrgen'', the German name for Transylvania, derives from the seven principal fortified towns founded by these [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. The German influence became more marked when, in 1211, King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] called on the [[Teutonic Knights]] to protect Transylvania in the [[Burzenland]] from the [[Cuman people|Cumans]]. After the order strengthened its grip on the territory and expanded it beyond Transylvania without authorisation, Andrew expelled the Knights in 1225.\n\nIn 1241, Transylvania suffered during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]] invaded Transylvania from the [[Oituz|Oituz (Ojtoz)]] Pass, while [[Subutai]] attacked in the south from the Mehedia Pass towards [[Or\u0219ova]].<ref>James Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe''.

Before then, the word ''isp\u00e1n'' was used for the chief official of [[Alba County]]. Transylvania came under ''voivod'' rule after 1263, when the duties of the Counts of Szolnok (Doboka) and Alba were eliminated. The voivod controlled seven ''[[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|comitatus]]''. According to the ''Chronica Pictum'' Transylvania's first voivod was Zolt\u00e1n Erdoelue, a relative of King Stephen.\n\nThe three most important 14th-century dignitaries were the voivod, the Bishop of Transylvania and the Abbot of Kolozsmonostor (on the outskirts of present-day Cluj-Napoca). Transylvania was organized according to the [[Estate of the realm|estate]] system. Its estates were privileged groups, or ''universitates'' (the central power acknowledged some collective freedoms), with socio-economic and political power; they were also organized using ethnic criteria.\n\nAs in the rest of the Hungarian kingdom, the first estate was the aristocracy (lay and ecclesiastic): ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing homogenization around its Hungarian nucleus. The document granting privileges to the aristocracy was the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], issued by King Andrew II. The other estates were the Saxons, Szeklers and Romanians, all with an ethno-linguistic basis. The Saxons, who had settled in southern Transylvania in the 12th and 13th centuries, were granted privileges in 1224 by the [[Diploma Andreanum]]. The Szeklers and Romanians were granted partial privileges. While the Szeklers consolidated their privileges, extending them to the entire ethnic group, the Romanians had difficulty retaining their privileges in certain areas (''terrae Vlachorum or districtus Valachicales'') and lost their estate rank. Nevertheless, when the king (or the voivod) summoned the general assembly of Transylvania (''congregatio'') during the 13th and 14th centuries it was attended by the four estates: noblemen, Saxons, Szeklers and Romanians (''Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis in partibus Transiluanis'').\n\n===={{anchor|Transylvania as part of the Kingdom of Hungary: later Middle Ages}}Later Middle Ages====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Transylvania16cent adm div.PNG|thumb|left|Administrative divisions of Transylvania, early 16th century|alt=Green, yellow and grey map]]\n\nAfter 1366, Romanians gradually lost their estate status (''[[Universitas Valachorum]]'') and were excluded from Transylvanian assemblies. The primary reason was religious; during Louis I's proselytization campaign, privileged status was deemed incompatible with [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in a state endowed with an \"apostolic mission\" by the Holy See. In his 1366 [[Decree of Turda]] the king redefined nobility as membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], thus excluding the [[Eastern Orthodox]], \"schismatic\" Romanians. After 1366, nobility was determined not only by ownership of land and people but also by the possession of a royal donation certificate. Since the Romanian social elite\u2014chiefly made up of aldermen (''iudices'') or ''knezes'' (''kenezii''), who ruled their villages according to the law of the land (''ius valachicum'')\u2014managed only somewhat to obtain writs of donation and were expropriated. Lacking property or an official status as owner and excluded from privileges as schismatics, the Romanian elite could no longer form an estate and participate in the country's assemblies.\n\nIn 1437 Hungarian and Romanian peasants, the [[petty nobility]] and burghers from Kolozsv\u00e1r (Klausenburg, now [[Cluj]]), under [[Antal Nagy de Buda]], [[Budai Nagy Antal Revolt|rose against their feudal masters]] and proclaimed their own estate (''universitas hungarorum et valachorum'', \"the estate of Hungarians and Romanians\"). To suppress the revolt the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, the Saxon burghers and the Sz\u00e9kelys formed the [[Unio Trium Nationum]] (Union of the Three Nations): a mutual-aid alliance against the peasants, pledging to defend their privileges against any power except that of Hungary's king. By 1438, the rebellion was crushed. From 1438 onwards the political system was based on the [[Unio Trium Nationum]], and society was regulated by these three estates: the nobility (mostly Hungarians), the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] and Saxon burghers. These estates, however, were more social and religious than ethnic divisions. Directed against the peasants, the Union limited the number of estates (excluding the Orthodox from political and social life in Transylvania): \"The privileges define the status of the three recognized nations - the Hungarians, the Siculi and the Saxons - and the four churches - Lutheran, Calvinist, Unitarian and Catholic. The exclusion concerns the Romanian community and its Orthodox Church, a community that accounts for at least 50% of the population in the mid-eighteenth century.\"<ref>''\"Les privil\u00e8ges d\u00e9finissent le statut des trois nations reconnues \u2013 les Hongrois, les Sicules et les Saxons \u2013 et des quatres Eglises \u2013 luth\u00e9rienne, calvinistes, unitarienne et catholique.

Unlike [[History of Maramure\u0219|Maramure\u0219]], after the Decree of Turda in Transylvania the only way to remain (or become) nobility was conversion to Roman Catholicism. To preserve their positions, some Romanian families converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and were Magyarized (such as the Hunyadi/Corvinus, Bed\u0151h\u00e1zi, Bilkei, Ilosvai, Dr\u00e1gffy, D\u00e1nfi, R\u00e9k\u00e1si, Dobozi, Mutnoki, D\u00e9si and Majl\u00e1th families). Some reached the highest ranks of society; [[Nicolaus Olahus]] became Archbishop of Esztergom, [[John Hunyadi]], a great military commander, governor and regent of Hungary, while the John Hunyadi's son [[Matthias Corvinus]] became king of Hungary.\n\nNevertheless, since the majority of Romanians did not convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] there was nowhere for them to be politically represented until the 19th century. They were deprived of their rights and subject to segregation (such as not being allowed to live in or purchase houses in the cities, build stone churches or receive justice. Several examples of legal decisions by the three nations a century after Unio Trium Nationum (1542\u20131555) are indicative. The Romanian could not appeal for justice against Hungarians and Saxons, but the latter could turn in the Romanian (1552); the Hungarian (''Hungarus'') accused of robbery could be defended by the oath of the village judge and three honest men, while the Romanian (''Valachus'') needed the oath of the village ''knez'', four Romanians and three Hungarians (1542); the Hungarian peasant could be punished after being accused by seven trustworthy people, while the Romanian was punished after accusations by only three (1554).\n\nAfter a diversionary manoeuvre led by Sultan Murad II it was clear that the goal of the Ottomans was not to consolidate their grip on the Balkans and intimidate the Hungarians, but to conquer Hungary. A key figure in Transylvania at this time was [[John Hunyadi]] (c. 1387 or 1400\u20131456). Hunyadi was awarded a number of estates (becoming one of the foremost landowners in Hungarian history) and a seat on the royal council for his service to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]]. After supporting the candidature of [[Ladislaus III of Poland]] for the Hungarian throne, he was rewarded in 1440 with the captaincy of the fortress of N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ([[Belgrade]]) and the [[voivodship]] of Transylvania (with his fellow voivod Miklos \u00dajlaki). His subsequent military exploits (he is considered one of the foremost generals of the Middle Ages) against the [[Ottoman Empire]] brought him further status as the [[regent]] of [[Hungary]] in 1446 and papal recognition as the Prince of Transylvania in 1448.\n\n==Modern era==\n=== {{anchor|Early Modern Era: Transylvania as an autonomous principality}}Early autonomous principality ===\n{{Main|Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Treaty of Speyer (1570)|Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)}}\n\nWhen the main Hungarian army and King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiello]] were slain by the Ottomans in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], [[John Z\u00e1polya]]\u2014voivod of Transylvania, who opposed the succession of Ferdinand of Austria (later [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]]) to the Hungarian throne\u2014took advantage of his military strength. When John I was elected king of Hungary, another party recognized Ferdinand. In the ensuing struggle Z\u00e1polya was supported by [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman I]], who (after Z\u00e1polya's death in 1540) overran central Hungary to protect Z\u00e1polya's son John II.

It was now beyond the reach of Catholic religious authority, allowing [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] preaching to flourish. In 1563 [[Giorgio Blandrata]] was appointed court physician; his radical religious ideas influenced young King John II and Calvinist bishop [[Francis David]], eventually converting both to [[Unitarianism]]. Francis David prevailed over Calvinist [[Peter Melius]] in 1568 in a public debate, resulting in individual freedom of religious expression under the [[Edict of Turda]] (the first such legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe). Lutherans, Calvinists, Unitarians and Roman Catholics received protection, while the majority [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was tolerated.\n\nTransylvania was governed by princes and its [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] (parliament). The [[Transylvanian Diet]] consisted of three estates: the Hungarian elite (largely ethnic [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[nobility]] and [[clergy]]), Saxon leaders (German burghers) and the free [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely Hungarians]].\n\n[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|The three principalities under [[Michael the Brave]]|alt=Orange, green and yellow map of 1600 holdings]]\n\nThe B\u00e1thory family, which assumed power at the death of John II in 1571, ruled Transylvania as princes under the Ottomans (and briefly under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] suzerainty) until 1602. The younger Stephen B\u00e1thory, a Hungarian Catholic who later became King Stephen B\u00e1thory of [[Poland]], tried to maintain the religious liberty granted by the Edict of Turda but interpreted this obligation in an increasingly restricted sense. Under [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Transylvania entered the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]], which began as a Christian alliance against the Turks and became a four-sided conflict in Transylvania involving the Transylvanians, [[Habsburg]]s, Ottomans and the Romanian voivod of [[Wallachia]] led by [[Michael the Brave]].\n\nMichael gained control of Transylvania (supported by the [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Szeklers]]) in October 1599 after the [[Battle of \u0218elimb\u0103r]], in which he defeated [[Andrew B\u00e1thory]]'s army. B\u00e1thory was killed by Szeklers who hoped to regain their old privileges with Michael's help. In May 1600 Michael gained control of [[Moldavia]], thus he became the leader of the three principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania (the three major regions of modern Romania). Michael installed Wallachian boyars in certain offices but did not interfere with the estates and sought support from the Hungarian nobility. In 1600 he was defeated by [[Giorgio Basta]] (Captain of [[Upper Hungary]]) and lost his Moldavian holdings to the Poles. After presenting his case to [[Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]] (capital of Germany), Michael was rewarded for his service.<ref>{{cite web|author=Miron Costin |url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002975CP0 |title=Grausame Zeiten in der Moldau.

Basta subdued Transylvania in 1604, initiating a reign of terror in which he was authorised to appropriate land belonging to noblemen, [[Germanization|Germanize]] the population and reclaim the principality for Catholicism in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. The period between 1601 (the assassination of Michael the Brave) and 1604 (the fall of Basta) was the most difficult for Transylvania since the Mongol invasion. ''\"Misericordia dei quod non-consumti sumus\"'' (\"only God's mercy saves us from annihilation\") characterised this period, according to an anonymous Saxon writer.\n\n[[File:Transylvanian Principality.svg|thumb|Principality of Transylvania, 1606\u20131660|alt=Multicolored map, depicting rivers]]\n\nFrom 1604 to 1606, the [[Calvinist]] Bihar magnate [[Istv\u00e1n Bocskay]] led a successful rebellion against Habsburg rule. Bocskay was elected Prince of Transylvania April 5, 1603, and Prince of Hungary two months later. The two major achievements of Bocskay's brief reign (he died December 29, 1606) were the [[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]] (June 23, 1606) and the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] (November 1606). With the Peace of Vienna Bocskay obtained religious liberty, the restoration of all confiscated estates, repeal of all \"unrighteous\" judgments, full retroactive amnesty for all Hungarians in [[Royal Hungary]] and recognition as independent sovereign prince of an enlarged Transylvania. Almost-equally important was the twenty-year Peace of Zsitvatorok, negotiated by Bocskay between Sultan [[Ahmed I]] and Rudolf II.\n\nGabriel Bethlen (who reigned from 1613 to 1629) thwarted all efforts of the emperor to oppress (or circumvent) his subjects, and won a reputation abroad by championing the Protestant cause. He waged war on the emperor three times, was proclaimed [[King of Hungary]] twice and obtained a confirmation of the Treaty of Vienna for the Protestants (and seven additional counties in northern Hungary for himself) in the [[Peace of Nikolsburg]] signed December 31, 1621. Bethlen's successor, George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, was equally successful. His principal achievement was the Peace of [[Linz]] (September 16, 1645), the last political triumph of Hungarian Protestantism, in which the emperor was forced to reconfirm the articles of the Peace of Vienna. Gabriel Bethlen and George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi aided education and culture, and their reign has been called the golden era of Transylvania.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} They lavished money on their capital [[Alba Iulia]] (''Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r'' or ''Wei\u00dfenburg''), which became the main bulwark of Protestantism in [[Central Europe]]. During their reign, Transylvania was one of the few European countries where Roman Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans and Unitarians lived in mutual tolerance\u2014all officially accepted religions (''religiones recaepte''). The Orthodox, however, still had inferior status.\n\nThis golden age (and relative independence) of Transylvania ended with the reign of [[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]. The prince, coveting the Polish crown, allied with Sweden and invaded [[Poland]] in 1657 despite the [[Ottoman Porte]]'s prohibition of military action. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was defeated in Poland and his army taken hostage by the Tatars. Chaotic years followed, with a quick succession of princes fighting one another and R\u00e1k\u00f3czi unwilling to resign, despite the Turkish threat of military attack. To resolve the political situation, the Turks resorted to military might; invasions of Transylvania with their Crimean Tatar allies, the ensuing loss of territory (particularly their primary Transylvanian stronghold, [[V\u00e1rad]], in 1660) and diminished manpower led to [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|Prince John Kem\u00e9ny]] proclaiming the secession of Transylvania from the Ottomans in April 1661 and appealing for help to Vienna. A secret Habsburg-Ottoman agreement, however, prevented the Habsburgs from intervening; Kem\u00e9ny's defeat by the Turks (and the Turkish installation of the weak [[Mih\u00e1ly Apafi]] on the throne) marked the subordination of Transylvania, now a [[client state]] of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n<gallery heights=200 mode=packed>\nFile:Kober Stephen Bathory.jpg|alt=Bearded man, standing in red cloak|[[Stephen B\u00e1thory]], who was elected King of Poland\nFile:Michael-of-walachia.jpg|alt=Bearded man with mustache, wearing large round hat with feather|[[Michael the Brave]], Lord of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania\nFile:Nte-kir-bocskai.jpg|alt=Statue of bearded man with hat, holding a scepter|Prince [[Stephen Bocskay]]\nFile:Gabriel Bethlen.jpg|alt=Ornate drawing of bearded man holding a scepter|Prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]]\nFile:I.r\u00e1k\u00f3czi gy\u00f6rgy.jpg|alt=Drawing of bearded man wearing an ornate hat|[[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], Prince of Transylvania\n</gallery>\n\n=== {{anchor|Modern Era: Habsburg rule}}Habsburg rule ===\n{{Main|Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an}}\n{{See also|Early Modern Romania|Early Modern Moldavia|Early Modern Wallachia}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Closca.jpg|thumb|Public execution of [[Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an|Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an]]|alt=Drawing of well-attended execution]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, the Habsburgs began to impose their rule on Transylvania. In addition to strengthening the central government and administration, they promoted the Roman Catholic Church as a uniting force and to weaken the influence of Protestant nobility. By creating a conflict between Protestants and Catholics, the Habsburgs hoped to weaken the estates. They also attempted to persuade Orthodox clergymen to join the [[Uniate]] (Greek Catholic) Church, which accepted four key points of Catholic doctrine and acknowledged papal authority while retaining Orthodox rituals and traditions. [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] decreed Transylvania's [[Orthodox Church]] in union with the Roman Catholic Church by joining the newly created [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]]. Some priests converted, although the similarity between the two denominations was unclear to many. In response to the Habsburg policy of converting all Romanian Orthodox to Greek-Catholics, several peaceful movements within the Romanian Orthodox population advocated freedom of worship for all Transylvanians; notable leaders were Visarion Sarai, Nicolae Oprea Micl\u0103u\u0219 and [[Sofronie of Cioara]].\n\nFrom 1711 onward, Habsburg control over Transylvania was consolidated and Transylvanian princes were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Grand+Principality+of+Transylvania |title=Grand Principality of Transylvania &#124; Article about Grand Principality of Transylvania by The Free Dictionary |website=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref> In 1765 the [[Grand Principality of Transylvania]] was proclaimed, consolidating the separate status of Transylvania within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] established by the 1691 Diploma Leopoldinum.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=Leopoldinum/> Hungarian historiography sees this as a formality.<ref>{{cite web |title=JOHN HUNYADI: Hungary in American History Textbooks |url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/hunyadi/hu03.htm |work=Andrew L.

The insurgents' main demands were related to feudal serfdom and the lack of political equality between Romanians and other Transylvanian ethnic groups. They fought at [[C\u00e2mpeni|Top\u00e1nfalva (Topesdorf/C\u00e2mpeni)]], Abrudb\u00e1nya (Gro\u00dfschlatten/Abrud) and Verespatak (Goldbach/Ro\u0219ia), defeating the Habsburg Imperial Army at Br\u00e1d (Tannenhof/Brad) on November 27, 1784. The revolt was crushed on February 28, 1785, at Dealul Furcilor (Forks Hill), Alba-Iulia, when the leaders were apprehended. Horea and Clo\u0219ca were executed by [[breaking on the wheel]]; Cri\u0219an hanged himself the night before his execution.\n\nIn 1791 the Romanians petitioned [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]] for religious equality and recognition as a fourth \"nation\" in Transylvania ([[Supplex Libellus Valachorum]]). The Transylvanian Diet rejected their demands, restoring the Romanians to their marginalised status.\n\nIn early 1848, the Hungarian Diet took the opportunity presented by [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution]] to enact a comprehensive program of legislative reform (the [[April laws]]), which included a provision for the union of Transylvania and Hungary. Transylvanian Romanians initially welcomed the revolution, believing they would benefit from the reforms. However, their position changed due to the opposition of Transylvanian nobles to reform (such as emancipation of the serfs) and the failure of Hungarian revolutionary leaders to recognise Romanian national interests. In mid-May a Romanian diet at [[Blaj|Bal\u00e1zsfalva]] produced its own revolutionary program, calling for proportional representation of Romanians in the [[Transylvanian Diet]] and an end to social and ethnic oppression. The Saxons were concerned about union with Hungary, fearing the loss of their traditional privileges. When the Transylvanian Diet met on May 29, the vote for union was pushed through despite objections from many Saxon deputies. On June 10, the Emperor sanctioned the union vote of the Diet. Military executions and the arrest of revolutionary leaders after the union hardened the Saxons' position. In September 1848, another Romanian assembly in Bal\u00e1zsfalva (Blaj) denounced the union with Hungary and called for an armed uprising in Transylvania. War broke out in November, with Romanian and Saxon troops (under Austrian command) battling Hungarians led by Polish general [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]. Within four months, Bem had ousted the Austrians from Transylvania. However, in June 1849 Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] responded to an appeal from Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] to send Russian troops into Transylvania. After initial successes against the Russians, Bem's army was defeated decisively at the Battle of Temesv\u00e1r ([[Timi\u0219oara]]) on August 9; the surrender of Hungary followed.\n\n[[File:J\u00f3zef Bem 111.JPG|thumb|[[J\u00f3zef Bem]]]]\n\nThe Austrians clearly rejected the October demand that ethnic criteria become the basis for internal borders, with the goal of creating a province for Romanians (Transylvania, alongside [[Banat]] and [[Bukovina]]); they did not want to replace the threat of Hungarian nationalism with a potential one of Romanian [[separatism]]. However, they did not declare themselves hostile to the creation of Romanian administrative offices in Transylvania (which prevented Hungary from including the region in all but name). The territory was organized into ''prefecturi'' (prefectures), with Avram Iancu and Buteanu two prefects in the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. Iancu's prefecture, the ''Auraria Gemina'' (a name charged with [[Latin]] symbolism), became important; it took over from bordering areas which were never fully organized.\n\nAdministrative efforts were then halted as Hungarians, under J\u00f3zef Bem, carried out an offensive through Transylvania. With the covert assistance of [[Imperial Russia]]n troops, the Austrian army (except for garrisons at [[Alba Iulia|Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] and [[Deva, Romania|D\u00e9va]]) and the Austrian-Romanian administration retreated to Wallachia and Wallachian [[Oltenia]] (both were under Russian occupation). The last remaining resistance force was that of [[Avram Iancu]]: he retreated to harsh terrain, mounting a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign on Bem's forces, causing severe damage and blocking the route to Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (Alba Iulia). He was, however, challenged by severe shortages: the Romanians had few guns and very little gunpowder. The conflict dragged on for several months, with all Hungarian attempts to seize the mountain stronghold repulsed.\n\nIn April 1849, Iancu was approached by Hungarian envoy Ioan Drago\u0219 (a Romanian deputy in the Hungarian Parliament). Drago\u0219 was apparently acting from a desire for peace, and he worked to have Romanian leaders meet him in [[Abrud|Abrudb\u00e1nya (Abrud)]] and listen to the Hungarian demands. Iancu's adversary, Hungarian commander Imre Hatvany, seems to have exploited the provisional armistice to attack the Romanians in [[Abrud|Abrudb\u00e1nya (Abrud)]]. However, Iancu and his men retreated and encircled him.\n\n[[File:Avram Iancu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Avram Iancu]]|alt=Mustachioed man in greatcoat and large hat]]\n\nHatvany angered the Romanians by having Buteanu captured and murdered. As his position became weaker, he was attacked by Iancu's men until his defeat on May 22. Hatvany and most of his armed group were massacred by their adversaries; Iancu captured their [[cannon]]s, switching the tactical advantage for the next several months. [[Lajos Kossuth]] was angered by Hatvany's gesture (an inspection at the time dismissed all of Hatvany's close collaborators), since it made future negotiations unlikely.\n\nHowever, the conflict became less harsh: Iancu's men concentrated on seizing local resources and supplies, opting to inflict losses only through skirmishes. The Russian intervention in June precipitated an escalation, since the [[Poles]] fighting in the Hungarian revolutionary contingents wanted to resist the Tsarist armies. [[Henryk Dembi\u0144ski]], a Polish general, negotiated for a truce between Kossuth and the Wallachian [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] revolutionaries. The latter, who were close to Iancu (especially [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and [[Ion Ghica]]) wanted to defeat the Russian armies that had crushed [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|their movement]] in September 1848.\n\nB\u0103lcescu and Kossuth met in May 1849 at [[Debrecen]]. The contact has long been celebrated by Romanian [[Marxism|Marxist]] historians and politicians. [[Karl Marx]]'s condemnation of everything opposing Kossuth led to any Romanian initiative being automatically considered \"[[reactionary]]\". The agreement was not a pact: Kossuth flattered the Wallachians, encouraging them to persuade Iancu's armies leaving Transylvania to help B\u0103lcescu in [[Bucharest]]. While agreeing to mediate for peace, B\u0103lcescu never presented these terms to the fighters in the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. All Iancu agreed to was the neutrality of his forces in the conflict between Russia and Hungary. Thus, he secured his position as the Hungarian armies suffered defeats in July (culminating in the [[Battle of Segesv\u00e1r]]) and capitulated on August 13.\n[[File:Ethnographic map of austrian monarchy czoernig 1855.jpg|thumb|Ethnographic composition of the Austrian Empire (1855)]]\nAfter quashing the revolution, Austria imposed a repressive regime on Hungary and ruled Transylvania directly through a military governor, with German as the official language. Austria abolished the Union of Three Nations and acknowledged the Romanians. Although the former serfs were given land by the Austrian authorities, it was often barely sufficient for subsistence living. These poor conditions caused many Romanian families to cross into Wallachia and Moldavia in search for better lives.\n\n==={{anchor|Late Modern Era: The Austro-Hungarian Empire}}Austro-Hungarian Empire===\n[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|Austria-Hungary|alt=Multicolored map, with subdivisions and capital cities]]\n\nDue to external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable to secure the integrity of the Habsburg Empire. Major Austrian military defeats (such as the 1866 [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]) forced Austrian emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to concede internal reforms. To appease Hungarian separatism, the emperor made a deal with Hungary (the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], negotiated by [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]]) by which the dual monarchy of Austria\u2013Hungary came into existence. The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capitals, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a [[customs union]]. The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]]. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as [[King of Hungary]]. Romanian intellectuals issued the [[Blaj Pronouncement]] in protest of the Compromise.<ref>[http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/pas/pas14.htm The Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy and Romanian Political Autonomy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424202011/http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/pas/pas14.htm |date=April 24, 2007 }} in Pa\u015fcu, \u015etefan.

That level of growth compared favorably with that of other European nations, such as Britain (1.00 percent), France (1.06 percent), and Germany (1.51 percent). Technological growth accelerated industrialization and urbanization. Many state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. However, as a result of the Compromise the special status of Transylvania ended; it became a province under the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian diet]].

Romania joined the [[Triple Entente]] after signing the treaty and declared war against the [[Central Powers]] on 27 August 1916. It crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] into Transylvania, forcing the Central Powers to fight on another front. A German-[[Bulgaria]]n counter-offensive began the following month in [[Dobruja]] and in the Carpathians, driving the Romanian army back into Romania by mid-October and eventually leading to the capture of [[Bucharest]]. The exit of Russia from the war in March 1918 with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] left Romania alone in Eastern Europe, and a peace treaty between Romania and Germany was negotiated in May 1918.

On October 31, the successful [[Aster Revolution]] in [[Budapest]] brought the [[Social liberalism|left liberal]], pro-Entente count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]] to power as prime minister of Hungary. Influenced by Woodrow Wilson's pacifism, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the disarmament of Hungarian Army. The K\u00e1rolyi government outlawed all Hungarian armed associations and proposals intending to defend the country.\n\nThe resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] was denounced in October 1918 by the Romanian government, which then re-entered the war on the [[Triple Entente|Allied]] side and advanced to the [[Mure\u0219 river|Mure\u0219 (Maros) river]] in Transylvania.\n\nThe leaders of Transylvania's [[Romanian National Party]] met and drafted a resolution invoking the right of self-determination (influenced by [[Woodrow Wilson's 14 points]]) for Transylvania's Romanian people, and proclaimed the unification of Transylvania with Romania. In November the Romanian National Central Council, representing all Romanians in Transylvania, notified the Budapest government that it would take control of twenty-three Transylvanian counties (and parts of three others) and requested a Hungarian response by November 2. The Hungarian government (after negotiations with the council) rejected the proposal, claiming that it failed to secure the rights of the ethnic Hungarian and German populations. In Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ([[Alba Iulia]]) on December 1, the [[National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary]] passed a resolution calling for the unification of all Romanians in a single state. The National Council of Transylvanian Germans and the Council of the [[Danube Swabians]] from the [[Banat]] approved the proclamation on 8 January 1919. In response, the Hungarian General Assembly of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsv\u00e1r]] (Cluj) reaffirmed the loyalty of Hungarians from Transylvania to Hungary on December 22, 1918.\n\n[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|Ethnic composition and partition of Hungary after World War I|alt=Green-and-grey map with pie charts]]\nThe Romanian Army, representing the [[Entente powers]], entered Transylvania from the east on November 12, 1918. In December they entered southern Transylvania, crossed the demarcation line on the Maros (Mure\u0219) river by mid-December and advanced to Kolozsv\u00e1r (Cluj) and M\u00e1ramarossziget ([[Sighet]]) after making a request to the Powers of Versailles to protect the Romanians in Transylvania. In February 1919, to prevent armed clashes between Romanian and withdrawing Hungarian troops, a neutral zone was created.\n\nThe prime minister of the newly proclaimed Republic of Hungary resigned in March 1919, refusing the territorial concessions (including Transylvania) demanded by the Entente. When the [[Hungarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] of [[Hungary]] (led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]]) came to power in March 1919, it proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]; after promising that Hungary would regain the lands under its control during the Austro-Hungarian Empire it attacked [[Czechoslovakia]] and Romania, leading to the [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919]]. The Hungarian army began an April 1919 offensive in Transylvania along the [[Some\u0219 River|Some\u0219 (Szamos)]] and [[Mure\u0219 river|Maros]] rivers. A Romanian counter-offensive pushed forward to reach the [[Tisza]] River in May. Another Hungarian offensive in July penetrated 60&nbsp;km into Romanian lines before a further Romanian counter-offensive led to the end of Hungarian Soviet Republic and after the occupation of [[Budapest]]. The Romanian army withdrew from Hungary between October 1919 and March 1920.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]], formally signed in June 1919, recognised the sovereignty of [[Romania]] over Transylvania. The Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St. Germain]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] (June 1920) further defined the status of Transylvania and the new border between the states of Hungary and Romania. [[Ferdinand of Romania|King Ferdinand I of Romania]] and [[Princess Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Maria of Romania]] were crowned at [[Alba Iulia]] in 1922.\n\n[[File:Romania MASSR 1924.png|thumb|left|Great Romania (1918\u20131940)|alt=Yellow, peach and orange map]]\n''Rom\u00e2nia Mare'' (\"Great Romania\") refers to the [[Romania]]n state between the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. [[Romania]] reached its greatest territorial extent, uniting almost all historical Romanian lands (except [[northern Maramure\u0219]], [[Serbian Banat|Western Banat]] and small areas of [[Partium]] and [[Cri\u0219ana]]). Great Romania was an ideal of Romanian [[nationalism]].\n\nAt the end of World War I Transylvania and [[Bessarabia]] were united with the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], the Deputies of Transylvanian Romanians declared the union of Transylvania with Romania in Alba Iulia on 1. December 1918.; Bessarabia, having declared independence from [[Russia]] in 1917 at the Conference of the Country (Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii), called in Romanian troops to protect the province from the [[Bolshevik]]s. The union of the Transylvania, [[Maramure\u0219]], [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Banat]] regions with the Old Kingdom of Romania was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], which recognised the sovereignty of Romania over these regions and settled the border between the Republic of Hungary and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The union of [[Bukovina]] and Bessarabia with Romania was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Romania had also acquired [[Southern Dobrudja]] from [[Bulgaria]] as a result of its victory in the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913.\n\n==={{anchor|Transylvania during World War II and Communism}}World War II and Communist era===\n[[File:Northern Transylvania yellow.png|thumb|Romania in 1940 with [[Northern Transylvania]] highlighted in yellow]]\n[[File:P\u00e9rdidasTerritorialesRumanas1940-ro.svg|thumb|left|Romania's territorial losses in the summer of 1940]]\n\nIn August 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the northern half of Transylvania ([[Northern Transylvania]]) was annexed to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]] by the second [[Second Vienna Award]], leaving [[Southern Transylvania]] to Romania.

The [[Transylvanian Diet|Diet]] of 1659 codified the [[coat of arms]]. While the Hungarians, Saxons and Szeklers are represented the Romanians are not, despite their proposal to include a representation of [[Dacia]].\n\nRegions are not legal administrative units in Romania; consequently, the coat of arms is only used within the [[coat of arms of Romania]]. This officially recognised image is based on the 1659 symbols, and includes the traditional Transylvania estates.\n\nAnother, short-lived heraldic representation of Transylvania is found on the coat of arms of [[Michael the Brave]]. Besides the Wallachian eagle and the Moldavian aurochs, Transylvania is represented by two lions holding a sword (referring to the [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]]) standing on seven hills.\n\nThe 1848 revolutionary movement proposed a revision to the Transylvanian coat of arms, with representation of the Romanian majority. To the 1659 representation it introduced a central section, portraying a [[Dacians|Dacian]] woman (symbolizing the [[Romania]]n nation) holding in her right hand a sickle and in her left a [[Roman legion]]'s flag with the initials \"D.F.\" (''Dacia Felix''). On the woman's right there was an eagle with a laurel crown in its beak, and on its left side a lion. This representation of the Romanian nation was inspired by a coin issued by the Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Marcus Julius Philippus]] at [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]] to honor the province of Dacia.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Historiography===\nThe history of Transylvania has been subject to disagreement between national narratives, especially those of Romania and Hungary.

Currently, only the base and the body parts of the temple remains, while the roof structure is missing, due to the lack of stone parts of the roof remains to be constructed.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n* [[Singhasari temple]]\n* [[Kidal Temple]]\n* [[Jago Temple]]\n* [[Sumberawan]]\n* [[Jawi Temple]]\n* [[Trowulan]]\n* [[Pari Temple]]\n* [[Gunung Gangsir]]\n* [[Jabung]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Candi Badut}}\n* {{in lang|id}} [http://malangsite.net/wisata-sejarah-malang-candi-badut/ Candi Badut and other points of interest in Malang]\n* {{in lang|id}} [http://cityguide.kapanlagi.com/malang/wisata/35637-candi-badut.html Candi Badut in ''CityGuide.KapanLagi.com''']\n\n{{Hindu temples in Indonesia}}\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Indonesia|Badut]]\n[[Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in East Java]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStructure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badut"}

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

Once becoming a Shinkenger, they must renounce their past lives in order to keep their friends and family safe in case a member of the Gedoushu targets them. The Shiba House's manor is protected by a barrier of the Modikara {{nihongo|\"protect\"|\u5b88|mamoru}}, keeping the Shinkengers safe.

He was raised since childhood by Hikoma Kusakabe to act the role of the 18th head of the Shiba House after his father gave him the Sisi Origami. His upbringing made him create a facade to look very arrogant and proud to others, claiming none can match his strength and greatness, while keeping his cool in any situation. Though he was reluctant to have the vassals fight by his side, as he wanted no one else to bear the burden, he allowed their involvement after giving them the choice to turn back or become Shinkengers out of want rather than need, as long as they are willing to finish their mission to the last detail. By the time Genta arrives, Takeru's facade is revealed as he now questions himself of how it makes him strong along with learning he shares similar attributes with Juzo before defeating him. While at times it may not appear so, Takeru does cares greatly for his vassals and when Genta arrives, he becomes more open with them. However, in a fight against Juzo, it is revealed that Takeru started to value his life more which, in Juzo's opinion, makes him weaker and makes Takeru doubt himself. In reality, Takeru has been acting as a {{nihongo3||\u5f71\u6b66\u8005|kagemusha|{{r|group=Note|Kagemusha}}}} for the true 18th head of the Shiba Clan, Kaoru, who was not yet born at the time of her father's death, having been chosen for his proficiency with Modikara and his swordsmanship. When Kaoru is injured while attempting to use the Sealing Character on Doukoku, she formally adopts Takeru, making him the 19th head of the Shiba House. After defeating Doukoku in the final battle, Takeru says goodbye to Kaoru and his vassals and stays in the Shiba House with Hikoma, resuming his days now as a true samurai, though it is implied that he remains in contact with his friends. As Hikoma insists that Takeru should start learning new things instead of just working as a samurai (such as playing the [[guitar]] or learning conversational [[English language|English]]), he stands by the front door of the Shiba House, recalling his moments as Shinken Red.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Red|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Shinken Reddo}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]\"|\u706b\u306e\u4f8d|Hi no Samurai}} and can use the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Red|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Reddo}} or the Kyoryu Disk to become {{nihongo|Hyper Shinken Red|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Haip\u0101 Shinken Reddo}}.

Due to his parents' upbringing, he is extremely enthusiastic and takes his role as Takeru's vassal seriously. Ryunosuke is also the engineer behind many of the Samurai Combinations, having figured out how to combine the Origami into Tenku-Shinkenoh and later into Samuraihaoh. He is initially unreceptive towards Genta, who he once called a \"wannabe\" samurai. As such, Ryunosuke is typically the one to lead the other vassals in Takeru's absence. When Kaoru reveals herself, Ryunosuke becomes confused about whom to follow, because he had pledged his life to the head of the Shiba family. After he receives some advice that clears his mind, he pledges his life to Takeru Shiba. After the final battle, Ryunosuke gives Takeru a kabuki-styled farewell dance and goes back to work as a kabuki actor.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Blue|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|Shinken Bur\u016b}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Water (classical element)|Water]]\"|\u6c34\u306e\u4f8d|Mizu no Samurai}} and can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Blue|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Bur\u016b}}.\n\nRyunosuke is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Hiroki Aiba]]|\u76f8\u8449 \u5f18\u6a39|Aiba Hiroki}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/04.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Takumi Horikiri|\u5800\u5207 \u62d3\u6d77|Horikiri Takumi}}.\n\n====Mako Shiraishi====\n{{nihongo|'''Mako Shiraishi'''|\u767d\u77f3 \u8309\u5b50|Shiraishi Mako}} is a strong-willed girl who fights for her ideals. She loves children and worked at a kindergarten prior to becoming a Shinkenger. When she was a little girl, her childhood was pushed aside when her parents moved to [[Hawaii]] without a word and left her in the care of her grandmother, who schooled her in the ways of bushid\u014d. Chiaki and Kotoha both regard her as an older sister figure; Chiaki even addresses her as such. Though she is a horrible cook (none of the boys can stomach her cooking), Mako tries her best in order to achieve her dream of becoming a good wife and mother. Eventually, Mako is reunited with her parents and learns that her mother had become paralyzed from the waist down as a result of her tenure as the previous Shinken Pink. After the reunion and reconciliation with her mother, Mako gains a newfound conviction to defeat the Gedoushu. Because of her gentle nature, she can read other people well, especially Takeru, and readily gives her opinion regarding the situation in question. After the final battle, Mako goes to Hawaii to live with her parents.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Pink|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30af|Shinken Pinku}}, she is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Air (classical element)|Sky]]\"|\u5929\u306e\u4f8d|Ten no Samurai}}, can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Pink|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30af|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Pinku}}, and can perform the {{nihongo|Pink Double Attack|\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30af|Pinku Daburu Atakku}} with Gosei Pink in ''Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku''.\n\nMako is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Rin Takanashi]]|\u9ad8\u68a8 \u81e8|Takanashi Rin}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/01.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, she is portrayed by {{nihongo|Marina Nakajima|\u4e2d\u5cf6 \u307e\u308a\u306a|Nakajima Marina}}.\n\n====Chiaki Tani====\n{{nihongo|'''Chiaki Tani'''|\u8c37 \u5343\u660e|Tani Chiaki}} is a lazy, irresponsible, selfish, and arrogant rebel. Initially, Chiaki had no interest in becoming Takeru's vassal and often clashed with him. The only reason he even worked with Takeru was because he thought it would be fun and he wanted to protect people. He is a great strategist despite his delinquency, and comes to respect Takeru as a rival when he realizes the limits of his own abilities, pledging to pass Takeru in skill someday. Chiaki was without his mother from an early age and was raised solely by his father, who planted in him the seed of his interest in martial arts. Despite not being formally trained, he is an excellent strategist and adept with surprise attacks, thanks to his imagination and free-spiritedness. When Genta arrives, Chiaki is the first to accept him into the team. Chiaki is very protective of Kotoha and seems to be uncomfortable when Genta's friend shows an interest in her. Even though he often butts heads with Ryunosuke, Chiaki respects him immensely for his skill; in fact, they work together so well that they become able to perform tasks in sync with one another. During time off from his duties, or when he is troubled, he often plays ''[[Tekken 6|Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion]]''. He prefers American surf wear and skate wear brands like [[Vans]] and especially Gotcha, whose vintage shirts he wears in most episodes. After the final battle, Chiaki plans to take his college entrance exams.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Green|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|Shinken Gur\u012bn}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Wood (classical element)|Wood]]\"|\u6728\u306e\u4f8d|Ki no Samurai}} and can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Green|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Gur\u012bn}} or the Kyoryu Disk to become {{nihongo|Hyper Shinken Green|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|Haip\u0101 Shinken Gur\u012bn}}.\n\nChiaki is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Shogo Suzuki (actor)|Shogo Suzuki]]|\u9234\u6728 \u52dd\u543e|Suzuki Sh\u014dgo}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/02.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>\n\n====Kotoha Hanaori====\n{{nihongo|'''Kotoha Hanaori'''|\u82b1\u7e54 \u3053\u3068\u306f|Hanaori Kotoha}} is a clumsy and gentle girl who worked in a bamboo shop and speaks with a {{nihongo|[[Kyoto]] accent|\u4eac\u90fd\u5f01|Ky\u014dtoben}}. Very much a crybaby as a child, she is close to her older sister, Mitsuba, who had been training to be Shinken Yellow. When Mitsuba became ill and unable to serve as Takeru's vassal, Kotoha stepped up to take her place. Kotoha is deeply respectful of Takeru and wants to help him in any way she can. She has rather low self-esteem; she genuinely believes that she is stupid (she claims that the only things that she is proficient at are her swordsmanship and her flute playing) and, despite her teammates' affection for her, often feels that she is a bother to them. She idolizes Mako and strives to become more like her. Kotoha often suggests that if Mitsuba never fell ill, the Shinkengers as a whole would probably be much stronger. However, her spirits are raised after she receives a letter from Mitsuba, in which Mitsuba says that Kotoha is the true Shinken Yellow. She never wears long pants and prefers to wear short shorts with knee socks. After the final battle, Kotoha returns home to Mitsuba.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Yellow|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|Shinken Ier\u014d}}, she is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]\"|\u571f\u306e\u4f8d|Tsuchi no Samurai}} and can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Yellow|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Ier\u014d}}.\n\nKotoha is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Suzuka Morita]]|\u68ee\u7530 \u6dbc\u82b1|Morita Suzuka}}, who later portrayed Shelly in ''[[Space Sheriff Gavan: The Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/05.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, she is portrayed by {{nihongo|Ayu Matsuura|\u677e\u6d66 \u611b\u5f13|Matsuura Ayu}}.\n\n====Genta Umemori====\n{{nihongo|'''Genta Umemori'''|\u6885\u76db \u6e90\u592a|Umemori Genta}} is the son of a [[sushi]] chef who mysteriously disappeared prior to the beginning of the series, and a childhood friend of Takeru's. As a child, Genta often meddled in Takeru's training, which annoyed Hikoma greatly. Genta promised to help Takeru become a samurai, and in return, Takeru entrusted him with the Ika Disk. Years later, he is shown to have inherited the {{nihongo|Gold Zushi|\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u5bff\u53f8|G\u014drudo Zushi}} sushi cart and to have developed his own {{nihongo|\"Electronic Modikara\"|\u96fb\u5b50\u30e2\u30c2\u30ab\u30e9|Denshi Mojikara}}, using the Sushi Changer to [[Japanese input methods|type the kanji needed]]. The other Shinkengers are initially suspicious of Genta until he makes his formal introduction as Shinken Gold. Though Takeru is reluctant at first, he eventually allows Genta to fulfill his promise and join the team. Genta considers himself Takeru's best friend, despite their personalities being complete opposites; Genta is as hyperactive and expressive as much as Takeru is reserved and stoic. When Kaoru reveals herself, Genta immediately disapproves of her because of his relationship with Takeru, but later accepts her when he sees that she is very kind. After the final battle, Genta leaves to open a restaurant with DaiGoyou in [[Paris]] in hopes of fulfilling his lifelong dream of receiving a three-star rating by the ''[[Michelin Guide]]''.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Gold|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Shinken G\u014drudo}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of Light\"|\u5149\u306e\u4f8d|Hikari no Samurai}} and uses sushi-themed accouterments to transform and battle, like exploding [[chopsticks]] that he uses as a projectile weapon. He is considered a genius in using Modikara and is also one of the few who can use Modikara to create Origami, as well as being the only one in the group able to complete the Inromaru. After the Shinkengers defeat an Ayakashi in battle, Shinken Gold encourages everyone to do a victory clap before Shinken Red's ending catch phrase. In the special DVD ''The Light Samurai's Surprise Transformation'', Genta uses the Kyoryu Disk to transform from Shinken Gold into {{nihongo|Hyper Shinken Gold|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Haip\u0101 Shinken G\u014drudo}}.

She is referred to by her vassals and servants as {{nihongo|Princess|\u59eb|Hime}}. As the head of the Shiba House, Kaoru is the one who possesses the knowledge of the {{nihongo|Sealing Character|\u5c01\u5370\u306e\u6587\u5b57|F\u016bin no Moji}} also known as the {{nihongo|Gedou Seal|\u5916\u9053\u5c01\u5370|Ged\u014d F\u016bin}}, a Modikara passed along the Shiba bloodline (the kanji is fictional, but is composed of the kanji for {{nihongo3|\"Gate\"|\u9580|Mon}}, {{nihongo3|\"Sub-\"|\u4e9e|A}}, {{nihongo3|\"Sword\"|\u5263|Ken}}, and {{nihongo3|\"Flame\"|\u708e|Hon\u014d}}). Because of this, she stayed in hiding while Takeru acted as her ''kagemusha'' to draw the Gedoushu away from her. When she grows tired of living in hiding, she masters the Sealing Character to defeat the Gedoushu and assumes her birthright. Even though she is kind and easy to work with, she underestimates the vassals' dedication to Takeru, and when she is injured in attempting to use the Sealing Character, she adopts Takeru and gives up her birthright to allow Takeru to lead the Shinkengers in defeating Doukoku. She makes another appearance in ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku]]'', combining her Modikara with [[Goseigers#Alata|Alata]]'s Gosei Power to create the Kaentornado card, which is used to free Takeru from his Gedou Shinken Red form, and allow all the Shinkengers to utilize the Super Shinkenger form.\n\nLike Takeru, Kaoru is the \"Samurai of Fire\" and has the ability to become Shinken Red, referred to as {{nihongo|Princess Shinken Red|\u59eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Hime Shinken Reddo}} to differentiate with Takeru's Shinken Red, and use the Inromaru to transform into Super Shinken Red. Her secret training allows her to easily adopt all of the weaponry the others had used before her appearance.\n\nKaoru is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Runa Natsui]]|\u590f\u5c45 \u7460\u5948|Natsui Runa}}.\n\n===Hikoma Kusakabe===\n{{nihongo|Hikoma Kusakabe|\u65e5\u4e0b\u90e8 \u5f66\u99ac|Kusakabe Hikoma}} is Takeru's retainer and guardian. He also serves as the Shinkengers' mentor; it is he who gathered the four vassals when the Gedoushu revived. The Shinkengers affectionately call him {{nihongo|\"Jii\"|\u30b8\u30a4||translated as \"old man\" or \"samurai\"}}. Every year, he gets one day off, which he uses to visit his wife's grave and visit his daughter and granddaughter. His relationship with Takeru and his vassals runs deep; he takes great care to ensure that they are safe and that they are ready to fight, and he supplies them with information and weaponry. Though Genta frequently annoys him, Hikoma acknowledges the younger man's skill with Modikara and eventually does accept and connect with him. Like Mako, he is adept at reading people and often helps the vassals with their personal problems. When he goes to a hospital to be treated for a hip injury, he happens upon the [[List of Kamen Rider Decade characters#Hikari Studio|Hikari Studio]] and gives invaluable advice to Tsukasa Kadoya during the meeting of the worlds of ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' and ''Samurai Sentai Shinkenger''. While Hikoma does not typically take up arms himself, his \"battle\" is to ensure that Takeru and his vassals remain safe and will always have someplace to which they can return. When Kaoru makes her appearance, Hikoma remains loyal to Takeru, but bears no ill will towards Kaoru; he respects her for both her title and for the kind and diligent young woman that she is. After the final battle, he stays with Takeru even when he insists that he go visit his family and encourages Takeru to join him to experience other lifestyles other than just the samurai life.\n\nHikoma is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Goro Ibuki]]|\u4f0a\u5439 \u543e\u90ce|Ibuki Gor\u014d}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/06.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Kuroko===\nThe {{nihongo|[[kuroko]]|\u9ed2\u5b50}} are the Shiba House's servants who, like their namesakes, \"set up\" the scene during the Shinkengers' transformation. As they do not possess Modikara proficiency, they are not able to fight against the Gedoushu physically and as such, they are not directly involved in combat, although they do help evacuate civilians away from danger. They are skilled in many comparatively mundane things and are tasked with doing household chores, and help citizens in the nearby town to the best of their ability, when the Shinkengers are not in battle. Kaoru has her own group of Kuroko, who wear slightly different robes bearing the Shiba family crest.\n\n===Allies===\n* {{nihongo|Takeru's Father|\u4e08\u7460\u306e\u7236|Takeru no Chichi|1, 12, 46}}: He gave young Takeru the Sisi Origami and died.

After the previous head of the Shiba House died, Sakutaro lost his will to continue as a servant of the Shiba House and took to the life of a fisherman. However, meeting Ryunosuke opens Sakutaro's eyes to the reason why he had served the Shiba House as he helps Ryunosuke in obtaining the Kajiki Origami. He later secretly resumes his duty as a kuroko; he helps Ryunosuke through his own crisis of confidence, and gives Kaoru a larger fan with which she can put Tanba in his place. Sakutaro Komatsu is portrayed by {{nihongo|Gotaro Tsunashima|\u7db1\u5cf6 \u90f7\u592a\u90ce|Tsunashima G\u014dtar\u014d}}.\n* {{nihongo|Richard Brown|\u30ea\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3|Rich\u0101do Buraun|14}}: Richard Brown is a foreigner who comes to idolize the Shinkengers after he is cured of the Yamiororo Poison in Act 7. He approaches Ryunosuke and asks to become his pupil in the ways of bushid\u014d. Although Ryunosuke tries to deter Mr. Brown from becoming a samurai, his attempts fail and Ryunosuke is nearly killed after he must rescue Mr. Brown after a failed attack on Hachouchin. After Ryunosuke recovers and Mr. Brown reminds the other Shinkengers of the spirit of being a samurai, they defeat Hachouchin and Mr. Brown returns to his homeland to teach bushid\u014d to his fellow citizens.

He was supposed to teach Chiaki the ways of bushid\u014d, but instead of putting Chiaki through rigorous training, raised him to be a cheerful boy. In reality, his way of life was meant to inspire Chiaki to become a samurai on his own, rather than be conditioned into the role.

Now a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]], Mamoru had brought her with him to Hawaii to aid in her recovery. Though she left Mako without a word, Kyoko had never stopped thinking about her daughter.

Arrogant and fiercely loyal to Kaoru, he is highly contemptuous of Takeru and, by extension, Hikoma, and demands that the Shinkengers support Kaoru without question. Tanba often speaks candidly without thinking, which sometimes annoys Kaoru; she hits him in the back of the head with a fan to express her displeasure on these occasions.

They spin the kanji around and then it forms the suit around them. The Shodo Phone is also used in summoning the [[#Origami|Origami]] and combining the Origami into a [[#Samurai Giants|Samurai Giant]]. The Shodo Phone can also be used to summon other items with the proper kanji (and the proper stroke order, as Chiaki learns the hard way). One example is when Takeru exhibits this ability by summoning his steed after writing the kanji for {{nihongo|\"horse\"|\u99ac|uma}} in the air.\n* {{nihongo|Shinkenmaru|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30de\u30eb}}: The Shinkenmaru is the Shinkengers' primary sidearm.

By spinning that Secret Disk, the Shinkenmaru acts as a [[praxinoscope]] and it powers up depending on the disk itself. By spinning the Common Secret Disks fast enough, the Shinkenmaru transforms into the Shinkengers' signature weapon. Using a personal Secret Disk allows a Shinkenger to execute a {{nihongo|Spiral Sword|\u87ba\u65cb\u4e4b\u592a\u5200|Rasen no Tachi}} attack depending on the element that the disk represents.

The Gedoshu maintain their wretched existence with the water of the Sanzu, and in order to maintain the river's levels, they constantly enter into the human world with the intent of running amok in order to feed the river with negative emotions of humans. If a Gedoshu spends too long in the human world, it eventually dries out, and petrifies if it can not return to the Sanzu.  Cursed to be in a state between life and death, a Gedoushu can only be free of its existence if it is slain upon taking its Second Life, or if it is able to let go of the [[up\u0101d\u0101na]] that damned it in the first place.\n\nThe Gedoushu under Doukoku reside on the {{nihongo|[[Six realms|Rokumon]] [[Junk (ship)|Junk]]|\u516d\u9580\u8239|Rokumonsen}} that sails along the Sanzu River. Others spend their time within the River itself until Doukoku or some other powerful being calls them. Using their ability to enter the living world through cracks and narrow gaps, Doukoku's minions set up a plan to terrorize humans in any way possible so that the river overflows to point of flooding into the mortal realm in order for them to invade in full fury. The Gedoushu can also become powerful during the time of [[Bon Festival]].\n\n===Doukoku===\n{{nihongo|Doukoku Chimatsuri|\u8840\u796d \u30c9\u30a6\u30b3\u30af|Chimatsuri D\u014dkoku|{{r|group=Note|Chimatsuri}}}} (1-40 & 47-49) is the leader of the Gedoushu and is armed with the {{nihongo|Sh\u014dry\u016b Bakuzant\u014d|\u6607\u7adc\u629c\u5c71\u5200||Rising Dragon Mountain-Removing Sword}}, the {{nihongo|K\u014dry\u016b Gaiseit\u014d|\u964d\u7adc\u84cb\u4e16\u5200||Descending Dragon World-Covering Sword}}, and possessing the power to seal his fellow Gedoushu. He is in a constant state of rage, originally endless until he heard the sound of Usuyuki's shamisen, becoming obsessed with her as he later takes her upon her rebirth into Dayu to soothe his rage along with [[sake]]. He targeted the Shiba House's previous Shinkengers, making it his goal to completely eliminate the Shiba House so no one would be able to stop him. However, while fighting the seventeenth head of the Shiba House, he was sealed away as the previous Shinken Red died. This seal was incomplete, and Doukoku was able to revive by the time of the next generation. To reach his goal again, Doukoku sends out Ayakashi to terrorize humans so the Sanzu River can overflow its banks into the mortal realm and enable him to unleash his full fury. This method of attack was later revealed to how he loses the rejuvenating qualities of its waters much faster than any other member of the Gedoushu and takes longer to soak the river's waters back into his body.\n\nLearning of the seal placed on him, Doukoku briefly changes his plans to target Takeru as the death of the Shiba House would ensure that he would never be sealed again. But when that plan failed, Doukoku has his force carry on the original plan without giving wind of this knowledge to any Ayakashi with his own agenda. During the summer while in a comatose state that leaves him open to his enemies, Doukoku manages to suppress his magnified power. Later, after learning of Akamaro's true colors, Doukoku risks his life to enter the mortal realm to repair Dayu's shamisen after driving off Akumaro and defeating Shinken Red. As a result, he has to be submerged in the Sanzu River to rehydrate. But after the Shiba Clan true's eighteenth head is revealed, Doukoku's followers attempt to speed up his awakening by increasing the amount of suffering until Dayu uses Shinza's anguish to bring Doukoku back to the mortal realm. After absorbing Dayu's energy to heal his body, Doukoku gains immunity to the Sealing Character and can now endure being in the mortal realm without drying up. As a result, Doukoku overpowers the Shinkengers before bringing the Rokumon Junk into the mortal realm when the Sanzu River floods the city. Thinking he had broken the Shinkengers' spirits when they attempt to defeat him, Doukoku is immobilized before Shinken Blue delivers the final blow. Assuming his second life, Doukoku overpowers Samuraihaoh, blasting it and throwing off its components until only Shinkenoh remains, then impales it on his sword. However, the Shinkengers take advantage of the events and mortally wound him before he explodes. He attempts to take the Shinkengers down with him, but this fails as they survive the explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/12.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Doukoku is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Vai\u015brava\u1e47a]]|[[:ja:\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929|\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929]]|Bishamonten}} and a [[Japanese spiny lobster]].<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nDoukoku is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Rintar\u014d Nishi]]|\u897f \u51db\u592a\u6717|Nishi Rintar\u014d}}, who previously portrayed Shadam in ''[[Gosei Sentai Dairanger]]''.\n\n===Tayu===\n{{nihongo|Tayu Usukawa|\u8584\u76ae \u592a\u592b|Usukawa Day\u016b|{{r|group=Note|Dayu}}}} (1-48) is Doukoku's right hand and the only one he is kind to, provided she knows her place as his obedient, unquestioning servant. Doukoku takes her in after her rebirth as a Gedoushu, giving her the name she now goes by and telling her that she has nowhere else to go but to him. But her unique origins set her apart from normal Gedoshu as she can move freely in the mortal realm. In life, she was {{nihongo|Usuyuki|\u8584\u96ea}} a [[shamisen]] player who obsessed over a man named Shinza. Scorned that he loved another woman instead of her, Usuyuki set fire to the building holding his wedding ceremony, killing him, his bride, and the entirety of their wedding party, in a suicidal [[crime of passion]]. Seeing that her love would remain unrequited to the bitter end, Usuyuki's emotions corrupt her soul and caused her rebirth into Tayu. The transformation also forcefully bonded Shinza's soul into the shamisen that Tayu carries with her, creating the eerie and unsettling songs that serve to soothe Doukoku's rage. The shamisen's [[headstock]] also doubles as the hilt of a [[shortsword]] Tayu uses in battle.\n\nOf all the Gedoushu, Tayu has the most trouble getting along with the Ayakashi because of her previous life as a human, which she makes attempts to reclaim. One failed attempt results with her being saved by Juzo, developing feelings for the Gedounin as she begins to defy Doukoku's orders with her shamisen damaged as a result. Though her feelings for Shinza had long died, Tayu refuses to give him up as it would end her existence and desires to know the purpose behind it. Leaving Doukoku, Tayu wanders aimlessly until she is found by Akumaro who recruits her to his group in return for her instrument's restoration. Until it is repaired, she has to rely on the {{nihongo|Sange Hankont\u014d|\u6563\u83ef\u6591\u75d5\u5200||Glorious Death Spotted-Scars Sword}} dagger in her fights. Upon learning that Akamaro never intended to repair her instrument, she attempts to reclaim her shamisen until Dokouku comes to her aid, using a piece of his body to restore the shamisen and reminding her of her place by his side. Soon after Akumaro's demise, Tayu returns to the Rokumon Junk to assist in Doukoku's reawakening. To that end, after finally having the answers to her questions, Tayu deliberately has Shinken Pink destroy her shamisen to not only discard her past life, but to also use Shinza's anguished soul to revive Doukoku. She later uses the last of her powers to restore Doukoku's body, giving him immunity to the Sealing Character and independence from the Sanzu River. With only her kimono remaining, Doukoku later throws it into the Sanzu River as a final respect to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/11.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Tayu is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Benzaiten]]|[[:ja:\u5f01\u624d\u5929|\u5f01\u8ca1\u5929]]}}, a [[Nudibranch|sea slug]], and various [[mollusca|molluscs]]<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/> and has elements of the {{nihongo|[[futakuchi-onna]]|[[:ja:\u4e8c\u53e3\u5973|\u4e8c\u53e3\u5973]]}}.\n\nBecause of the nature of [[rendaku]] in Japanese, her name is only Usukawa Dayu when it is said in full; otherwise, it is Tayu.

Shitari sees humans as mere specimens for his research, uncovering means to overflow the Sanzu River. He also possessed texts from the Shiba House which he used to learn about the seal placed on Doukoku. Though he warns Doukoku not to trouble himself with the Shiba House's sealing character so not to attract attention from certain Ayakashi, Shitari recruits Isagitsune in an attempt to slake his curiosity on what the sealing character is. He later recruits Oinogare in an attempt to re-open a well the Gedoushu used in the past as their base of operations by sacrificing nine maidens, formally introducing himself to the Shinkengers as a result.\n\nWhile Doukoku is in a vulnerable state struggling with his surging power, the rogue Ayakashi Gozunagumo bullies Shitari into extorting the sealing character from Shinken Red. Despite poisoning Takeru, Shitari fails to get him to reveal the sealing character due to the combined interference of Shinken Gold and Juzo. When Doukoku revives and punishes Gozunagumo, Shitari freely confesses that the one thing he values above Doukoku is his own life and gains forgiveness from his leader out of amusement with his honesty. During the events of ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' episodes 24 and 25, Shitari witnesses Daiki Kaitoh stealing the Ika Origami and sends the Ayakashi Chinomanako to investigate the otherworldly [[Kamen Rider Diend]], causing the chain of events that would doom their world. When Akumaro arrives, Shitari expresses a great deal of distrust over the mysterious Gedoushu and not as much shocked when his impression of him was accurate yet was powerless to do anything against him as he realized Akumaro's intentions. After Dayu returns, Shitari decides to kill off Takeru, only to learn the truth behind him and the Shiba House's true leader and giving up one half of his life, in an attempt to speed up Doukoku's reawakening at the cost of having no second life should he be killed. He remains on the Rokumon Junk during Doukoku's final battle with the Shinkengers, going down with the ship as it sinks in response to its master's death while proclaiming that he will survive regardless of what happens.\n\nShitari later returns in ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku]]'', becoming Buredoran's right hand servant until learning his plan to drain the Sanzu River and refusing to go along with it. But during the climatic battle, gathering an army of followers to kill Buredoran and reclaim the Sanzu River, Shitari ends up facing the [[Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger|Gokaigers]] when they traveled from the near future and they mistakenly believe him to be a hindrance in their own affairs{{r|group=Note|Gokaigers}}. With his army ultimately devastated, Shitari is destroyed by Gokai Red using the [[Go-ongers#S\u014dsuke Esumi|Go-On Red Ranger Key]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/13.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Shitari is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Fukurokuju]]|[[:ja:\u798f\u7984\u5bff|\u798f\u7984\u5bff]]}} and a [[squid]].<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nShitari is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Ch\u014d]]|\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc}}.\n\n===Juzo===\n{{nihongo|Juzo Fuwa|\u8151\u7834 \u5341\u81d3|Fuwa J\u016bz\u014d|{{r|group=Note|Juzo}}}} (7-47) is a mysterious Gedoushu, regarded by the others as a lone wolf, yet he seems to know more than Doukoku about the Sanzu River's true potential. 200 years ago, Fuwa was a samurai in life who made a living as an assassin, disenchanted with the ways of [[bushid\u014d]] and thriving more on the pleasure of killing his opponents in battle until he can no longer be physically able to wield a sword. He meets Akumaro who provides him with the katana {{nihongo|Uramasa|\u88cf\u6b63||\"[[Injustice]]\"}}, seemingly unaware that the blade was forged from the souls of his family who tried to free him from his blood lust. When he contracts a fatal illness, Fuwa enters the Sanzu River to cheat death, completely discarding the goodness in his heart to become a {{nihongo|Gedounin|\u5916\u9053\u4eba|Ged\u014dnin}}, a half-Gedoushu that can freely exist in both realms and assume a human form. However, unlike other Gedounin who die out in a few years, Fuwa endured over the centuries and thus is condemned with an insatiable urge to find an ideal opponent, a fellow samurai who strays from the teachings of bushid\u014d, to clash blades with. As a result, Fuwa mistakes the blade's cries of sadness for an equal lust for battle, believing that the souls of his family have lost their desire to stop him after he entered the Sanzu River.\n    \nHe finds this opponent in Takeru Shiba, after witnessing his sword fighting as Shinken Red. This obsession with fighting Shinken Red leads Doukoku to seal Fuwa's Gedoushu powers, leaving him for dead in the Sanzu River. Although he barely survives with Dayu's aid, he continues to defy Doukoku by making sure that Takeru is at his strongest for their next fight, even curing him of Shitari's poisoning. After a long battle in which he manages to severely wound Shinken Red, Fuwa is defeated and falls off the cliff into the ocean below. However, Fuwa survives with Uramasa's blade snapped in half. He remains in the mountainside until Dayu finds him and relays Akumaro's offer to work for him in return for restoring his blade. To his chagrin, he has to rely on the replacement {{nihongo|Bant\u014d Dokuh\u014dmatsu|\u86ee\u5200\u6bd2\u6ce1\u6cab||Barbarian Sword Poisonous Bubbles}} that hampers his normal fighting style. Later fed up waiting for the Uramasa to be repaired, Fuwa confronts Akumaro and learns his weapon's origins and that he is a pawn in Akumaro's plan. However, tricking Akumaro into giving him back his weapon and cutting him down, Fuwa reveals he knew the truth behind Uramasa from the first time he held it, thus preventing Akumaro from fulfilling his plan. Later, after the real Shiba House head is revealed, Fuwa gets Takeru to duel him once again before finally falling to him in battle with a delayed hit after Uramasa finally stops its master and denies him his only desire. Uramasa remains in the physical world after Fuwa fades away until the souls that formed it are finally able to depart into the afterlife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/16.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> Juzo is modeled after the {{nihongo|[[Sh\u014dj\u014d]]|[[:ja:\u7329\u7329|\u7329\u7329]]}} of Japanese myth (It replaced {{nihongo|[[Jur\u014djin]]|[[:ja:\u5bff\u8001\u4eba|\u5bff\u8001\u4eba]]}} and was sometimes depicted).<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nFuwa is portrayed and voiced by {{nihongo|[[Mitsuru Karahashi]]|\u5510\u6a4b \u5145|Karahashi Mitsuru}}, who previously portrayed Naoya Kaido/Snake [[Orphnoch]] in ''[[Kamen Rider 555]]'', Makage/Kagemaru in ''[[Lion Maru G]]'', and Grande in ''[[Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: Never Ending Odyssey]]''.\n\n===Akumaro===\n{{nihongo|Akumaro Sujigarano|\u7b4b\u6bbb \u30a2\u30af\u30de\u30ed|Sujigarano Akumaro|27-43,{{r|group=Note|Akumaro}}}} is a Gedoushu general with six slitted eyes and [[risus sardonicus|rictus grin]], whose ambition is to see [[Diyu|Hell]] and savor the immense suffering that it holds.

But when Doukoku's power burst revives him, he offers his services to Doukoku as gratitude. However, Doukoku strikes him near his left shoulder, ultimately creating a vulnerable spot. While pretending to aid Dokoku's group in raising the levels of the Sanzu River, taking any abuse from Doukoku to keep up his act, Akumaro starts setting up markers and recruits Juzo and Dayu into his service to make use of them. Eventually found out to be using Doukoku for his own agenda, Akumaro falls back after Doukoku nearly destroys him. However, with Doukoku resting, Akumaro takes the Rokumon Junk as his own while making the finishing touches on his master plan by completing the final marker to open up Hell and finishing Uramasa's repairs. Although he comes close to his goal, Akumaro is left with nothing when he realizes Juzo can not complete the Urami Gand\u014dgaeshi and goes into an enraged fury before the Shinkengers use the Rekka Daizantou and Super Mougyu Bazooka to slay him. After becoming a giant, Akumaro battles the Samurai Giants and DaiGoyou with his Kirigami before Samuraihaoh uses the Kyoryu Origami to form Super SamuraiHaOh and destroy him, with Akumaro laughing as his desire to see Hell is finally granted with his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/18.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref> Akumaro is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]|[[:ja:\u3048\u3073\u3059|\u3048\u3073\u3059]]}} and a [[shachihoko]] of Japanese myth.<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nAkumaro is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Ry\u014d Horikawa]]|\u5800\u5ddd \u308a\u3087\u3046|Horikawa Ry\u014d}}.\n\n===Manpuku===\n{{nihongo|Manpuku Aburame|\u8102\u76ee \u30de\u30f3\u30d7\u30af|Aburame Manpuku|{{r|group=Note|Manpuku}}}} is the main antagonist in ''[[Samurai Sentai Shinkenger The Movie: The Fateful War]]'', the leader of the {{nihongo|Kusare Gedoushu|\u30af\u30b5\u30ec\u5916\u9053\u8846|Kusare Ged\u014dsh\u016b|{{r|group=Note|Kusare}}}} a group of powerful Gedoushu that exudes a corpse-like stench that was sealed away three centuries ago by Retsudou Shiba.

He was raised since childhood by Hikoma Kusakabe to act the role of the 18th head of the Shiba House after his father gave him the Sisi Origami. His upbringing made him create a facade to look very arrogant and proud to others, claiming none can match his strength and greatness, while keeping his cool in any situation. Though he was reluctant to have the vassals fight by his side, as he wanted no one else to bear the burden, he allowed their involvement after giving them the choice to turn back or become Shinkengers out of want rather than need, as long as they are willing to finish their mission to the last detail. By the time Genta arrives, Takeru's facade is revealed as he now questions himself of how it makes him strong along with learning he shares similar attributes with Juzo before defeating him. While at times it may not appear so, Takeru does cares greatly for his vassals and when Genta arrives, he becomes more open with them. However, in a fight against Juzo, it is revealed that Takeru started to value his life more which, in Juzo's opinion, makes him weaker and makes Takeru doubt himself. In reality, Takeru has been acting as a {{nihongo3||\u5f71\u6b66\u8005|kagemusha|{{r|group=Note|Kagemusha}}}} for the true 18th head of the Shiba Clan, Kaoru, who was not yet born at the time of her father's death, having been chosen for his proficiency with Modikara and his swordsmanship. When Kaoru is injured while attempting to use the Sealing Character on Doukoku, she formally adopts Takeru, making him the 19th head of the Shiba House. After defeating Doukoku in the final battle, Takeru says goodbye to Kaoru and his vassals and stays in the Shiba House with Hikoma, resuming his days now as a true samurai, though it is implied that he remains in contact with his friends. As Hikoma insists that Takeru should start learning new things instead of just working as a samurai (such as playing the [[guitar]] or learning conversational [[English language|English]]), he stands by the front door of the Shiba House, recalling his moments as Shinken Red.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Red|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Shinken Reddo}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]\"|\u706b\u306e\u4f8d|Hi no Samurai}} and can use the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Red|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Reddo}} or the Kyoryu Disk to become {{nihongo|Hyper Shinken Red|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Haip\u0101 Shinken Reddo}}.

Due to his parents' upbringing, he is extremely enthusiastic and takes his role as Takeru's vassal seriously. Ryunosuke is also the engineer behind many of the Samurai Combinations, having figured out how to combine the Origami into Tenku-Shinkenoh and later into Samuraihaoh. He is initially unreceptive towards Genta, who he once called a \"wannabe\" samurai. As such, Ryunosuke is typically the one to lead the other vassals in Takeru's absence. When Kaoru reveals herself, Ryunosuke becomes confused about whom to follow, because he had pledged his life to the head of the Shiba family. After he receives some advice that clears his mind, he pledges his life to Takeru Shiba. After the final battle, Ryunosuke gives Takeru a kabuki-styled farewell dance and goes back to work as a kabuki actor.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Blue|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|Shinken Bur\u016b}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Water (classical element)|Water]]\"|\u6c34\u306e\u4f8d|Mizu no Samurai}} and can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Blue|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Bur\u016b}}.\n\nRyunosuke is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Hiroki Aiba]]|\u76f8\u8449 \u5f18\u6a39|Aiba Hiroki}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/04.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Takumi Horikiri|\u5800\u5207 \u62d3\u6d77|Horikiri Takumi}}.\n\n====Mako Shiraishi====\n{{nihongo|'''Mako Shiraishi'''|\u767d\u77f3 \u8309\u5b50|Shiraishi Mako}} is a strong-willed girl who fights for her ideals. She loves children and worked at a kindergarten prior to becoming a Shinkenger. When she was a little girl, her childhood was pushed aside when her parents moved to [[Hawaii]] without a word and left her in the care of her grandmother, who schooled her in the ways of bushid\u014d. Chiaki and Kotoha both regard her as an older sister figure; Chiaki even addresses her as such. Though she is a horrible cook (none of the boys can stomach her cooking), Mako tries her best in order to achieve her dream of becoming a good wife and mother. Eventually, Mako is reunited with her parents and learns that her mother had become paralyzed from the waist down as a result of her tenure as the previous Shinken Pink. After the reunion and reconciliation with her mother, Mako gains a newfound conviction to defeat the Gedoushu. Because of her gentle nature, she can read other people well, especially Takeru, and readily gives her opinion regarding the situation in question. After the final battle, Mako goes to Hawaii to live with her parents.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Pink|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30af|Shinken Pinku}}, she is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Air (classical element)|Sky]]\"|\u5929\u306e\u4f8d|Ten no Samurai}}, can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Pink|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30af|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Pinku}}, and can perform the {{nihongo|Pink Double Attack|\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30af|Pinku Daburu Atakku}} with Gosei Pink in ''Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku''.\n\nMako is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Rin Takanashi]]|\u9ad8\u68a8 \u81e8|Takanashi Rin}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/01.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, she is portrayed by {{nihongo|Marina Nakajima|\u4e2d\u5cf6 \u307e\u308a\u306a|Nakajima Marina}}.\n\n====Chiaki Tani====\n{{nihongo|'''Chiaki Tani'''|\u8c37 \u5343\u660e|Tani Chiaki}} is a lazy, irresponsible, selfish, and arrogant rebel. Initially, Chiaki had no interest in becoming Takeru's vassal and often clashed with him. The only reason he even worked with Takeru was because he thought it would be fun and he wanted to protect people. He is a great strategist despite his delinquency, and comes to respect Takeru as a rival when he realizes the limits of his own abilities, pledging to pass Takeru in skill someday. Chiaki was without his mother from an early age and was raised solely by his father, who planted in him the seed of his interest in martial arts. Despite not being formally trained, he is an excellent strategist and adept with surprise attacks, thanks to his imagination and free-spiritedness. When Genta arrives, Chiaki is the first to accept him into the team. Chiaki is very protective of Kotoha and seems to be uncomfortable when Genta's friend shows an interest in her. Even though he often butts heads with Ryunosuke, Chiaki respects him immensely for his skill; in fact, they work together so well that they become able to perform tasks in sync with one another. During time off from his duties, or when he is troubled, he often plays ''[[Tekken 6|Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion]]''. He prefers American surf wear and skate wear brands like [[Vans]] and especially Gotcha, whose vintage shirts he wears in most episodes. After the final battle, Chiaki plans to take his college entrance exams.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Green|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|Shinken Gur\u012bn}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Wood (classical element)|Wood]]\"|\u6728\u306e\u4f8d|Ki no Samurai}} and can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Green|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Gur\u012bn}} or the Kyoryu Disk to become {{nihongo|Hyper Shinken Green|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|Haip\u0101 Shinken Gur\u012bn}}.\n\nChiaki is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Shogo Suzuki (actor)|Shogo Suzuki]]|\u9234\u6728 \u52dd\u543e|Suzuki Sh\u014dgo}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/02.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>\n\n====Kotoha Hanaori====\n{{nihongo|'''Kotoha Hanaori'''|\u82b1\u7e54 \u3053\u3068\u306f|Hanaori Kotoha}} is a clumsy and gentle girl who worked in a bamboo shop and speaks with a {{nihongo|[[Kyoto]] accent|\u4eac\u90fd\u5f01|Ky\u014dtoben}}. Very much a crybaby as a child, she is close to her older sister, Mitsuba, who had been training to be Shinken Yellow. When Mitsuba became ill and unable to serve as Takeru's vassal, Kotoha stepped up to take her place. Kotoha is deeply respectful of Takeru and wants to help him in any way she can. She has rather low self-esteem; she genuinely believes that she is stupid (she claims that the only things that she is proficient at are her swordsmanship and her flute playing) and, despite her teammates' affection for her, often feels that she is a bother to them. She idolizes Mako and strives to become more like her. Kotoha often suggests that if Mitsuba never fell ill, the Shinkengers as a whole would probably be much stronger. However, her spirits are raised after she receives a letter from Mitsuba, in which Mitsuba says that Kotoha is the true Shinken Yellow. She never wears long pants and prefers to wear short shorts with knee socks. After the final battle, Kotoha returns home to Mitsuba.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Yellow|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|Shinken Ier\u014d}}, she is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]\"|\u571f\u306e\u4f8d|Tsuchi no Samurai}} and can borrow the Inromaru to become {{nihongo|Super Shinken Yellow|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Shinken Ier\u014d}}.\n\nKotoha is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Suzuka Morita]]|\u68ee\u7530 \u6dbc\u82b1|Morita Suzuka}}, who later portrayed Shelly in ''[[Space Sheriff Gavan: The Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/05.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, she is portrayed by {{nihongo|Ayu Matsuura|\u677e\u6d66 \u611b\u5f13|Matsuura Ayu}}.\n\n====Genta Umemori====\n{{nihongo|'''Genta Umemori'''|\u6885\u76db \u6e90\u592a|Umemori Genta}} is the son of a [[sushi]] chef who mysteriously disappeared prior to the beginning of the series, and a childhood friend of Takeru's. As a child, Genta often meddled in Takeru's training, which annoyed Hikoma greatly. Genta promised to help Takeru become a samurai, and in return, Takeru entrusted him with the Ika Disk. Years later, he is shown to have inherited the {{nihongo|Gold Zushi|\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u5bff\u53f8|G\u014drudo Zushi}} sushi cart and to have developed his own {{nihongo|\"Electronic Modikara\"|\u96fb\u5b50\u30e2\u30c2\u30ab\u30e9|Denshi Mojikara}}, using the Sushi Changer to [[Japanese input methods|type the kanji needed]]. The other Shinkengers are initially suspicious of Genta until he makes his formal introduction as Shinken Gold. Though Takeru is reluctant at first, he eventually allows Genta to fulfill his promise and join the team. Genta considers himself Takeru's best friend, despite their personalities being complete opposites; Genta is as hyperactive and expressive as much as Takeru is reserved and stoic. When Kaoru reveals herself, Genta immediately disapproves of her because of his relationship with Takeru, but later accepts her when he sees that she is very kind. After the final battle, Genta leaves to open a restaurant with DaiGoyou in [[Paris]] in hopes of fulfilling his lifelong dream of receiving a three-star rating by the ''[[Michelin Guide]]''.\n\nAs {{nihongo|Shinken Gold|\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Shinken G\u014drudo}}, he is the {{nihongo|\"Samurai of Light\"|\u5149\u306e\u4f8d|Hikari no Samurai}} and uses sushi-themed accouterments to transform and battle, like exploding [[chopsticks]] that he uses as a projectile weapon. He is considered a genius in using Modikara and is also one of the few who can use Modikara to create Origami, as well as being the only one in the group able to complete the Inromaru. After the Shinkengers defeat an Ayakashi in battle, Shinken Gold encourages everyone to do a victory clap before Shinken Red's ending catch phrase. In the special DVD ''The Light Samurai's Surprise Transformation'', Genta uses the Kyoryu Disk to transform from Shinken Gold into {{nihongo|Hyper Shinken Gold|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Haip\u0101 Shinken G\u014drudo}}.

She is referred to by her vassals and servants as {{nihongo|Princess|\u59eb|Hime}}. As the head of the Shiba House, Kaoru is the one who possesses the knowledge of the {{nihongo|Sealing Character|\u5c01\u5370\u306e\u6587\u5b57|F\u016bin no Moji}} also known as the {{nihongo|Gedou Seal|\u5916\u9053\u5c01\u5370|Ged\u014d F\u016bin}}, a Modikara passed along the Shiba bloodline (the kanji is fictional, but is composed of the kanji for {{nihongo3|\"Gate\"|\u9580|Mon}}, {{nihongo3|\"Sub-\"|\u4e9e|A}}, {{nihongo3|\"Sword\"|\u5263|Ken}}, and {{nihongo3|\"Flame\"|\u708e|Hon\u014d}}). Because of this, she stayed in hiding while Takeru acted as her ''kagemusha'' to draw the Gedoushu away from her. When she grows tired of living in hiding, she masters the Sealing Character to defeat the Gedoushu and assumes her birthright. Even though she is kind and easy to work with, she underestimates the vassals' dedication to Takeru, and when she is injured in attempting to use the Sealing Character, she adopts Takeru and gives up her birthright to allow Takeru to lead the Shinkengers in defeating Doukoku. She makes another appearance in ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku]]'', combining her Modikara with [[Goseigers#Alata|Alata]]'s Gosei Power to create the Kaentornado card, which is used to free Takeru from his Gedou Shinken Red form, and allow all the Shinkengers to utilize the Super Shinkenger form.\n\nLike Takeru, Kaoru is the \"Samurai of Fire\" and has the ability to become Shinken Red, referred to as {{nihongo|Princess Shinken Red|\u59eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Hime Shinken Reddo}} to differentiate with Takeru's Shinken Red, and use the Inromaru to transform into Super Shinken Red.

He also serves as the Shinkengers' mentor; it is he who gathered the four vassals when the Gedoushu revived. The Shinkengers affectionately call him {{nihongo|\"Jii\"|\u30b8\u30a4||translated as \"old man\" or \"samurai\"}}. Every year, he gets one day off, which he uses to visit his wife's grave and visit his daughter and granddaughter. His relationship with Takeru and his vassals runs deep; he takes great care to ensure that they are safe and that they are ready to fight, and he supplies them with information and weaponry. Though Genta frequently annoys him, Hikoma acknowledges the younger man's skill with Modikara and eventually does accept and connect with him. Like Mako, he is adept at reading people and often helps the vassals with their personal problems. When he goes to a hospital to be treated for a hip injury, he happens upon the [[List of Kamen Rider Decade characters#Hikari Studio|Hikari Studio]] and gives invaluable advice to Tsukasa Kadoya during the meeting of the worlds of ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' and ''Samurai Sentai Shinkenger''. While Hikoma does not typically take up arms himself, his \"battle\" is to ensure that Takeru and his vassals remain safe and will always have someplace to which they can return. When Kaoru makes her appearance, Hikoma remains loyal to Takeru, but bears no ill will towards Kaoru; he respects her for both her title and for the kind and diligent young woman that she is. After the final battle, he stays with Takeru even when he insists that he go visit his family and encourages Takeru to join him to experience other lifestyles other than just the samurai life.\n\nHikoma is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Goro Ibuki]]|\u4f0a\u5439 \u543e\u90ce|Ibuki Gor\u014d}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/06.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Kuroko===\nThe {{nihongo|[[kuroko]]|\u9ed2\u5b50}} are the Shiba House's servants who, like their namesakes, \"set up\" the scene during the Shinkengers' transformation.

They are skilled in many comparatively mundane things and are tasked with doing household chores, and help citizens in the nearby town to the best of their ability, when the Shinkengers are not in battle.

The Shodo Phone can also be used to summon other items with the proper kanji (and the proper stroke order, as Chiaki learns the hard way).

The Gedoshu maintain their wretched existence with the water of the Sanzu, and in order to maintain the river's levels, they constantly enter into the human world with the intent of running amok in order to feed the river with negative emotions of humans. If a Gedoshu spends too long in the human world, it eventually dries out, and petrifies if it can not return to the Sanzu.  Cursed to be in a state between life and death, a Gedoushu can only be free of its existence if it is slain upon taking its Second Life, or if it is able to let go of the [[up\u0101d\u0101na]] that damned it in the first place.\n\nThe Gedoushu under Doukoku reside on the {{nihongo|[[Six realms|Rokumon]] [[Junk (ship)|Junk]]|\u516d\u9580\u8239|Rokumonsen}} that sails along the Sanzu River. Others spend their time within the River itself until Doukoku or some other powerful being calls them. Using their ability to enter the living world through cracks and narrow gaps, Doukoku's minions set up a plan to terrorize humans in any way possible so that the river overflows to point of flooding into the mortal realm in order for them to invade in full fury. The Gedoushu can also become powerful during the time of [[Bon Festival]].\n\n===Doukoku===\n{{nihongo|Doukoku Chimatsuri|\u8840\u796d \u30c9\u30a6\u30b3\u30af|Chimatsuri D\u014dkoku|{{r|group=Note|Chimatsuri}}}} (1-40 & 47-49) is the leader of the Gedoushu and is armed with the {{nihongo|Sh\u014dry\u016b Bakuzant\u014d|\u6607\u7adc\u629c\u5c71\u5200||Rising Dragon Mountain-Removing Sword}}, the {{nihongo|K\u014dry\u016b Gaiseit\u014d|\u964d\u7adc\u84cb\u4e16\u5200||Descending Dragon World-Covering Sword}}, and possessing the power to seal his fellow Gedoushu. He is in a constant state of rage, originally endless until he heard the sound of Usuyuki's shamisen, becoming obsessed with her as he later takes her upon her rebirth into Dayu to soothe his rage along with [[sake]]. He targeted the Shiba House's previous Shinkengers, making it his goal to completely eliminate the Shiba House so no one would be able to stop him. However, while fighting the seventeenth head of the Shiba House, he was sealed away as the previous Shinken Red died. This seal was incomplete, and Doukoku was able to revive by the time of the next generation. To reach his goal again, Doukoku sends out Ayakashi to terrorize humans so the Sanzu River can overflow its banks into the mortal realm and enable him to unleash his full fury. This method of attack was later revealed to how he loses the rejuvenating qualities of its waters much faster than any other member of the Gedoushu and takes longer to soak the river's waters back into his body.\n\nLearning of the seal placed on him, Doukoku briefly changes his plans to target Takeru as the death of the Shiba House would ensure that he would never be sealed again. But when that plan failed, Doukoku has his force carry on the original plan without giving wind of this knowledge to any Ayakashi with his own agenda. During the summer while in a comatose state that leaves him open to his enemies, Doukoku manages to suppress his magnified power. Later, after learning of Akamaro's true colors, Doukoku risks his life to enter the mortal realm to repair Dayu's shamisen after driving off Akumaro and defeating Shinken Red. As a result, he has to be submerged in the Sanzu River to rehydrate. But after the Shiba Clan true's eighteenth head is revealed, Doukoku's followers attempt to speed up his awakening by increasing the amount of suffering until Dayu uses Shinza's anguish to bring Doukoku back to the mortal realm. After absorbing Dayu's energy to heal his body, Doukoku gains immunity to the Sealing Character and can now endure being in the mortal realm without drying up. As a result, Doukoku overpowers the Shinkengers before bringing the Rokumon Junk into the mortal realm when the Sanzu River floods the city. Thinking he had broken the Shinkengers' spirits when they attempt to defeat him, Doukoku is immobilized before Shinken Blue delivers the final blow. Assuming his second life, Doukoku overpowers Samuraihaoh, blasting it and throwing off its components until only Shinkenoh remains, then impales it on his sword. However, the Shinkengers take advantage of the events and mortally wound him before he explodes. He attempts to take the Shinkengers down with him, but this fails as they survive the explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/12.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Doukoku is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Vai\u015brava\u1e47a]]|[[:ja:\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929|\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929]]|Bishamonten}} and a [[Japanese spiny lobster]].<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nDoukoku is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Rintar\u014d Nishi]]|\u897f \u51db\u592a\u6717|Nishi Rintar\u014d}}, who previously portrayed Shadam in ''[[Gosei Sentai Dairanger]]''.\n\n===Tayu===\n{{nihongo|Tayu Usukawa|\u8584\u76ae \u592a\u592b|Usukawa Day\u016b|{{r|group=Note|Dayu}}}} (1-48) is Doukoku's right hand and the only one he is kind to, provided she knows her place as his obedient, unquestioning servant. Doukoku takes her in after her rebirth as a Gedoushu, giving her the name she now goes by and telling her that she has nowhere else to go but to him. But her unique origins set her apart from normal Gedoshu as she can move freely in the mortal realm. In life, she was {{nihongo|Usuyuki|\u8584\u96ea}} a [[shamisen]] player who obsessed over a man named Shinza. Scorned that he loved another woman instead of her, Usuyuki set fire to the building holding his wedding ceremony, killing him, his bride, and the entirety of their wedding party, in a suicidal [[crime of passion]]. Seeing that her love would remain unrequited to the bitter end, Usuyuki's emotions corrupt her soul and caused her rebirth into Tayu. The transformation also forcefully bonded Shinza's soul into the shamisen that Tayu carries with her, creating the eerie and unsettling songs that serve to soothe Doukoku's rage. The shamisen's [[headstock]] also doubles as the hilt of a [[shortsword]] Tayu uses in battle.\n\nOf all the Gedoushu, Tayu has the most trouble getting along with the Ayakashi because of her previous life as a human, which she makes attempts to reclaim. One failed attempt results with her being saved by Juzo, developing feelings for the Gedounin as she begins to defy Doukoku's orders with her shamisen damaged as a result. Though her feelings for Shinza had long died, Tayu refuses to give him up as it would end her existence and desires to know the purpose behind it. Leaving Doukoku, Tayu wanders aimlessly until she is found by Akumaro who recruits her to his group in return for her instrument's restoration. Until it is repaired, she has to rely on the {{nihongo|Sange Hankont\u014d|\u6563\u83ef\u6591\u75d5\u5200||Glorious Death Spotted-Scars Sword}} dagger in her fights. Upon learning that Akamaro never intended to repair her instrument, she attempts to reclaim her shamisen until Dokouku comes to her aid, using a piece of his body to restore the shamisen and reminding her of her place by his side. Soon after Akumaro's demise, Tayu returns to the Rokumon Junk to assist in Doukoku's reawakening. To that end, after finally having the answers to her questions, Tayu deliberately has Shinken Pink destroy her shamisen to not only discard her past life, but to also use Shinza's anguished soul to revive Doukoku. She later uses the last of her powers to restore Doukoku's body, giving him immunity to the Sealing Character and independence from the Sanzu River. With only her kimono remaining, Doukoku later throws it into the Sanzu River as a final respect to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/11.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Tayu is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Benzaiten]]|[[:ja:\u5f01\u624d\u5929|\u5f01\u8ca1\u5929]]}}, a [[Nudibranch|sea slug]], and various [[mollusca|molluscs]]<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/> and has elements of the {{nihongo|[[futakuchi-onna]]|[[:ja:\u4e8c\u53e3\u5973|\u4e8c\u53e3\u5973]]}}.\n\nBecause of the nature of [[rendaku]] in Japanese, her name is only Usukawa Dayu when it is said in full; otherwise, it is Tayu.

Shitari sees humans as mere specimens for his research, uncovering means to overflow the Sanzu River. He also possessed texts from the Shiba House which he used to learn about the seal placed on Doukoku. Though he warns Doukoku not to trouble himself with the Shiba House's sealing character so not to attract attention from certain Ayakashi, Shitari recruits Isagitsune in an attempt to slake his curiosity on what the sealing character is. He later recruits Oinogare in an attempt to re-open a well the Gedoushu used in the past as their base of operations by sacrificing nine maidens, formally introducing himself to the Shinkengers as a result.\n\nWhile Doukoku is in a vulnerable state struggling with his surging power, the rogue Ayakashi Gozunagumo bullies Shitari into extorting the sealing character from Shinken Red. Despite poisoning Takeru, Shitari fails to get him to reveal the sealing character due to the combined interference of Shinken Gold and Juzo. When Doukoku revives and punishes Gozunagumo, Shitari freely confesses that the one thing he values above Doukoku is his own life and gains forgiveness from his leader out of amusement with his honesty. During the events of ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' episodes 24 and 25, Shitari witnesses Daiki Kaitoh stealing the Ika Origami and sends the Ayakashi Chinomanako to investigate the otherworldly [[Kamen Rider Diend]], causing the chain of events that would doom their world. When Akumaro arrives, Shitari expresses a great deal of distrust over the mysterious Gedoushu and not as much shocked when his impression of him was accurate yet was powerless to do anything against him as he realized Akumaro's intentions. After Dayu returns, Shitari decides to kill off Takeru, only to learn the truth behind him and the Shiba House's true leader and giving up one half of his life, in an attempt to speed up Doukoku's reawakening at the cost of having no second life should he be killed. He remains on the Rokumon Junk during Doukoku's final battle with the Shinkengers, going down with the ship as it sinks in response to its master's death while proclaiming that he will survive regardless of what happens.\n\nShitari later returns in ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku]]'', becoming Buredoran's right hand servant until learning his plan to drain the Sanzu River and refusing to go along with it. But during the climatic battle, gathering an army of followers to kill Buredoran and reclaim the Sanzu River, Shitari ends up facing the [[Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger|Gokaigers]] when they traveled from the near future and they mistakenly believe him to be a hindrance in their own affairs{{r|group=Note|Gokaigers}}. With his army ultimately devastated, Shitari is destroyed by Gokai Red using the [[Go-ongers#S\u014dsuke Esumi|Go-On Red Ranger Key]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/13.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Shitari is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Fukurokuju]]|[[:ja:\u798f\u7984\u5bff|\u798f\u7984\u5bff]]}} and a [[squid]].<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nShitari is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Ch\u014d]]|\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc}}.\n\n===Juzo===\n{{nihongo|Juzo Fuwa|\u8151\u7834 \u5341\u81d3|Fuwa J\u016bz\u014d|{{r|group=Note|Juzo}}}} (7-47) is a mysterious Gedoushu, regarded by the others as a lone wolf, yet he seems to know more than Doukoku about the Sanzu River's true potential. 200 years ago, Fuwa was a samurai in life who made a living as an assassin, disenchanted with the ways of [[bushid\u014d]] and thriving more on the pleasure of killing his opponents in battle until he can no longer be physically able to wield a sword. He meets Akumaro who provides him with the katana {{nihongo|Uramasa|\u88cf\u6b63||\"[[Injustice]]\"}}, seemingly unaware that the blade was forged from the souls of his family who tried to free him from his blood lust. When he contracts a fatal illness, Fuwa enters the Sanzu River to cheat death, completely discarding the goodness in his heart to become a {{nihongo|Gedounin|\u5916\u9053\u4eba|Ged\u014dnin}}, a half-Gedoushu that can freely exist in both realms and assume a human form. However, unlike other Gedounin who die out in a few years, Fuwa endured over the centuries and thus is condemned with an insatiable urge to find an ideal opponent, a fellow samurai who strays from the teachings of bushid\u014d, to clash blades with. As a result, Fuwa mistakes the blade's cries of sadness for an equal lust for battle, believing that the souls of his family have lost their desire to stop him after he entered the Sanzu River.\n    \nHe finds this opponent in Takeru Shiba, after witnessing his sword fighting as Shinken Red. This obsession with fighting Shinken Red leads Doukoku to seal Fuwa's Gedoushu powers, leaving him for dead in the Sanzu River. Although he barely survives with Dayu's aid, he continues to defy Doukoku by making sure that Takeru is at his strongest for their next fight, even curing him of Shitari's poisoning. After a long battle in which he manages to severely wound Shinken Red, Fuwa is defeated and falls off the cliff into the ocean below. However, Fuwa survives with Uramasa's blade snapped in half. He remains in the mountainside until Dayu finds him and relays Akumaro's offer to work for him in return for restoring his blade. To his chagrin, he has to rely on the replacement {{nihongo|Bant\u014d Dokuh\u014dmatsu|\u86ee\u5200\u6bd2\u6ce1\u6cab||Barbarian Sword Poisonous Bubbles}} that hampers his normal fighting style. Later fed up waiting for the Uramasa to be repaired, Fuwa confronts Akumaro and learns his weapon's origins and that he is a pawn in Akumaro's plan. However, tricking Akumaro into giving him back his weapon and cutting him down, Fuwa reveals he knew the truth behind Uramasa from the first time he held it, thus preventing Akumaro from fulfilling his plan. Later, after the real Shiba House head is revealed, Fuwa gets Takeru to duel him once again before finally falling to him in battle with a delayed hit after Uramasa finally stops its master and denies him his only desire. Uramasa remains in the physical world after Fuwa fades away until the souls that formed it are finally able to depart into the afterlife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/16.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> Juzo is modeled after the {{nihongo|[[Sh\u014dj\u014d]]|[[:ja:\u7329\u7329|\u7329\u7329]]}} of Japanese myth (It replaced {{nihongo|[[Jur\u014djin]]|[[:ja:\u5bff\u8001\u4eba|\u5bff\u8001\u4eba]]}} and was sometimes depicted).<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nFuwa is portrayed and voiced by {{nihongo|[[Mitsuru Karahashi]]|\u5510\u6a4b \u5145|Karahashi Mitsuru}}, who previously portrayed Naoya Kaido/Snake [[Orphnoch]] in ''[[Kamen Rider 555]]'', Makage/Kagemaru in ''[[Lion Maru G]]'', and Grande in ''[[Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: Never Ending Odyssey]]''.\n\n===Akumaro===\n{{nihongo|Akumaro Sujigarano|\u7b4b\u6bbb \u30a2\u30af\u30de\u30ed|Sujigarano Akumaro|27-43,{{r|group=Note|Akumaro}}}} is a Gedoushu general with six slitted eyes and [[risus sardonicus|rictus grin]], whose ambition is to see [[Diyu|Hell]] and savor the immense suffering that it holds.

But when Doukoku's power burst revives him, he offers his services to Doukoku as gratitude. However, Doukoku strikes him near his left shoulder, ultimately creating a vulnerable spot. While pretending to aid Dokoku's group in raising the levels of the Sanzu River, taking any abuse from Doukoku to keep up his act, Akumaro starts setting up markers and recruits Juzo and Dayu into his service to make use of them. Eventually found out to be using Doukoku for his own agenda, Akumaro falls back after Doukoku nearly destroys him. However, with Doukoku resting, Akumaro takes the Rokumon Junk as his own while making the finishing touches on his master plan by completing the final marker to open up Hell and finishing Uramasa's repairs. Although he comes close to his goal, Akumaro is left with nothing when he realizes Juzo can not complete the Urami Gand\u014dgaeshi and goes into an enraged fury before the Shinkengers use the Rekka Daizantou and Super Mougyu Bazooka to slay him. After becoming a giant, Akumaro battles the Samurai Giants and DaiGoyou with his Kirigami before Samuraihaoh uses the Kyoryu Origami to form Super SamuraiHaOh and destroy him, with Akumaro laughing as his desire to see Hell is finally granted with his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/shinken/contents/chart/pop/18.html|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\uff5c\u4f8d\u6226\u968a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref> Akumaro is modeled after {{nihongo|[[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]|[[:ja:\u3048\u3073\u3059|\u3048\u3073\u3059]]}} and a [[shachihoko]] of Japanese myth.<ref name=\"Shinken Shobu!\"/>\n\nAkumaro is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Ry\u014d Horikawa]]|\u5800\u5ddd \u308a\u3087\u3046|Horikawa Ry\u014d}}.\n\n===Manpuku===\n{{nihongo|Manpuku Aburame|\u8102\u76ee \u30de\u30f3\u30d7\u30af|Aburame Manpuku|{{r|group=Note|Manpuku}}}} is the main antagonist in ''[[Samurai Sentai Shinkenger The Movie: The Fateful War]]'', the leader of the {{nihongo|Kusare Gedoushu|\u30af\u30b5\u30ec\u5916\u9053\u8846|Kusare Ged\u014dsh\u016b|{{r|group=Note|Kusare}}}} a group of powerful Gedoushu that exudes a corpse-like stench that was sealed away three centuries ago by Retsudou Shiba.
