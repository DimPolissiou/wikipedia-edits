In [[Christian theology]], [[pneumatology]] refers to the study of the Holy Spirit. Due to Christianity's historical relationship with Judaism, theologians often identify the Holy Spirit with the concept of the [[Holy Spirit in Judaism|''Ruach Hakodesh'']] in Jewish scripture, in the belief Jesus (who was Jewish) was expanding upon these Jewish concepts. Similar names, and ideas, include the ''Ruach [[Elohim]]'' (Spirit of God), ''Ruach YHWH'' (Spirit of [[Yahweh]]), and the ''Ruach Hakmah'' (Spirit of Wisdom).<ref name=\"Cathechism 711-712\">''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'': [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P22.HTM Expectation of the Messiah and his Spirit (nos. 711\u2013712)].</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Parsons|first1=John|title=Hebrew names for God|url=http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Names_of_G-d/Holy_Spirit/holy_spirit.html|quote=The Holy Spirit as revealed in the Brit Chadashah}}</ref> In the New Testament it is identified with the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, the [[Paraclete]] and the Holy Spirit.<ref name= Millsxi /><ref name=\"Paul pages 248-249\">Grabe, Petrus J.

The use of the word \"ruach\" (Hebrew: \"breath\", or \"wind\")  in the phrase ''ruach ha-kodesh'' seems to suggest that Judaic authorities believed the Holy Spirit was a kind of communication medium like the wind.

In particular:\n<blockquote>\nAnother Stoic concept which offered inspiration to the Church was that of 'divine Spirit'. [[Cleanthes]], wishing to give more explicit meaning to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno's]] 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated \u2013 in the Christian as in the Stoic mind \u2013 with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/25 25] |id={{ISBN|978-0-140-44140-6}} |isbn=0-14044140-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Symbolism and art==\n\n===Symbolism===\n[[File:Faroe stamp 537 jolavisan.jpg|thumb|130px|The Holy Spirit as a dove on a stamp from [[Faroe Islands]].]]\nThe Holy Spirit is frequently referred to by metaphor and [[Christian symbolism|symbol]], both doctrinally and biblically.

Although the expression \"Holy Spirit\" occurs in Ps. 51:11 and in Isa. 63:10\u201311, it had not yet acquired quite the same meaning which was attached to it in rabbinical literature: in the latter it is equivalent to the expression \"Spirit of the Lord\". In Gen.1:2 God's spirit hovered over the form of lifeless matter, thereby making the Creation possible.<ref name=je>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7833-holy-spirit \"Holy Spirit\", Jewish Encyclopedia]</ref> Although the ''ruach ha-kodesh'' may be named instead of God, it was conceived of as being something distinct; and, like everything earthly that comes from heaven, the ''ruach ha-kodesh'' is composed of light and fire.<ref name=je/> The most characteristic sign of the presence of the ''ruach ha-kodesh'' is the gift of prophecy. The use of the word \"ruach\" (Hebrew: \"breath\", or \"wind\")  in the phrase ''ruach ha-kodesh'' seems to suggest that Judaic authorities believed the Holy Spirit was a kind of communication medium like the wind. The spirit talks sometimes with a masculine and sometimes with a feminine voice; the word ''ruac\u1e25'' is both masculine and feminine.<ref name=je/>\n\n===New Testament===\nThe term Holy Spirit appears at least 90 times in the [[New Testament]].<ref name= Millsxi >''Acts and Pauline writings'' by Watson E.

The song samples the 1986 [[Detroit techno]] single \"Technicolor\" by [[Juan Atkins|Channel One]].\n\nAt the time of its original release, the song caused controversy with its outspoken and blatantly sexual lyrics about women, as well as specific references to the [[Cultural history of the buttocks|female buttocks]] which some people found objectionable.

Well I ain't down with that!\"\n\nThe song came from a meeting between Sir Mix-a-Lot and Amylia Dorsey who saw little representation of full figured women in media.

His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" Ultimately, the narrator says that the advice \"makes no sense at all\".\n\nThe song was inspired by a bit called \"No Loyal Men,\" performed by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his comedy special ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw|Raw]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y81Y655C2LU|title=How I Wrote That Song: Shaggy \"It Wasn't Me\"|date=April 23, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref> In an interview in February 2016, Shaggy acknowledged similarities with the [[War (U.S. band)|War]] song \"Smile Happy\".<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2016/02/shaggy-it-wasnt-me-15-year-anniversary-top-of-charts]</ref> The connection is further supported by [[Liam Payne]]'s debut single of 2017, \"[[Strip That Down]]\", itself based on \"It Wasn't Me\", which credited both Shaggy (as Orville Burrell) and members of War as co songwriters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://genius.com/a/liam-payne-interpolates-a-shaggy-classic-on-his-new-single-strip-that-down-featuring-quavo|title=Liam Payne Interpolates A Shaggy Classic On His New Single \"Strip That Down\" Featuring Quavo|last=Mench|first=Chris|date=May 19, 2017|work=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/liam-payne-insists-not-rip-11096834|title=Liam Payne insists he did not 'rip off' Shaggy song for new track as he gave singer credit|last=Rainbird|first=Ashleigh|date=September 1, 2017|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe clean version of the song replaces the lyric ''\"Picture this: we were both butt-naked banging on the bathroom floor\"'' with ''\"Picture this: we were both caught making love on the bathroom floor\"'' and ''\"Saw me banging on the sofa\"'' with ''\"Saw me kissing on the sofa\"''.\n\n\"It Wasn't Me\" was originally never intended to be released as a single. Before the original version of ''Hot Shot'' was released in August 2000, Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from \"a [[Napster]] like MP3 site he won't name\" and discovered that \"It Wasn't Me\" was \"the album's standout cut.\" He played the song on American radio the next day, and in an interview, claimed, \"The phone lines lit up right away.

The song is written in the key of C, in the [[Mixolydian mode]].\n\nThe song was spoofed by [[Bob Rivers]], as ''Caught Me One Handed'', and makes a reference to the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' character, [[Shaggy Rogers]]. The video focused on him being caught [[masturbating]] (about the girl next door) by his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyzKfk-kRgA|title=Caught Me One-Handed|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref> The song was also spoofed on ''[[Svengoolie]]''.

Rikrok tells him that he cheated on his girlfriend and got caught. Shaggy tells him to tell her that \"It wasn't me.\" The video then cuts into a flashback to earlier that day. Rikrok has been caught sleeping with another woman, and his girlfriend is outside the apartment in her convertible when two women pull up next to her on their motorcycles (sport bikes).\n\nThen, the three women go into the building. He then sneaks out the window, takes the motorcycle of one of his girlfriends accomplices and leaves. The women come out and the girlfriend and one of the accomplices get in the convertible and the other gets on her motorcycle and they chase after him. From his mansion, Shaggy, using his futuristic technology, tracks down where Rikrok is going and prepares an escape for him. Rikrok then gets on a bridge over the highway when the accomplice rode on the bridge in front of him.\n\nHe then hits the brakes to stop while she stops her motorcycle. Rikrok then hears a noise behind him and it's the other accomplices and the girlfriend driving the convertible on the other side of the bridge with the highway down below. An eighteen-wheeler drives by, and Shaggy leaves Rikrok a text message telling him to look behind and he notices the truck and jumps off the side of overhead and lands on the truck. He is then dropped off at Shaggy's mansion, showing the same scene from the start of the video.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe lyrics of \"It Wasn't Me\" inspired ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer [[Josh Levin]] to coin the term the \"[[Shaggy defense]]\" to describe [[R. Kelly]]'s defense at his child pornography trial stemming from the production of a sex tape: \"I predict that in the decades to come, law schools will teach this as the 'Shaggy defense'. You allege that I was caught on camera, butt naked, banging on the log cabin floor? It wasn't me.\"<ref>Josh Levin. May 21, 2008. \"[http://www.slate.com/id/2191876/entry/2191877/ Dispatches From the R. Kelly Trial]\".</ref>\n\nLevin repeated the term on [[NPR]].<ref>NPR. May 23, 2008. \"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90755482 Trapped in a Courtroom: The R. Kelly Trial]\".</ref> The term describes a strategy of flatly denying guilt and refusing to engage with the evidence against the defendant, no matter how overwhelming. R. Kelly was ultimately found not guilty on all charges.<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/1956/r-kelly-found-not-guilty/ R. Kelly Found Not Guilty!]</ref>\n\nThe song was referenced by [[Trevor Noah]] on an episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Trevor Noah]]'' in October 2016, when he covered the vice presidential debate between [[Mike Pence]] and [[Tim Kaine]], as Pence vehemently kept denying his running mate [[Donald Trump]]'s claims, despite the fact that the claims have been proved to be said by Trump on camera or through his Twitter account.<ref>Trevor Noah, October 4, 2016. [http://www.cc.com/video-clips/59yr4e/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-vice-presidential-debate-wrap-up Vice Presidential Debate Wrap-Up]</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the song was sampled by Puerto Rican singer [[Anuel AA]] in his song [[China (Anuel AA song)|\"China\"]]. The [[reggaet\u00f3n]] hit single uses an almost identical melody on the verse, and features the same theme of [[infidelity]].\n\n==Track listings==\n* '''UK'''\n\n'''CD Single'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:43\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Vocal 12\" Mix) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Dance & Shout\" (Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit) \u2013 8:07\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Enhanced Video) \u2013 3:43\n\n'''Cassette single'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:43\n# \"It Wasn't Me\"  \u2013 3:47\n\n*'''U.S.'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" \u2013 3:47\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Squeaky Remix) \u2013 4:25\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:47\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Sports Remix) \u2013 3:27\n\n* '''Australia'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:43\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Vocal 12\" Mix) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Dance & Shout\" (Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit) \u2013 8:07\n# \"Dance & Shout\" (Dancehall Version) \u2013 3:46\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Enhanced Video) \u2013 3:43\n\n==Charts and sales==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2000\u201301)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=Shaggy feat.

Me'''\" is the first single from [[Jamaican-American]] [[reggae]] artist [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]]'s multi Platinum studio album ''[[Hot Shot (Shaggy album)|Hot Shot]]'' (2000). The song features vocals from [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] and [[Rikrok]]. The [[lyrics]] of the song depict one man asking his friend what to do, after his girlfriend caught him [[Infidelity|having sex with another woman]]. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" \n\n\"It Wasn't Me\" has been regarded as Shaggy's breakthrough in the pop market, and is his highest charting song to date, topping the charts in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Poland]], the [[United States]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It was the best selling single of 2001 in the United Kingdom, selling over 1.15 million copies that year<ref name=\"UK year-end\"/> and over 1.42 million as of 2017.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[lyrics]] of \"It Wasn't Me\" depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another woman. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" Ultimately, the narrator says that the advice \"makes no sense at all\".\n\nThe song was inspired by a bit called \"No Loyal Men,\" performed by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his comedy special ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw|Raw]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y81Y655C2LU|title=How I Wrote That Song: Shaggy \"It Wasn't Me\"|date=April 23, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref> In an interview in February 2016, Shaggy acknowledged similarities with the [[War (U.S. band)|War]] song \"Smile Happy\".<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2016/02/shaggy-it-wasnt-me-15-year-anniversary-top-of-charts]</ref> The connection is further supported by [[Liam Payne]]'s debut single of 2017, \"[[Strip That Down]]\", itself based on \"It Wasn't Me\", which credited both Shaggy (as Orville Burrell) and members of War as co songwriters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://genius.com/a/liam-payne-interpolates-a-shaggy-classic-on-his-new-single-strip-that-down-featuring-quavo|title=Liam Payne Interpolates A Shaggy Classic On His New Single \"Strip That Down\" Featuring Quavo|last=Mench|first=Chris|date=May 19, 2017|work=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/liam-payne-insists-not-rip-11096834|title=Liam Payne insists he did not 'rip off' Shaggy song for new track as he gave singer credit|last=Rainbird|first=Ashleigh|date=September 1, 2017|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe clean version of the song replaces the lyric ''\"Picture this: we were both butt-naked banging on the bathroom floor\"'' with ''\"Picture this: we were both caught making love on the bathroom floor\"'' and ''\"Saw me banging on the sofa\"'' with ''\"Saw me kissing on the sofa\"''.\n\n\"It Wasn't Me\" was originally never intended to be released as a single. Before the original version of ''Hot Shot'' was released in August 2000, Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from \"a [[Napster]] like MP3 site he won't name\" and discovered that \"It Wasn't Me\" was \"the album's standout cut.\" He played the song on American radio the next day, and in an interview, claimed, \"The phone lines lit up right away. Within a couple of days, it was our number-one requested song.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/2001/Jan/18/118islandlife13.html |date=January 18, 2001 |publisher=Gannett Co., Inc. |work=The Honolulu Advertiser |title=Isle deejay takes credit for Shaggy hit |first=Derek |last=Paiva |accessdate=February 22, 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222232247/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/2001/Jan/18/118islandlife13.html |archivedate=February 22, 2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe song was then released as the album's first single in July 2000, following its radio success. The song is written in the key of C, in the [[Mixolydian mode]].\n\nThe song was spoofed by [[Bob Rivers]], as ''Caught Me One Handed'', and makes a reference to the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' character, [[Shaggy Rogers]]. The video focused on him being caught [[masturbating]] (about the girl next door) by his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyzKfk-kRgA|title=Caught Me One-Handed|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref> The song was also spoofed on ''[[Svengoolie]]''.

Rikrok tells him that he cheated on his girlfriend and got caught. Shaggy tells him to tell her that \"It wasn't me.\" The video then cuts into a flashback to earlier that day. Rikrok has been caught sleeping with another woman, and his girlfriend is outside the apartment in her convertible when two women pull up next to her on their motorcycles (sport bikes).\n\nThen, the three women go into the building. He then sneaks out the window, takes the motorcycle of one of his girlfriends accomplices and leaves. The women come out and the girlfriend and one of the accomplices get in the convertible and the other gets on her motorcycle and they chase after him. From his mansion, Shaggy, using his futuristic technology, tracks down where Rikrok is going and prepares an escape for him. Rikrok then gets on a bridge over the highway when the accomplice rode on the bridge in front of him.\n\nHe then hits the brakes to stop while she stops her motorcycle. Rikrok then hears a noise behind him and it's the other accomplices and the girlfriend driving the convertible on the other side of the bridge with the highway down below. An eighteen-wheeler drives by, and Shaggy leaves Rikrok a text message telling him to look behind and he notices the truck and jumps off the side of overhead and lands on the truck. He is then dropped off at Shaggy's mansion, showing the same scene from the start of the video.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe lyrics of \"It Wasn't Me\" inspired ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer [[Josh Levin]] to coin the term the \"[[Shaggy defense]]\" to describe [[R. Kelly]]'s defense at his child pornography trial stemming from the production of a sex tape: \"I predict that in the decades to come, law schools will teach this as the 'Shaggy defense'. You allege that I was caught on camera, butt naked, banging on the log cabin floor? It wasn't me.\"<ref>Josh Levin. May 21, 2008. \"[http://www.slate.com/id/2191876/entry/2191877/ Dispatches From the R. Kelly Trial]\".</ref>\n\nLevin repeated the term on [[NPR]].<ref>NPR. May 23, 2008. \"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90755482 Trapped in a Courtroom: The R. Kelly Trial]\".</ref> The term describes a strategy of flatly denying guilt and refusing to engage with the evidence against the defendant, no matter how overwhelming. R. Kelly was ultimately found not guilty on all charges.<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/1956/r-kelly-found-not-guilty/ R. Kelly Found Not Guilty!]</ref>\n\nThe song was referenced by [[Trevor Noah]] on an episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Trevor Noah]]'' in October 2016, when he covered the vice presidential debate between [[Mike Pence]] and [[Tim Kaine]], as Pence vehemently kept denying his running mate [[Donald Trump]]'s claims, despite the fact that the claims have been proved to be said by Trump on camera or through his Twitter account.<ref>Trevor Noah, October 4, 2016. [http://www.cc.com/video-clips/59yr4e/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-vice-presidential-debate-wrap-up Vice Presidential Debate Wrap-Up]</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the song was sampled by Puerto Rican singer [[Anuel AA]] in his song [[China (Anuel AA song)|\"China\"]]. The [[reggaet\u00f3n]] hit single uses an almost identical melody on the verse, and features the same theme of [[infidelity]].\n\n==Track listings==\n* '''UK'''\n\n'''CD Single'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:43\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Vocal 12\" Mix) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Dance & Shout\" (Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit) \u2013 8:07\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Enhanced Video) \u2013 3:43\n\n'''Cassette single'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:43\n# \"It Wasn't Me\"  \u2013 3:47\n\n*'''U.S.'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" \u2013 3:47\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Squeaky Remix) \u2013 4:25\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:47\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Sports Remix) \u2013 3:27\n\n* '''Australia'''\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:43\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Vocal 12\" Mix) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Dance & Shout\" (Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit) \u2013 8:07\n# \"Dance & Shout\" (Dancehall Version) \u2013 3:46\n# \"It Wasn't Me\" (Enhanced Video) \u2013 3:43\n\n==Charts and sales==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2000\u201301)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=Shaggy feat.

{"title_page": "Old Latium", "text_new": "{{Refimprove\n| date = April 2017\n}}[[File:Ligue-latine-carte.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Latium with the cities of the Latin League]]\n'''Old Latium''' ({{lang-la|Latium vetus}} or ''{{lang|la|Latium antiquum}}'') is a region of the [[Italian peninsula]] bounded to the north by the [[river Tiber]], to the east by the central [[Apennine mountains]], to the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the south by [[Monte Circeo]]. It was the territory of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], an [[Italic tribe]] which included the early inhabitants of the city of [[Rome]]. Later it was also settled by various Italic tribes such as the [[Rutulians]], [[Volscians]], [[Aequi]], and [[Hernici]].<ref>Strabon ''Geography'' III 10.</ref> The region was referred to as \"old\" to distinguish it from the expanded region, [[Latium]], that included the region to the south of Old Latium, between [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and the river [[Garigliano]] \u2013 the so-called [[Latium adiectum]] (\"attached Latium\"). It corresponded to the central part of the modern administrative region of [[Lazio]], [[Italy]], and it covered an area measuring of roughly 50 [[Roman miles]].<ref>Pliny ''NH'' III 56.</ref> It was calculated by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] that the region's area was about 1860 square kilometres.<ref>T. Mommsen ''History of Rome'' I 3, 3.</ref>\n\n==Settlement==\n====Literary tradition====\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] has preserved extensive information on the settlement of Latium in his book, ''<nowiki/>'Roman Antiquities''<nowiki/>', where he listed and discussed many legends and traditional stories related by historians and scholars, both Greek and Roman, on how Latium was settled. [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote about Old Latium. In his book '''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]''<nowiki/>', he lists two settlements in Old Latium that at the time of writing had disappeared. Other important literary sources include [[Livy]], [[Strabo]], [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], and [[Servius Danielis]].\n\nAccording to these sources Latium was first settled long ago by [[Sicels]] and [[Ligures]],<ref>Festus s. v.  ''sacrani'' p. 424 L: \"''Sacrani'' are named those who moved from Reate and expelled the Sicels and Ligures from the ''Septimontium''\"; Servius Danielis ''Ad Aeneidem'' XI 371, VIII ; Dionysius of  Halicarnassus ''RA'' I  12, 2 citing  Sophocles's ''Triptolemus'' on Oenotrians and Ligures settling the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea.</ref> but many sources contradict or do not state which of the two groups first settled Latium. According to the literary tradition, the Sicels and Ligures were forced out of Latium by the constant pressure exerted by the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]], who dwelt in [[Reate]], causing the Ligures to migrate to [[Liguria]] and the Sicels to [[Sicily]]. The migration of the tribes appears to have been from the hills and mountains of the region down towards the plains, although there are testimonies of Greek colonizers migrating by sea into the region, as in the legend of [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], and to southern Italy, as the Sicels were considered to be both [[Oenotrians]] of Greek origin,<ref>Dionysius of Hal. ''RA''  I 12, 3.</ref> and [[Rutulians|Rutulian]] of [[Dauni|Daunian]] origin.\n\nThe arrival of the [[Aeneads]] and the founding of [[Lavinium]] are claimed to mark the beginning of civilization in Latium<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0058</ref>, and 30 years after these events [[Alba Longa|Alba]] was founded, the city that led the [[Latin League]], a coalition of 30 cities and tribes that lasted for 500 years. While there are many different myths on the founding of these cities, it is known that the region and the Latin League were religiously influenced by the cult of Iuppiter Latiaris,  an [[Epithets of Jupiter|epithet of Jupiter]], and venerated this god as the high protector of the league.\n\n====Pliny's list====\nThe accounting provided by Pliny the Elder does not include all the centres of Latium Vetus that later developed into towns, but rather lists those which, according to the scholar, had disappeared by his time without leaving any trace. Therefore, he does not mention [[Anxur]], [[Tibur]], [[Cora (Ancient Latin town)|Cora]], [[Ficulea]], [[Nomentum]], [[Praeneste]], [[Gabii]], [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], [[Ariccia|Aricia]], [[Tusculum]], [[Lavinium]], [[Laurentum]], [[Lanuvium]], [[Labicum]], and [[Velitrae]], which were still standing, with the exception of old Labicum. But some settlements he mentions were in fact visited by Strabo only seventy years earlier (such as [[Tellenae]]), and some still certainly stood in his own time, such as [[Pedum]]. Another oddity of the passage is that while he claims there were fifty-three centres that had disappeared, his list numbers only fifty. Even though elsewhere he mentions two other sites, [[Apiolae]] and [[Amyclae (Italy)|Amyclae]], this still does not equal fifty-three. The list is in book III of his ''Natural History'' ch. 68 and 69:\n\n\"In the first region moreover in Latium were the famous walled towns (''clara oppida'') [[Satricum]], Scaptia, [[Politorium]], [[Tellena]], [[Tifata]], [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Ficana]], [[Crustumeria]], [[Ameriola]], [[Medullum]], [[Corniculum]], Saturnia now which is Rome, Antipolis (which is now the [[Janiculum]], a place in Rome), [[Antemnae]], [[Cameria|Camerium]], [[Collatia]], [[Amitinum]], [[Norba]], and [[Sulmo]]. Together with them the Alban Peoples who use to receive the (sacrificial) meat on the Alban Mount: Albani, Aesolani, Accienses, Abolani, Bubetani, Bolani, Cusuetani, Coriolani, Fidenates, Foreti, Hortenses, Latinienses, Longani, Manates, Macrales, Munienses, Numinienses, Olliculani, Octulani, Pedani, Poletaurini, Querquetulani, Sicani, Sisolenses, Tolerienses, Tutienses, Vimitellari, Velienses, Venetulani, Vitellienses.\"\n\nThe list is apparently made up of two sections, the first is referred to as ''clara oppida'' and the second as ''populi Albenses''. The last two towns mentioned among the ''clara oppida'', Norba and Sulmo, were in fact within Latium Adiectum. They were destroyed in the 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC during the war between Marius and Sulla.\n\nThe second section gives the names of the ''populi Albenses''. These were local communities inhabiting the region of ''Mons Albanus'' (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some of them seem to have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic [[Bronze Age]] organization of  human settlement: sparse, polycentric and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Latiaris''. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium,<ref>Cf. Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'': a crack sound was heard in the  Ager Latiniensis.</ref> and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.\n\n====Dionysius's list====\nDionysius gives a list of the towns members  of the Latin League that voted for war against Rome after the capture of Fidenae by the Romans, under the influence of Aricia and of former king Tarquinius the Proud at an assembly held at Ferentinum:<ref>Dionysius V 61 3. D. calls ''Ferentinum'' the ''caput Ferentinae'' or ''aquae Ferentinae'' of Roman authors. See below A. Grandazzi's citations in the discussion of the issue.</ref>\n\n\"Ardea, Aricia, Bovillae, Bubentum, Cora, Carventum, Circei, Corioli, Corbio, Cabum, Fortinea,  Gabii, Laurentum, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Labici, Nomentum, Norba, Praeneste, Pedum, Querquetula, Satricum, Scaptia, Setia, Tibur, Tusculum, Tolerium, Tellenae, Velitrae.\"\n\nAs Niebuhr remarked, once again the total yields the sacred number of thirty, but the sum is made up of different components. It is a mix of some of the members of the ''populi Albenses'' and some of the ''clara oppida''. In fact, many of the ''oppida'' had been destroyed or resettled by the Romans during the regal period, namely Caenina, Politorium, Ficana, Cameria, Medullium, Corniculum, Collatia. Among the ''clara oppida'' of Pliny's list, Satricum, Norba, Sulmo, Scaptia, Tellenae show up here, and among the ''populi albenses'' Bubentum, Corioli, Pedum, Querquetula, Tolerium, and possibly Nomentum.\n\n====Other sources====\nIn his description of Augustan region I, which included Old Latium, the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions many old towns, among them [[Collatia]], [[Antemnae]], [[Fidenae]] and [[Labicum]], as reduced to mere villages, private rural estates or displaced to different locations; [[Apiolae]], [[Suessa]] and [[Alba Longa]] as disappeared; [[Tellenae]] on the foothills southwest of the Alban Hills as still standing.\n\nThe historiographer Livy and the lexicographer [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also repeatedly mention the old Latin towns.  Another tradition related by [[Philistos of Syracuse]] calls the Sicels Ligurians, whose king was a Sikelos. This tradition is followed by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], who cites [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] as his authority.\n\nThese ancient traditions have led some scholars to look for traces of the presence of these peoples in later populations.\n\n==Archaeological evidence==\n[[File:Dalla-collezione-di-villa-poniatowski 31961476356 o.jpg|thumb|Polychrome antefix with female head with nimbus from [[Lanuvium]], late-Archic temple of Juno Sospita, 500 B.C., Villa Poniatowski, [[Rome]]]]\n[[File:Statua acroteriale di arpia-sirena, inizi del V sec ac., da gabii (mus. villa giulia).JPG|thumb|Acroterial statue of harpy-siren, beginning of the V century B.C. from [[Gabii]]]]\n[[File:Sima frontonale con processione di carri e cavalli alati, 510-490 ac ca., da palestrina (M. villa giulia) 02.JPG|thumb|Frontonal sima with procession of floats and winged horses, 510-490 B.C., from [[Praeneste]]]]\n[[File:Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from Satricum (Latium vetus) 490-470 BC.jpg|thumb|right|Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from the acropolis, Temple of Mater Matuta, 490-470 BC, from [[Satricum]]]]\nEven though erudite scholars have been trying to ascertain the location of the ancient towns of Latium for at least the last four centuries (see Cluvier), and despite the recent progress made by archaeology in the field of the human settlement of ancient Latium, only a few towns of archaic Latium cited by ancient sources have been identified with certainty, whereas a remarkable number of settlements that have been unearthed remain unidentified. This is due to the lack of epigraphic confirmation, due to the rare use of writing in archaic times. The problem is made even more difficult because some of the ancient locations were possibly resettled during the [[Early Middle Ages]], as was probably the case for Labicum and Collatia. A good instance of such a custom is provided by Falerii outside Latium Vetus.  Towns which have been identified archaeologically include Satricum, Politorium, Ficana, Tellenae, Crustumerium, Corniculum, Antemnae, Collatia, Fidenae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Apiolae, Gabii and perhaps Querquetulum. [[Alba Longa]], Pometia and Corioli remain unidentified. Traces of the presence of the Ligures and Sicels remain in the [[toponymy]] and [[onomastics]].<ref>See the works by  G. Sergi, F. Ribezzo, G. Devoto, G. Alessio and A. Grandazzi cited below.</ref>\n\nThe most conspicuous case and one which has given rise to long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by [[Ascanius]] and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.<ref>A. Grandazzi \"La localisation d' Alba\" in  MEFRA 1986. See section below.</ref>\n\n===Amitinum===\nThis centre was located to the east of Rome on the Corniculan Mountains, not far from Curniculum. Its identification is due to an inscription that mentions a ''pagus amentinus''.<ref>CIL VI 251.</ref>\n\n===Antemnae===\nThe town of Antemnae was located three miles to the north of Rome on the left bank of the river Anio and close to its confluence with the Tiber. Its name means \"between the rivers\" (Antemnae is the Sabine for Latin ''interamnes''). Some of its ruins were discovered in 1880 during excavations to build the fortress \"Forte Antenne\". Later excavations yielded additional material. The location is now within the urban area of Rome.\n\nAntemnae was colonised by Rome at the time of Romolus during the first effort to control the left bank of the Tiber up to the Anio, thus ensuring a communication  route with Etruria along the Via Salaria. The Antemnates and the Caeninenses were granted full Roman citizenship. Nevertheless, the town revolted several times, the last time in 507 BC.<ref>Dionysius Hal. V 21.</ref>\n\n===Apiolae===\nDestroyed by [[Tarquinius Priscus]], the remains have been identified and excavated. The town was located on Monte Savello between [[Albano Laziale|Albano]] and [[Pavona]]. It housed a temple of Apollo and the famous spring of [[Juturna]], with nearby Lake Turni being the object of a local cult. Today the two water sources are known as the spring of Secciano and the Laghetto di Pavona.\n\n===Aefulae===\nThe site of the settlement of the Alban people Aesulani has been identified with the hilltop castrum of Aefulae near ancient Tibur and close to the site of one of the temples of [[Bona Dea]]. It was deserted by the original dwellers and later resettled by the Romans, who turned it into a military fort.<ref>Aesulae is the Latin pronunciatiation of a Sabine Aefulae i.e. meaning Aedules.</ref>\n\n===Bolae===\nThe site of the Alban people Bolani is frequently mentioned by the historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. It was occupied by the Aequians probably already in the late 6th century or in the wars led by [[Coriolanus]].<ref>Dion. Hal. VIII 18.</ref> Its site is not known with certainty, but it must have stood not far from Praeneste and Labicum.\n\n===Corioli===\nThe site of this settlement must have stood on the south-west side of the Alban Hills near Genzano and Lanuvium.\n\n===Pedum===\nThe most important of the Latin towns developed from the ancient ''populi albenses'', [[Pedum]] stood between Tibur and Praeneste near modern [[Gallicano nel Lazio]]. It was taken by the Romans with Coriolanus.<ref>Livy II 39; Plutarch ''Cor.'' 28.</ref> After the final demise of the Latin League, the town declined.\n\n===Tolerium===\nThis settlement of the Alban people was probably not far from Pedum, according to a passage in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (7.26).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438853 |title=Places: 438853 (Tolerium) |author=Purcell, N., R.

It may have been located near present-day \"La Rustica\" close to the [[Aniene|Anio river]], on a trade route connecting Latium with Etruria and Campania.<ref>P. Zaccagni in ''Civilt\u00e1 del Lazio primitivo. Catalogo della Mostra'' Roma 1976 p. 155.</ref> Festus states it was close to the old Roman settlement.

Wissowa  RE  1279.</ref> by Romulus, who celebrated his first triumph after conquering the Caeninenses and killing their king, [[Acron]]. However, according to Dionysius, Romulus allowed the Caeninenses to continue to live in their hometown, although they had to accept a colony of three hundred Romans and the allotment to them of one third of their land.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 35, 3-5.</ref> The town is still mentioned at the beginning of the Republic: the Vindicius who revealed the plot of the Aquilii to [[Publius Valerius Publicola]]  was a slave from Caenina captured in war.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' V 7, 3.</ref>\n\nThe town name may be related to Latin ''caenum'' (mud, lime), itself a word with no Indoeuropean etymology.<ref>G. Alessio \"Problemi storico-linguistici messapici\" in ''Studi salentini'' 1962 '''14''' p. 318 n. 131.</ref> Another possibility is that it was of Celtic (Ligurian) origin.\n\n===Cameria or Camerium===\nSince Romulus made this town into a Roman colony, it fought many wars against Rome. In 502 BC it was destroyed, and its ruins have not yet been found; it was located to the north-east of Rome.\n\n===Collatia===\nStrabo places [[Collatia]] some 30 [[stadia (length)|stades]] from Rome. Though by his time it had been reduced to farmland. The location of the site has not yet been identified with certainty, but it was located near modern [[Lunghezza]], to the east of Rome. Likely it stood on the hill now occupied by the [[Castello di Lunghezza]]; which lies at the terminus of the ancient [[Via Collatina]]. The town was conquered and colonized by the Romans. Livy preserves the formula of their surrender, often cited as example of the [[deditio in fide]].\n\nCollatia was founded by the Latin king [[Alba Silvius|Silvius]] of Alba Longa and it was the hometown of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], one of the first two consuls of the Roman Republic.\n\n===Curniculum or Corniculum===\nThe town has been located by modern scholars in the present position of [[Montecelio]] (formerly Monticelli) in the comune of [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]], not far from [[Tibur]]. The two adjacent hills shaped like a pair of horns were the source of its name, and the nearby mountain range is still known as \"Monti Cornicolani\". \n\nNear Montecelio, relics dating from the [[Iron Age]] and fragments of pottery from the 7th-6th centuries BC have been discovered. The town was destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus<ref>Livy I 38; 39. Dionysius III 50; IV 1. Ovid  Fasti VI 627 ff.</ref> and was believed to be the hometown of [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother, Ocresia.\n\n===Crustumerium or Crustumeria===\nThe site of [[Crustumerium]] has been known since the 19th century. It is located in the hills of the Riserva Naturale park of Marcigliana Vecchia, to the north of Rome near Settebagni, on the [[Via Salaria]]. The town was also known as ''Castrimoenium'' and ''Crustumeria'' and has given its name to the surrounding countryside and hills known as \"Ager Crustuminus\" and \"Montes Crustumini\". According to Servius it was originally a settlement of the [[Sicels]],  founded by the Sicel Clitemnestrus.<ref>Servius Danielis \"ad Aeneidem\" VII 631 = Cassius Hemina fragm. 2 Peter.</ref> The etymology of the name is unclear and may reflect an ancient Pre-Indo European toponymic ''crustulum'', meaning pond.<ref>Ambra Costanzo Garancini, ''La romanizzazione nel bacino idrografico padano attraverso l\u2019odierna idronimia'', Firenze, La Nuova Italia, 1975 (Pubblicazioni della Facolt\u00e0 di Lettere e Filosofia dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, 75), p. 124.</ref>\n\nCrustumerium has been and is still being excavated by archaeologists and its study has been important for understanding urban development in Old Latium. It was located on one of the routes that linked [[Veii]] and [[Gabii]], close to a ford on the Tiber, which fact, along with the richness of its countryside, was the cause of its importance and wealth.<ref name=\"QuiliciGigli1980\">{{cite book|author1=Lorenzo Quilici|author2=Stefania Quilici Gigli|title=Crustumerium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JREvAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche, Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica}}</ref>\n\nThe town stretched along a road trench and occupied an area of 60 hectares. It had walls that were a complex made by four or five parallel stretches connected by normal ones and covered with stone slabs. Tombs contained a rich production of fine pottery painted in white and red, weapons, and other instruments from the early Iron Age onward. \n\nThe town is mentioned in the Aeneid, and in the history of Rome it was involved in the abduction of the Sabine women and the subsequent war. Further, Romulus is said to have installed a colony of Romans there. Later it is frequently mentioned in the wars between Rome and its neighbors. \n\nLiterary sources put the destruction of Crustumerium at the end of the sixth century,<ref>Livy II 19.</ref> but archaeologists have shown it was still occupied in the fifth century and declined only in the fourth century.<ref>A. Amoroso \"Crustumerium: a frontier settlement\" in ''Bollettino di Archeologia'' 2001.</ref>\n\n===Ficana===\n[[Ficana]] was located  on the left bank of the Tiber, downstream from Rome, near present-day [[Acilia]] on the highland over Monte Cugno. In ancient times, this provided an advantage as it was steeper and a dominant position on the river. Its identification is confirmed by the find of an inscription. The sources state that it was destroyed twice by Ancus Marcius in his drive to control the lower course of the Tiber and the salines, together with Politorium and Tellenae. Its importance was owed to the fact it was a port that afforded a commercial route to the hinterland toward the Alban Hills and Aricia.\n\nArchaeologists have shown that it was still a prosperous centre during the 4th century and reached its maximum expansion after the Roman conquest. It declined only in the 4th and 3rd centuries after the development of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]. Excavations have unearthed the town wall, housing areas and a necropolis. Long-necked [[amphora]]s  decorated with reliefs or scratches of a style typical of 7th-century Old Latium testify to the early quality of the local material culture. The Ficana site is now an archaeological park.{{When|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Medullium===\nAlso known in the sources as [[Medullia]], its exact location is unknown. It was the hometown of [[Hostus Hostilius]]'s family and was conquered by Tullus Hostilius, although not destroyed. Its name suggests a relationship to the Ligurian tribe of the Medulli (Medylloi in Strabon IV 1, 11) and would appear to be cognate with the Celtic deity Meduna.<ref>G. Alessio \"Genti e favelle dell'antica Apulia\" Cressati Taranto 1949 p. 17 n. 3 (= ''Archivio Storico Pugliese''  II 1949) citing Holder ''Altceltische Sprache'' II col. 528: cfr. German ''Met''.</ref> Strabo<ref>IV 6.</ref> mentions two other towns named Medullia, one on the western alps in Gallia and one on the eastern alps in Iapudia.\n\n===Politorium===\n[[Politorium]] has been identified in the archaic settlement found near [[Castel di Decima]], south-east of Rome, but this identification lacks epigraphic confirmation. It is mentioned by Cato, who records its founding, and by Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassos, who describe its capture and successive demolition by Ancus Marcius. Its inhabitants would have been deported to the Aventine. These facts are part of the first expansive drive by Rome toward the sea, which also brought about the fall of Ficana and Tellenae.\n\nThe excavations have uncovered remains of the fortifications and a princely necropolis.\n\n===Satricum===\n[[Satricum]] was recorded by Pliny as the first in his list of ''clara oppida''. It was an important and ancient settlement of the Latin and other tribes and arose near the prehistoric sanctuary of [[Mater Matuta]]. It has been identified by archaeologists at Le Ferriere, in the present [[Province of Latina]], and it was systematically excavated by the Royal Dutch Institute in Rome in collaboration with Italian authorities. During excavations in 1977 the inscription known as [[Lapis Satricanus]] was unearthed.<ref name=\"Stibbe1980\">{{cite book|author=C. M.

Its location has not been identified, with some scholars suggesting that it was located near Tibur or near Passerano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438829 |title=Places: 438829 (Scaptia) |author=Purcell, N., R.

Helbig ''Die Italiker in der Poebene'' 1879.</ref> [[Giuseppe Sergi]]<ref>G. Sergi ''Da Albalonga a Roma. Inizio dell'incivilimento in Italia, ovvero Liguri e Siculi'' Turin 1934 p. 3ff.</ref> remarked that the early name of the Tiber was Albula, a name that recurs elsewhere in [[hydronymy]] where there are traces of Ligurians and Sicels.<ref>The Albula, a source near Tibur. The Albula oracle in Virgil's Aeneis. An Albula river in Picenum near Numana, town that Pliny NH III 13 ascribes to the Sicels; another one in the Lepontine Alps; one in the Grisons canton of present day Switzerland. The Albinia river in Etruria (now [[Albegna]]), a river Alba in Sicily and another one in Northeast Spain.</ref> Further evidence connecting Ligures and Siculi was provided by a neolithic skeleton unearthed at Sgurgola near [[Anagni]] that was painted red, as were the ones found in the Ligurian cave of the \"[[Arene Candide]]\". Sergi concluded that Ligures and Siceli were in fact just one [[ethnic group]], but since they lived far apart, they had come to be considered as two distinct nations. Their identity could be confirmed by ancient [[toponymy|toponyms]] found in Latium as well as other regions of Italy. Strabon also mentions that a former name for the Alps was Albia.\n\nOther correspondences include the ancient name of the [[Lake of Bracciano]], ''Sabatinus Lacus'' and the town of Sabate on its shores, and the river S\u0101pis in Umbria, names based on a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] root *s\u0101b- meaning water, seen also in the name [[Vada Sabatia]] (today [[Vado Ligure]]).<ref>C.

In the lowlands, cereals and legumes were grown. In the hills, grapes were planted, and wines such as Setinus, Albanus, and Signinus, were of good quality.<ref>Strabo V 3, 2; V 3, 10.</ref> In the highlands, animal husbandry took the place of food production as an economic force.     \n\n[[Gabii]] had famous quarries of red [[travertine]] stone, which was used as building material in the surrounding area, Rome included.<ref>Strabo V 3, 10-11.</ref> Crafts, such as smithing and pottery, were also developed. \n\nDiseases like [[malaria]] were restricted to coastal areas and a few other locations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Latium]] \u2014 ''all periods''.\n* [[New Latium]]\n* {{C|History of Lazio}}\n* {{C|History of Rome}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Latium vetus}}\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n{{Ancient Rome topics|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:History of Rome|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:History of Lazio|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of Italy|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Metropolitan City of Rome Capital|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Latial culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove\n| date = April 2017\n}}[[File:Ligue-latine-carte.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Latium with the cities of the Latin League]]\n'''Old Latium''' ({{lang-la|Latium vetus}} or ''{{lang|la|Latium antiquum}}'') is a region of the [[Italian peninsula]] bounded to the north by the [[river Tiber]], to the east by the central [[Apennine mountains]], to the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the south by [[Monte Circeo]]. It was the territory of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], an [[Italic tribe]] which included the early inhabitants of the city of [[Rome]]. Later it was also settled by various Italic tribes such as the [[Rutulians]], [[Volscians]], [[Aequi]], and [[Hernici]].<ref>Strabon ''Geography'' III 10.</ref> The region was referred to as \"old\" to distinguish it from the expanded region, [[Latium]], that included the region to the south of Old Latium, between [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and the river [[Garigliano]] \u2013 the so-called [[Latium adiectum]] (\"attached Latium\"). It corresponded to the central part of the modern administrative region of [[Lazio]], [[Italy]], and it covered an area measuring of roughly 50 [[Roman miles]].<ref>Pliny ''NH'' III 56.</ref> It was calculated by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] that the region's area was about 1860 square kilometres.<ref>T. Mommsen ''History of Rome'' I 3, 3.</ref>\n\n==Settlement==\n====Literary tradition====\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] has preserved extensive information on the settlement of Latium in his book, ''<nowiki/>'Roman Antiquities''<nowiki/>', where he listed and discussed many legends and traditional stories related by historians and scholars, both Greek and Roman, on how Latium was settled. [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote about Old Latium. In his book '''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]''<nowiki/>', he lists two settlements in Old Latium that at the time of writing had disappeared. Other important literary sources include [[Livy]], [[Strabo]], [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], and [[Servius Danielis]].\n\nAccording to these sources Latium was first settled long ago by [[Sicels]] and [[Ligures]],<ref>Festus s. v.  ''sacrani'' p. 424 L: \"''Sacrani'' are named those who moved from Reate and expelled the Sicels and Ligures from the ''Septimontium''\"; Servius Danielis ''Ad Aeneidem'' XI 371, VIII ; Dionysius of  Halicarnassus ''RA'' I  12, 2 citing  Sophocles's ''Triptolemus'' on Oenotrians and Ligures settling the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea.</ref> but many sources contradict or do not state which of the two groups first settled Latium. According to the literary tradition, the Sicels and Ligures were forced out of Latium by the constant pressure exerted by the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]], who dwelt in [[Reate]], causing the Ligures to migrate to [[Liguria]] and the Sicels to [[Sicily]]. The migration of the tribes appears to have been from the hills and mountains of the region down towards the plains, although there are testimonies of Greek colonizers migrating by sea into the region, as in the legend of [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], and to southern Italy, as the Sicels were considered to be both [[Oenotrians]] of Greek origin,<ref>Dionysius of Hal. ''RA''  I 12, 3.</ref> and [[Rutulians|Rutulian]] of [[Dauni|Daunian]] origin.\n\nThe arrival of the [[Aeneads]] and the founding of [[Lavinium]] are claimed to mark the beginning of civilization in Latium<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0058</ref>, and 30 years after these events [[Alba Longa|Alba]] was founded, the city that led the [[Latin League]], a coalition of 30 cities and tribes that lasted for 500 years. While there are many different myths on the founding of these cities, it is known that the region and the Latin League were religiously influenced by the cult of Iuppiter Latiaris,  an [[Epithets of Jupiter|epithet of Jupiter]], and venerated this god as the high protector of the league.\n\n====Pliny's list====\nThe accounting provided by Pliny the Elder does not include all the centres of Latium Vetus that later developed into towns, but rather lists those which, according to the scholar, had disappeared by his time without leaving any trace. Therefore, he does not mention [[Anxur]], [[Tibur]], [[Cora (Ancient Latin town)|Cora]], [[Ficulea]], [[Nomentum]], [[Praeneste]], [[Gabii]], [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], [[Ariccia|Aricia]], [[Tusculum]], [[Lavinium]], [[Laurentum]], [[Lanuvium]], [[Labicum]], and [[Velitrae]], which were still standing, with the exception of old Labicum. But some settlements he mentions were in fact visited by Strabo only seventy years earlier (such as [[Tellenae]]), and some still certainly stood in his own time, such as [[Pedum]]. Another oddity of the passage is that while he claims there were fifty-three centres that had disappeared, his list numbers only fifty. Even though elsewhere he mentions two other sites, [[Apiolae]] and [[Amyclae (Italy)|Amyclae]], this still does not equal fifty-three. The list is in book III of his ''Natural History'' ch. 68 and 69:\n\n\"In the first region moreover in Latium were the famous walled towns (''clara oppida'') [[Satricum]], Scaptia, [[Politorium]], [[Tellena]], [[Tifata]], [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Ficana]], [[Crustumeria]], [[Ameriola]], [[Medullum]], [[Corniculum]], Saturnia now which is Rome, Antipolis (which is now the [[Janiculum]], a place in Rome), [[Antemnae]], [[Cameria|Camerium]], [[Collatia]], [[Amitinum]], [[Norba]], and [[Sulmo]]. Together with them the Alban Peoples who use to receive the (sacrificial) meat on the Alban Mount: Albani, Aesolani, Accienses, Abolani, Bubetani, Bolani, Cusuetani, Coriolani, Fidenates, Foreti, Hortenses, Latinienses, Longani, Manates, Macrales, Munienses, Numinienses, Olliculani, Octulani, Pedani, Poletaurini, Querquetulani, Sicani, Sisolenses, Tolerienses, Tutienses, Vimitellari, Velienses, Venetulani, Vitellienses.\"\n\nThe list is apparently made up of two sections, the first is referred to as ''clara oppida'' and the second as ''populi Albenses''. The last two towns mentioned among the ''clara oppida'', Norba and Sulmo, were in fact within Latium Adiectum. They were destroyed in the 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC during the war between Marius and Sulla.\n\nThe second section gives the names of the ''populi Albenses''. These were local communities inhabiting the region of ''Mons Albanus'' (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some of them seem to have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic [[Bronze Age]] organization of  human settlement: sparse, polycentric and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Latiaris''. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium,<ref>Cf. Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'': a crack sound was heard in the  Ager Latiniensis.</ref> and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.\n\n====Dionysius's list====\nDionysius gives a list of the towns members  of the Latin League that voted for war against Rome after the capture of Fidenae by the Romans, under the influence of Aricia and of former king Tarquinius the Proud at an assembly held at Ferentinum:<ref>Dionysius V 61 3. D. calls ''Ferentinum'' the ''caput Ferentinae'' or ''aquae Ferentinae'' of Roman authors. See below A. Grandazzi's citations in the discussion of the issue.</ref>\n\n\"Ardea, Aricia, Bovillae, Bubentum, Cora, Carventum, Circei, Corioli, Corbio, Cabum, Fortinea,  Gabii, Laurentum, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Labici, Nomentum, Norba, Praeneste, Pedum, Querquetula, Satricum, Scaptia, Setia, Tibur, Tusculum, Tolerium, Tellenae, Velitrae.\"\n\nAs Niebuhr remarked, once again the total yields the sacred number of thirty, but the sum is made up of different components. It is a mix of some of the members of the ''populi Albenses'' and some of the ''clara oppida''. In fact, many of the ''oppida'' had been destroyed or resettled by the Romans during the regal period, namely Caenina, Politorium, Ficana, Cameria, Medullium, Corniculum, Collatia. Among the ''clara oppida'' of Pliny's list, Satricum, Norba, Sulmo, Scaptia, Tellenae show up here, and among the ''populi albenses'' Bubentum, Corioli, Pedum, Querquetula, Tolerium, and possibly Nomentum.\n\n====Other sources====\nIn his description of Augustan region I, which included Old Latium, the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions many old towns, among them [[Collatia]], [[Antemnae]], [[Fidenae]] and [[Labicum]], as reduced to mere villages, private rural estates or displaced to different locations; [[Apiolae]], [[Suessa]] and [[Alba Longa]] as disappeared; [[Tellenae]] on the foothills southwest of the Alban Hills as still standing.\n\nThe historiographer Livy and the lexicographer [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also repeatedly mention the old Latin towns.  Another tradition related by [[Philistos of Syracuse]] calls the Sicels Ligurians, whose king was a Sikelos. This tradition is followed by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], who cites [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] as his authority.\n\nThese ancient traditions have led some scholars to look for traces of the presence of these peoples in later populations.\n\n==Archaeological evidence==\n[[File:Dalla-collezione-di-villa-poniatowski 31961476356 o.jpg|thumb|Polychrome antefix with female head with nimbus from [[Lanuvium]], late-Archic temple of Juno Sospita, 500 B.C., Villa Poniatowski, [[Rome]]]]\n[[File:Statua acroteriale di arpia-sirena, inizi del V sec ac., da gabii (mus. villa giulia).JPG|thumb|Acroterial statue of harpy-siren, beginning of the V century B.C. from [[Gabii]]]]\n[[File:Sima frontonale con processione di carri e cavalli alati, 510-490 ac ca., da palestrina (M. villa giulia) 02.JPG|thumb|Frontonal sima with procession of floats and winged horses, 510-490 B.C., from [[Praeneste]]]]\n[[File:Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from Satricum (Latium vetus) 490-470 BC.jpg|thumb|right|Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from the acropolis, Temple of Mater Matuta, 490-470 BC, from [[Satricum]]]]\nEven though erudite scholars have been trying to ascertain the location of the ancient towns of Latium for at least the last four centuries (see Cluvier), and despite the recent progress made by archaeology in the field of the human settlement of ancient Latium, only a few towns of archaic Latium cited by ancient sources have been identified with certainty, whereas a remarkable number of settlements that have been unearthed remain unidentified. This is due to the lack of epigraphic confirmation, due to the rare use of writing in archaic times. The problem is made even more difficult because some of the ancient locations were possibly resettled during the [[Early Middle Ages]], as was probably the case for Labicum and Collatia. A good instance of such a custom is provided by Falerii outside Latium Vetus.  Towns which have been identified archaeologically include Satricum, Politorium, Ficana, Tellenae, Crustumerium, Corniculum, Antemnae, Collatia, Fidenae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Apiolae, Gabii and perhaps Querquetulum. [[Alba Longa]], Pometia and Corioli remain unidentified. Traces of the presence of the Ligures and Sicels remain in the [[toponymy]] and [[onomastics]].<ref>See the works by  G. Sergi, F. Ribezzo, G. Devoto, G. Alessio and A. Grandazzi cited below.</ref>\n\nThe most conspicuous case and one which has given rise to long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by [[Ascanius]] and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.<ref>A. Grandazzi \"La localisation d' Alba\" in  MEFRA 1986. See section below.</ref>\n\n===Amitinum===\nThis centre was located to the east of Rome on the Corniculan Mountains, not far from Curniculum. Its identification is due to an inscription that mentions a ''pagus amentinus''.<ref>CIL VI 251.</ref>\n\n===Antemnae===\nThe town of Antemnae was located three miles to the north of Rome on the left bank of the river Anio and close to its confluence with the Tiber. Its name means \"between the rivers\" (Antemnae is the Sabine for Latin ''interamnes''). Some of its ruins were discovered in 1880 during excavations to build the fortress \"Forte Antenne\". Later excavations yielded additional material. The location is now within the urban area of Rome.\n\nAntemnae was colonised by Rome at the time of Romolus during the first effort to control the left bank of the Tiber up to the Anio, thus ensuring a communication  route with Etruria along the Via Salaria. The Antemnates and the Caeninenses were granted full Roman citizenship. Nevertheless, the town revolted several times, the last time in 507 BC.<ref>Dionysius Hal. V 21.</ref>\n\n===Apiolae===\nDestroyed by [[Tarquinius Priscus]], the remains have been identified and excavated. The town was located on Monte Savello between [[Albano Laziale|Albano]] and [[Pavona]]. It housed a temple of Apollo and the famous spring of [[Juturna]], with nearby Lake Turni being the object of a local cult. Today the two water sources are known as the spring of Secciano and the Laghetto di Pavona.\n\n===Aefulae===\nThe site of the settlement of the Alban people Aesulani has been identified with the hilltop castrum of Aefulae near ancient Tibur and close to the site of one of the temples of [[Bona Dea]]. It was deserted by the original dwellers and later resettled by the Romans, who turned it into a military fort.<ref>Aesulae is the Latin pronunciatiation of a Sabine Aefulae i.e. meaning Aedules.</ref>\n\n===Bolae===\nThe site of the Alban people Bolani is frequently mentioned by the historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. It was occupied by the Aequians probably already in the late 6th century or in the wars led by [[Coriolanus]].<ref>Dion. Hal. VIII 18.</ref> Its site is not known with certainty, but it must have stood not far from Praeneste and Labicum.\n\n===Corioli===\nThe site of this settlement must have stood on the south-west side of the Alban Hills near Genzano and Lanuvium.\n\n===Pedum===\nThe most important of the Latin towns developed from the ancient ''populi albenses'', [[Pedum]] stood between Tibur and Praeneste near modern [[Gallicano nel Lazio]]. It was taken by the Romans with Coriolanus.<ref>Livy II 39; Plutarch ''Cor.'' 28.</ref> After the final demise of the Latin League, the town declined.\n\n===Tolerium===\nThis settlement of the Alban people was probably not far from Pedum, according to a passage in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (7.26).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438853 |title=Places: 438853 (Tolerium) |author=Purcell, N., R.

It may have been located near present-day \"La Rustica\" close to the [[Aniene|Anio river]], on a trade route connecting Latium with Etruria and Campania.<ref>P. Zaccagni in ''Civilt\u00e1 del Lazio primitivo. Catalogo della Mostra'' Roma 1976 p. 155.</ref> Festus states it was close to the old Roman settlement. It was originally a settlement of the Sicels, as was Antemnae, who were later expelled by the Aborigenes.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' II 35, 7.</ref>  Dionysius records a tradition according to which Romulus was at Caenina for a sacrifice during the festival of the [[Lupercalia]], which was the occasion of the abduction of [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] by Numitor's shepherds.<ref>Dionysius ''Roman Antiquities'' II 89.</ref> The town underwent [[synoecism]] and some of its cults and  priests (''sacerdotes'') were transferred to Rome<ref>R.

Wissowa  RE  1279.</ref> by Romulus, who celebrated his first triumph after conquering the Caeninenses and killing their king, [[Acron]]. However, according to Dionysius, Romulus allowed the Caeninenses to continue to live in their hometown, although they had to accept a colony of three hundred Romans and the allotment to them of one third of their land.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 35, 3-5.</ref> The town is still mentioned at the beginning of the Republic: the Vindicius who revealed the plot of the Aquilii to [[Publius Valerius Publicola]]  was a slave from Caenina captured in war.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' V 7, 3.</ref>\n\nThe town name may be related to Latin ''caenum'' (mud, lime), itself a word with no Indoeuropean etymology.<ref>G. Alessio \"Problemi storico-linguistici messapici\" in ''Studi salentini'' 1962 '''14''' p. 318 n. 131.</ref> Another possibility is that it was of Celtic (Ligurian) origin.\n\n===Cameria or Camerium===\nSince Romulus made this town into a Roman colony, it fought many wars against Rome. In 502 BC it was destroyed, and its ruins have not yet been found; it was located to the north-east of Rome.\n\n===Collatia===\nStrabo places [[Collatia]] some 30 [[stadia (length)|stades]] from Rome. Though by his time it had been reduced to farmland. The location of the site has not yet been identified with certainty, but it was located near modern [[Lunghezza]], to the east of Rome. Likely it stood on the hill now occupied by the [[Castello di Lunghezza]]; which lies at the terminus of the ancient [[Via Collatina]]. The town was conquered and colonized by the Romans. Livy preserves the formula of their surrender, often cited as example of the [[deditio in fide]].\n\nCollatia was founded by the Latin king [[Alba Silvius|Silvius]] of Alba Longa and it was the hometown of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], one of the first two consuls of the Roman Republic.\n\n===Curniculum or Corniculum===\nThe town has been located by modern scholars in the present position of [[Montecelio]] (formerly Monticelli) in the comune of [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]], not far from [[Tibur]]. The two adjacent hills shaped like a pair of horns were the source of its name, and the nearby mountain range is still known as \"Monti Cornicolani\". \n\nNear Montecelio, relics dating from the [[Iron Age]] and fragments of pottery from the 7th-6th centuries BC have been discovered. The town was destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus<ref>Livy I 38; 39. Dionysius III 50; IV 1. Ovid  Fasti VI 627 ff.</ref> and was believed to be the hometown of [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother, Ocresia.\n\n===Crustumerium or Crustumeria===\nThe site of [[Crustumerium]] has been known since the 19th century. It is located in the hills of the Riserva Naturale park of Marcigliana Vecchia, to the north of Rome near Settebagni, on the [[Via Salaria]]. The town was also known as ''Castrimoenium'' and ''Crustumeria'' and has given its name to the surrounding countryside and hills known as \"Ager Crustuminus\" and \"Montes Crustumini\". According to Servius it was originally a settlement of the [[Sicels]],  founded by the Sicel Clitemnestrus.<ref>Servius Danielis \"ad Aeneidem\" VII 631 = Cassius Hemina fragm. 2 Peter.</ref> The etymology of the name is unclear and may reflect an ancient Pre-Indo European toponymic ''crustulum'', meaning pond.<ref>Ambra Costanzo Garancini, ''La romanizzazione nel bacino idrografico padano attraverso l\u2019odierna idronimia'', Firenze, La Nuova Italia, 1975 (Pubblicazioni della Facolt\u00e0 di Lettere e Filosofia dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, 75), p. 124.</ref>\n\nCrustumerium has been and is still being excavated by archaeologists and its study has been important for understanding urban development in Old Latium. It was located on one of the routes that linked [[Veii]] and [[Gabii]], close to a ford on the Tiber, which fact, along with the richness of its countryside, was the cause of its importance and wealth.<ref name=\"QuiliciGigli1980\">{{cite book|author1=Lorenzo Quilici|author2=Stefania Quilici Gigli|title=Crustumerium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JREvAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche, Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica}}</ref>\n\nThe town stretched along a road trench and occupied an area of 60 hectares. It had walls that were a complex made by four or five parallel stretches connected by normal ones and covered with stone slabs. Tombs contained a rich production of fine pottery painted in white and red, weapons, and other instruments from the early Iron Age onward. \n\nThe town is mentioned in the Aeneid, and in the history of Rome it was involved in the abduction of the Sabine women and the subsequent war. Further, Romulus is said to have installed a colony of Romans there. Later it is frequently mentioned in the wars between Rome and its neighbors. \n\nLiterary sources put the destruction of Crustumerium at the end of the sixth century,<ref>Livy II 19.</ref> but archaeologists have shown it was still occupied in the fifth century and declined only in the fourth century.<ref>A. Amoroso \"Crustumerium: a frontier settlement\" in ''Bollettino di Archeologia'' 2001.</ref>\n\n===Ficana===\n[[Ficana]] was located  on the left bank of the Tiber, downstream from Rome, near present-day [[Acilia]] on the highland over Monte Cugno. In ancient times, this provided an advantage as it was steeper and a dominant position on the river. Its identification is confirmed by the find of an inscription. The sources state that it was destroyed twice by Ancus Marcius in his drive to control the lower course of the Tiber and the salines, together with Politorium and Tellenae. Its importance was owed to the fact it was a port that afforded a commercial route to the hinterland toward the Alban Hills and Aricia.\n\nArchaeologists have shown that it was still a prosperous centre during the 4th century and reached its maximum expansion after the Roman conquest. It declined only in the 4th and 3rd centuries after the development of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]. Excavations have unearthed the town wall, housing areas and a necropolis. Long-necked [[amphora]]s  decorated with reliefs or scratches of a style typical of 7th-century Old Latium testify to the early quality of the local material culture. The Ficana site is now an archaeological park.{{When|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Medullium===\nAlso known in the sources as [[Medullia]], its exact location is unknown. It was the hometown of [[Hostus Hostilius]]'s family and was conquered by Tullus Hostilius, although not destroyed. Its name suggests a relationship to the Ligurian tribe of the Medulli (Medylloi in Strabon IV 1, 11) and would appear to be cognate with the Celtic deity Meduna.<ref>G. Alessio \"Genti e favelle dell'antica Apulia\" Cressati Taranto 1949 p. 17 n. 3 (= ''Archivio Storico Pugliese''  II 1949) citing Holder ''Altceltische Sprache'' II col. 528: cfr. German ''Met''.</ref> Strabo<ref>IV 6.</ref> mentions two other towns named Medullia, one on the western alps in Gallia and one on the eastern alps in Iapudia.\n\n===Politorium===\n[[Politorium]] has been identified in the archaic settlement found near [[Castel di Decima]], south-east of Rome, but this identification lacks epigraphic confirmation. It is mentioned by Cato, who records its founding, and by Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassos, who describe its capture and successive demolition by Ancus Marcius. Its inhabitants would have been deported to the Aventine. These facts are part of the first expansive drive by Rome toward the sea, which also brought about the fall of Ficana and Tellenae.\n\nThe excavations have uncovered remains of the fortifications and a princely necropolis.\n\n===Satricum===\n[[Satricum]] was recorded by Pliny as the first in his list of ''clara oppida''. It was an important and ancient settlement of the Latin and other tribes and arose near the prehistoric sanctuary of [[Mater Matuta]]. It has been identified by archaeologists at Le Ferriere, in the present [[Province of Latina]], and it was systematically excavated by the Royal Dutch Institute in Rome in collaboration with Italian authorities. During excavations in 1977 the inscription known as [[Lapis Satricanus]] was unearthed.<ref name=\"Stibbe1980\">{{cite book|author=C. M.

Its location has not been identified, with some scholars suggesting that it was located near Tibur or near Passerano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438829 |title=Places: 438829 (Scaptia) |author=Purcell, N., R.

Helbig ''Die Italiker in der Poebene'' 1879.</ref> [[Giuseppe Sergi]]<ref>G. Sergi ''Da Albalonga a Roma. Inizio dell'incivilimento in Italia, ovvero Liguri e Siculi'' Turin 1934 p. 3ff.</ref> remarked that the early name of the Tiber was Albula, a name that recurs elsewhere in [[hydronymy]] where there are traces of Ligurians and Sicels.<ref>The Albula, a source near Tibur. The Albula oracle in Virgil's Aeneis. An Albula river in Picenum near Numana, town that Pliny NH III 13 ascribes to the Sicels; another one in the Lepontine Alps; one in the Grisons canton of present day Switzerland. The Albinia river in Etruria (now [[Albegna]]), a river Alba in Sicily and another one in Northeast Spain.</ref> Further evidence connecting Ligures and Siculi was provided by a neolithic skeleton unearthed at Sgurgola near [[Anagni]] that was painted red, as were the ones found in the Ligurian cave of the \"[[Arene Candide]]\". Sergi concluded that Ligures and Siceli were in fact just one [[ethnic group]], but since they lived far apart, they had come to be considered as two distinct nations. Their identity could be confirmed by ancient [[toponymy|toponyms]] found in Latium as well as other regions of Italy. Strabon also mentions that a former name for the Alps was Albia.\n\nOther correspondences include the ancient name of the [[Lake of Bracciano]], ''Sabatinus Lacus'' and the town of Sabate on its shores, and the river S\u0101pis in Umbria, names based on a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] root *s\u0101b- meaning water, seen also in the name [[Vada Sabatia]] (today [[Vado Ligure]]).<ref>C.

In the lowlands, cereals and legumes were grown. In the hills, grapes were planted, and wines such as Setinus, Albanus, and Signinus, were of good quality.<ref>Strabo V 3, 2; V 3, 10.</ref> In the highlands, animal husbandry took the place of food production as an economic force.     \n\n[[Gabii]] had famous quarries of red [[travertine]] stone, which was used as building material in the surrounding area, Rome included.<ref>Strabo V 3, 10-11.</ref> Crafts, such as smithing and pottery, were also developed. \n\nDiseases like [[malaria]] were restricted to coastal areas and a few other locations.\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Latium]] \u2014 ''all periods''.\n* [[New Latium]]\n* {{C|History of Lazio}}\n* {{C|History of Rome}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Latium vetus}}\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n{{Ancient Rome topics|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:History of Rome|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:History of Lazio|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of Italy|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Metropolitan City of Rome Capital|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Latial culture]]\n", "name_user": "2dk", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Latium"}

In her study of food sciences, she was introduced to biochemistry and microbiology, which led her to study DNA manipulation. She then received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from [[Ohio State University]] in 1986. She continued to work at OSU for three more years in a post-doctoral position studying gene regulation in fungi. During her time at OSU, she cloned numerous genes important for nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in ''Neurospora''. One of these genes, cys-3, encodes a leucine zipper protein. It was hypothesized that leucine zippers were DNA-binding elements. The first proof of this in living organisms was a mutation in the cys-3 leucine zipper, which caused a sulfur metabolism defect. After studying the mutation, Fu demonstrated that the mutated cys-3 was unable to bind DNA.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://scienceofsleep.org/bio-eng/|title = Science of Sleep - Biography|date = |accessdate = |website = Science of Sleep|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Fu transferred to the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a post-doctoral fellow to study human genetics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Neurogenetics: Ying-Hui Fu|url = http://www.neugenes.org/yinghuifu.htm|website = www.neugenes.org|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}</ref> While there, she was part of the team that identified the [[Fragile X syndrome|fragile-X]] syndrome gene.

This woman and her family would become the subject of study for Fu and her collaborator Louis Ptacek for [[Advanced sleep phase disorder#Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome|familial advanced sleep phase]] syndrome (FASPS). They cloned the causative gene/mutation and studied the ''in vitro'' biochemical consequences of the mutation, culminating in a 2001 paper<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11232563 | doi=10.1126/science.1057499 | volume=291 | title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome | date=February 2001 | journal=Science | pages=1040\u20133  | last1 = Toh | first1 = KL | last2 = Jones | first2 = CR | last3 = He | first3 = Y | display-authors = etal}}</ref> An h''Per2'' phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome, reporting the first circadian gene mutation in humans.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Scientists Search for the Best Sleepers|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-search-for-the-best-sleepers-1402354792|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = June 9, 2014|access-date = April 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Sumathi|last = Reddy}}</ref>\n\n====Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome====\nIn 2001, Fu and her collaborator's labs published a paper that explained a phenotype of extremely early risers in humans called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=KL|date=2001|title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5506|pages=1040\u20133|doi=10.1126/science.1057499|pmid=11232563|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1040T|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.460}}</ref> Humans with this [[autosomal dominant]] disease typically go to bed around 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and wake up at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. The lab studied the genomes of people with this trait and found a point mutation in the [[PER2]] gene that likely causes the behavioral phenotype.\n\n====Short sleep phenotype====\nIn 2009, Fu's group published a paper that explained the mechanisms of a short sleep phenotype in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Y|date=2009|title=Transcriptional suppressor DEC2 is a Regulator for Human Sleep Homeostasis|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5942|pages=866\u2013870|doi=10.1126/science.1174443|pmc=2884988|pmid=19679812}}</ref> In one family, carriers of the  [[autosomal dominant]] phenotype sleep 6.25 hours compared to non-carrying family members, who sleep more than 8 hours per night. Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called [[DEC2]] that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a [[proline]]-to-[[arginine]] switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. [[Transgenic]] mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes. It is not currently known what other molecules DEC2 interacts with to produce the short sleep phenotype.\n\n===Neurodegeneration===\n\n==== Trinucleotide repeat expansions and neurological diseases ====\nWhen Fu did her post-doctoral work in Baylor College, she was part of the team that was positional cloning the Fragile-X syndrome gene. There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA. This mutational mechanism is now known to cause not only Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy, but also Huntington's disease and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Thus, it is a common mutational mechanism in inherited neurological diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.

genetics of many neurological disorders. Her chief discoveries include describing Mendelian sleep phenotypes, identifying causative genes and mutations for [[circadian rhythm]] disorders, and characterizing genetic forms of [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating degenerative disorders]]. Fu is currently a professor of neurology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. She was elected to the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/05/410331/2-ucsf-faculty-elected-national-academy-sciences-2018|title=2 UCSF Faculty Elected to the National Academy of Sciences for 2018|last=Bai|first=Nina|date=2018-05-02|website=UC San Francisco|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Background and education==\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn 1980, Fu received a degree in food science from [[National Chung-Hsing University]] in Taiwan. In her study of food sciences, she was introduced to biochemistry and microbiology, which led her to study DNA manipulation. She then received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from [[Ohio State University]] in 1986. She continued to work at OSU for three more years in a post-doctoral position studying gene regulation in fungi. During her time at OSU, she cloned numerous genes important for nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in ''Neurospora''. One of these genes, cys-3, encodes a leucine zipper protein. It was hypothesized that leucine zippers were DNA-binding elements. The first proof of this in living organisms was a mutation in the cys-3 leucine zipper, which caused a sulfur metabolism defect. After studying the mutation, Fu demonstrated that the mutated cys-3 was unable to bind DNA.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://scienceofsleep.org/bio-eng/|title = Science of Sleep - Biography|date = |accessdate = |website = Science of Sleep|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Fu transferred to the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a post-doctoral fellow to study human genetics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Neurogenetics: Ying-Hui Fu|url = http://www.neugenes.org/yinghuifu.htm|website = www.neugenes.org|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}</ref> While there, she was part of the team that identified the [[Fragile X syndrome|fragile-X]] syndrome gene. The gene contains a polymorphic CGG trinucleotide repeat in their DNA sequence; the repeat ranged from 6 to 54 in individuals with normal X chromosomes.

They cloned the causative gene/mutation and studied the ''in vitro'' biochemical consequences of the mutation, culminating in a 2001 paper<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11232563 | doi=10.1126/science.1057499 | volume=291 | title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome | date=February 2001 | journal=Science | pages=1040\u20133  | last1 = Toh | first1 = KL | last2 = Jones | first2 = CR | last3 = He | first3 = Y | display-authors = etal}}</ref> An h''Per2'' phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome, reporting the first circadian gene mutation in humans.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Scientists Search for the Best Sleepers|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-search-for-the-best-sleepers-1402354792|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = June 9, 2014|access-date = April 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Sumathi|last = Reddy}}</ref>\n\n====Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome====\nIn 2001, Fu and her collaborator's labs published a paper that explained a phenotype of extremely early risers in humans called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=KL|date=2001|title=An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5506|pages=1040\u20133|doi=10.1126/science.1057499|pmid=11232563|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1040T|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.460}}</ref> Humans with this [[autosomal dominant]] disease typically go to bed around 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and wake up at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. The lab studied the genomes of people with this trait and found a point mutation in the [[PER2]] gene that likely causes the behavioral phenotype.\n\n====Short sleep phenotype====\nIn 2009, Fu's group published a paper that explained the mechanisms of a short sleep phenotype in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Y|date=2009|title=Transcriptional suppressor DEC2 is a Regulator for Human Sleep Homeostasis|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5942|pages=866\u2013870|doi=10.1126/science.1174443|pmc=2884988|pmid=19679812}}</ref> In one family, carriers of the  [[autosomal dominant]] phenotype sleep 6.25 hours compared to non-carrying family members, who sleep more than 8 hours per night. Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called [[DEC2]] that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a [[proline]]-to-[[arginine]] switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. [[Transgenic]] mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes. It is not currently known what other molecules DEC2 interacts with to produce the short sleep phenotype.\n\n===Neurodegeneration===\n\n==== Trinucleotide repeat expansions and neurological diseases ====\nWhen Fu did her post-doctoral work in Baylor College, she was part of the team that was positional cloning the Fragile-X syndrome gene. There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA. This mutational mechanism is now known to cause not only Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy, but also Huntington's disease and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Thus, it is a common mutational mechanism in inherited neurological diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.

In the earlier stages of the team's formation the club did not enjoy much success.\n\n=== Early Success ===\nIn the 2007/08 season the club won their first silverware under Manager Richard Williams winning the Central Wales Cup. In the 2007/08 season the club formed a reserves team who went on to win the North Powys Ladies League Division 2 undefeated in their first season. In 2008/09 the Club really showed how far they had come winning the treble, The County Times Cup, The North Powys Ladies league and successfully defending the Central Wales Cup, with the reserve team also finishing runners up in Division 2.\n\n=== New Challenge of the National Premier League ===\nWith the club currently dominating Mid Wales Football they were chosen, as one of 8 clubs throughout Wales, to form a National League. The League was initially divided into two divisions, North and South, with Llanidloes playing in the North. However, as the league was initially small they could continue to play in the North Powys League whilst still fulfilling their Premier fixtures. The Club made Welsh Ladies Football history playing in the first Welsh National League fixture against Aberystwyth in September 2009.\n\nFor the 2009/10 season the North Powys league Division 1 and 2 merged to form a larger more competitive League. This meant that the Reserves Team had to form a completely independent squad, so Llanidloes Reserves became Llanidloes Daffs for the new season. In the season 2009/2010 the club repeated it treble winning performances from the previous season again lifting the County Times Cup, The North Powys Ladies league and the Central Wales Cup. Llanidloes in 2010 had lifted the Central Wales Cup in three consecutive seasons.\n\nLlanidloes Ladies also had another milestone in 2009 when Nikki Bocking was called into the Wales Under 17s squad travelling to Belgium in September and Macedonia in October 2009.<ref>UEFA Website</ref>\n\n=== The new single format Premier League ===\nIn its first three years the Welsh Women`s Premier League was divided into two conferences, north and south, with Llanidloes competing in the North. The league changed the format to a single division for the 2012\u201313 season. When the league became a single division it meant Llanidloes could no longer play in the North Powys League.\nThe club renamed itself Hafren United before the 2014/15 season but withdrew before playing their first match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hafren United Withdraw from WPWL|url=http://www.welshpremier.org/news/Hafren-United-Withdraw-from-WPWL/97599/|publisher=welshpremier.org|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=1 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908133327/http://www.welshpremier.org/news/Hafren-United-Withdraw-from-WPWL/97599/|archive-date=8 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Reforming ===\nLlanidloes Ladies reformed in the summer of 2017 and entered the North Wales Women's Football League due to the lack of a Central Wales League.

In the earlier stages of the teams formation the club did not enjoy much success.\n\n=== Early Success ===\nIn the 2007/08 season the club won their first silverware under Manager Richard Williams winning the Central Wales Cup. In the 2007/08 season the club formed a reserves team who went on to win the North Powys Ladies League Division 2 undefeated in their first season. In 2008/09 the Club really showed how far they had come winning the treble, The County Times Cup, The North Powys Ladies league and successfully defending the Central Wales Cup, with the reserve team also finishing runners up in Division 2.\n\n=== New Challenge of the National Premier League ===\nWith the club currently dominating Mid Wales Football they were chosen, as one of 8 clubs throughout Wales, to form a National League. The League was initially divided into two divisions, North and South, with Llanidloes playing in the North. However, as the league was initially small they could continue to play in the North Powys League whilst still fulfilling their Premier fixtures. The Club made Welsh Ladies Football history playing in the first Welsh National League fixture against Aberystwyth in September 2009.\n\nFor the 2009/10 season the North Powys league Division 1 and 2 merged to form a larger more competitive League. This meant that the Reserves Team had to form a completely independent squad, so Llanidloes Reserves became Llanidloes Daffs for the new season. In the season 2009/2010 the club repeated it treble winning performances from the previous season again lifting the County Times Cup, The North Powys Ladies league and the Central Wales Cup. Llanidloes in 2010 had lifted the Central Wales Cup in three consecutive seasons.\n\nLlanidloes Ladies also had another milestone in 2009 when Nikki Bocking was called into the Wales Under 17s squad travelling to Belgium in September and Macedonia in October 2009.<ref>UEFA Website</ref>\n\n=== The new single format Premier League ===\nIn its first three years the Welsh Women`s Premier League was divided into two conferences, north and south, with Llanidloes competing in the North. The league changed the format to a single division for the 2012\u201313 season. When the league became a single division it meant Llanidloes could no longer play in the North Powys League.\nThe club renamed itself Hafren United before the 2014/15 season but withdrew before playing their first match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hafren United Withdraw from WPWL|url=http://www.welshpremier.org/news/Hafren-United-Withdraw-from-WPWL/97599/|publisher=welshpremier.org|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=1 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908133327/http://www.welshpremier.org/news/Hafren-United-Withdraw-from-WPWL/97599/|archive-date=8 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Reforming ===\nLlanidloes Ladies reformed in the summer of 2017 and entered the North Wales Women's Football League due to the lack of a Central Wales League.

It also pointed out the strong efficacy of the drug, and laid out the costs of managing CF that would be saved for people that the drug could treat; those costs include repeated hospitalizations and lung transplants.<ref name=MIT>Barry Werth  for MIT Technology Review.

It justified the price\u2014one of the highest in the world for any drug\u2014by explaining that on the one hand, that it can only treat about 4% of CF patients, or about 3,000 people worldwide; as it was only approved for adults and children six and older, there are only about 2,400 people eligible to receive it; with that few people, it needed a high price in order to pay for the research to create it as well as its other programs, which include a drug candidate that could treat many more people with CF. It also pointed out the strong efficacy of the drug, and laid out the costs of managing CF that would be saved for people that the drug could treat; those costs include repeated hospitalizations and lung transplants.<ref name=MIT>Barry Werth  for MIT Technology Review.

CFF struck a similar agreement with the company, Altus Pharmaceuticals, to fund development of a recombinant enzyme that could treat pancreatic disease in people with cystic fibrosis. When Altus reported to CFF that it didn't have funds to continue developing the drug, CFF seized control of the asset and eventually licensed it to Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which developed the drug further and was acquired by [[Eli Lilly]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alnara's Late-Stage Pancreatic Enzyme Drives Lilly Acquisition|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/alnaras-late-stage-pancreatic-enzyme-drives-lilly-acquisition-0|work=BioWorld|date=July 6, 2010|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ledford|first1=H|title=Charities seek cut of drug royalties.|journal=Nature|date=20 July 2011|volume=475|issue=7356|pages=275\u20136|pmid=21776052|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110720/full/475275a.html|doi=10.1038/475275a|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism of venture philanthropy in education==\n\nUW-Madison Professor Emeritus Kenneth Zeichner wrote a paper criticizing the role of the New Schools Venture Fund in bringing deregulation and market-based practices into schools in the US.<ref>Staff, UW-Madison School of Education News June 20, 2014 [https://www.education.wisc.edu/soe/news-events/news/2014/06/20/paper-co-authored-by-zeichner-examines-growing-role-of-venture-philanthropy Paper co-authored by Zeichner examines growing role of venture philanthropy]</ref> Lois Weiner writing in ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' criticized teachers' unions for taking money from the [[Gates Foundation]].<ref>Lois Weiner for The Jacobin.
