After Eve suffers psychological problems and Ken descends into alcoholism, the children are placed in foster care. Will leaves and Hayley runs away to join him living with [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]).\n\nHayley quickly befriends [[Sam Marshall]] ([[Ryan Clark (actor)|Ryan Clark]]) and they begin to [[graffiti]] tag various areas in the Bay. They begin dating. While out walking one day, the couple are taken hostage by a drifter named Murray ([[Scott Major]]) who held up the diner. They are eventually rescued by Will. Hayley and Sam continue tagging until their friend Brian Matthews (Scott Swalwell) dies in a fall. Shortly after, Ken reappears and Hayley is keen to reconnect with him but Will isn't so easily swayed and is still hostile towards him. Ken leaves but later returns permanently and falls for Irene.\n\nHayley soon finds herself in a love triangle with Sam and the newly arrived [[Mitch McColl]] ([[Cameron Welsh]]). She eventually chooses Mitch. Their relationship lasts until Mitch reveals that he slept with [[Gypsy Nash]] ([[Kimberley Cooper]]). Soon after Nick rejoins the family and things appear to be going well until Ken is killed when a car he is working on, crushes him after a jack slips. Hayley slides into a downward spiral and is nearly attacked at a nightclub one evening. [[Noah Lawson]] ([[Beau Brady]]) is on the scene to save her and they ride off on his motorbike. They soon begin a relationship.\n\nAfter failing Year 12 due to the stress of Ken's death, Hayley decides to repeat and Noah joins her. School principal [[Donald Fisher (Home and Away)|Donald Fisher]] ([[Norman Coburn]]) asks her to do the illustrations for his Children's book ''Letter to Byron'' dedicated to his late son. When the book is launched, Hayley sees a vision of Ken in the crowd.\n\nHayley's relationship with Noah is tested when she catches him kissing Skye Patterson ([[Angela Keep]]) at her 18th birthday party and soon after Noah spirals into alcoholism and matters are not helped when Hayley befriends Noah's overly-religious mother, Jill ([[Tracy Mann]]).\n\nWhen Donald goes to launch his book in [[London]], he invites Hayley, Irene, Will and Nick join him on the trip. While there Hayley meets a porter, Robbie Jamison (Rupert Evans) and falls for him and they have one date. Robbie asks Hayley to stay with him in London but she declines, realising she still loves Noah. After arriving home, Hayley reconciles with Noah.\n\nHayley and Noah later move into their own place together which they name \"The Palace\". After Hayley kisses her housemate [[Josh West (Home and Away)|Josh West]] ([[Daniel Collopy]]), she and Noah split but remain housemates. Hayley's relationship with Josh does not last very long after [[Alf Stewart]] ([[Ray Meagher]]) tells her of his visions of Hayley marrying Josh and becoming unhappy.\n\nHayley's next relationship is with her friend [[Alex Poulos]] ([[Danny Raco]]), which lasts several months but when Alex develops a [[steroid]] addiction and [[Brodie Hanson]] ([[Susie Rugg]]), Alex's ex-girlfriend returns things are strained. Hayley and Brodie soon find themselves at loggerheads and both are seriously injured in a car crash after an argument. Hayley is later left disfigured and has lost her memory. Alex and Brodie try to break the news to Hayley that they are back together but are unable to do so and give her a story that they are both going away for a while. Hayley slowly regains her memory and Noah is there to comfort her.\n\nOn her 21st birthday, Hayley receives a proposal from Noah and she accepts. The couple later marry in an outdoor ceremony where Ken reappears to Hayley as she walks down the aisle. [[Kane Phillips|Kane]] ([[Sam Atwell]]) and [[Kirsty Phillips]] ([[Christie Hayes]]) also renew their vows on the day. Their marriage is cut short when Noah is shot dead in an armed siege with Sarah Lewis (Luisa Hastings-Edge), leaving Hayley widowed. After finding paintings that seemingly appear at the palace, Hayley begins to become confused despite the fact she painted them. [[Kit Hunter]] ([[Amy Mizzi]]) tells Hayley that she stole the paintings the previous year and a vision of Noah told her to return the paintings.\n\nHayley finds herself in a love triangle with [[Scott Hunter (Home and Away)|Scott Hunter]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) and [[Kim Hyde]] ([[Chris Hemsworth]]). She later falls pregnant and is unsure who the father is. The baby is initially believed to be Kim's and Scott steps aside. However, Hayley is still in love with Scott, but plans to marry Kim. On the day of the day of the wedding, Hayley runs away and Scott searches for her and eventually finds her as she goes into labour. Hayley then gives birth to a baby boy and names him after Noah. By the end of the year, it is revealed that Kim is not Noah's father, as his blood type does not match the child.

The series is set in the fictional Albert Memorial Hospital and is primarily concerned with romances between younger members of the hospital staff, rather than typical medical issues and procedures. The program was shown in numerous international locations, throughout the United Kingdom and North America, and also in France and Spain.\n\n==Series history==\n\nThe series was created and devised by [[Alan Coleman]] with [[Reg Watson]] acting as Executive Producer. Watson had been the Producer of the British soap opera ''[[Crossroads (British TV series)|Crossroads]]'' from 1964-1972 and he moved back to Australia to help set up a new drama department within the Reg Grundy Organisation, which at the time, was better known for its game shows. With Coleman directing, and Watson's experience of producing fast-turnaround, 5-days a week serial drama, ''The Young Doctors'' became the third [[soap opera]] produced by the [[Reg Grundy Organisation]] following ''[[Class of 74]] / 75'' for the Seven Network, and ''[[Until Tomorrow]]'', which also briefly aired on [[Seven Network]] in 1975.\n\n''The Young Doctors'' began in November 1976, a week earlier than another new soap opera on Nine, ''[[The Sullivans]]'', which was produced for the network by [[Crawford Productions]]. [[Nine Network]] made it clear only one of the series would be commissioned beyond the initial 13 week production run.\n\nAfter the 13-week trial period ''The Sullivans'', which had a budget which was three times bigger than ''The Young Doctors'', emerged as the critical success, so ''The Young Doctors'' was cancelled. Fans lobbied Nine Network, who then decided to reverse their decision and by popular demand ''The Young Doctors'' continued in its daily 6.00 pm slot and had a successful run of six and a half years, making it one of Australia's longest running and popular serials of the time. After several years however, many long-serving cast members began to leave, so during the final season in 1982\u201383, many new characters were added in an attempt to modernise and refresh the long-running serial.\n\nProducer and co-creator [[Alan Coleman]] also left in early 1982, and he was replaced by Sue Masters twelve months before the series finished production in late November 1982. Masters went on to produce Grundy's replacement medical soap, ''Starting Out'' for Nine, and then Grundy's stablemate ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' from 1983. Several cast members from ''The Young Doctors'' including [[Judy McBurney]], [[Genevieve Lemon]], [[Babs McMillan]], [[Tottie Goldsmith]] and [[Peter Bensley]] all went into leading roles in ''Prisoner'' after ''The Young Doctors'' finished production.\n\nThe advent of [[one-day cricket]] led to Nine Network moving the show around the schedules. The loss of several popular cast members also  contributed to a sharp decline in ratings, and as a consequence of this, the series was moved to a mid-afternoon timeslot and then cancelled in late 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theyoungdoctors.com/show/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807123809/http://www.theyoungdoctors.com/show/history.htm |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen the series ended after 1396 episodes, it held the record of Australia's longest-running commercial television drama serial, which was previously held by ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]''. This was later surpassed by ''[[A Country Practice]]'' and then ''[[Neighbours]]'', which is currently the longest-running Australian drama serial. ''The Young Doctors'' also holds the distinction, rare among long-running Australian dramas, of having never won any sort of television award.\n\n''The Young Doctors'' final episode aired on Nine Network on March 30, 1983 at 14:30, and, coincidentally, ''The Sullivans'' had also ended just two weeks earlier.\n\nNine Network and Grundy's launched several new soap operas in an attempt to fill the gaps left in their early-evening schedule. First, in July 1982, there was an attempt to emulate the opulence and grandeur of American prime-time soaps such as ''Dallas'' and ''Dynasty'' and Reg Watson came up with ''[[Taurus Rising]]'' which had a short, but eventful 21-episode run. Grundy's reportedly spent over $1 million on the opening episodes alone and the series was also notably recorded entirely on film rather than the standard videotape presentation. This notorious series went on to become popular when broadcast internationally, particularly in 1984 when it aired in syndication on some US TV networks.\n\nNext, in February 1983, Grundy's and Nine launched'' [[Waterloo Station (TV series)|Waterloo Station]]'', a series focused on two sisters, both married to policemen, and their adult children starting careers in the police force. After a month of poor ratings, and just 40 episodes, Nine pulled it from the schedules and quickly  launched ''[[Starting Out]]'', which was set around a group of young medical students at a boarding house. However, this series also quickly flopped and was discontinued after only 85 episodes had been produced.\n\nFinally, in 1985, came ''[[Possession (TV series)|Possession]]'' which started promisingly with an intriguing espionage story before giving way to the usual soap-opera [[Trope (cinema)|tropes]]. Although it lasted long enough to give the producers a chance to revamp the storylines and characters to try and save the series, when Nine moved it out of primetime, it became clear that ''Possession'' was never going to be a success. Cutting their losses, the series was pulled after just 6 months and Grundy's and Nine Network did not attempt to launch another soap opera again, with ''The Young Doctors'' remaining Grundy's sole soap opera success on the network.\n\n==Story and setting==\nDespite the medical setting, medical procedures rarely featured in storylines, with most of the stories and plots focusing more on the personal life, romances and dramas of the staff. All scenes were played out in the various sets forming the Albert Memorial Hospital. A memorial plaque situated on the wall of the studio set of the hospital's exterior stated the hospital opened in 1889 and it is also established early in the series that the Albert Memorial is located in a [[Sydney]] district, with Sydney generically referred to as 'the City'.\n\nThe most regularly seen set was the large hospital entrance lobby containing a reception desk, refreshments kiosk, a lift and stairs to the upper floors, and swinging double-doors that led into the casualty department. Various wards, offices, theatres and small medicine labs all saw an equal amount of romantic and dramatic action over the years. Alan Coleman revealed on a DVD release of the series that the various 'flats' used as sets were simply re-dressed with different hospital equipment and furniture giving the Albert Memorial a sense of monotony often associated with clinical, hospital environments.\n\nLater in ''The Young Doctors'' run, location shooting became  more frequent and viewers saw more of the hospital's exterior and grounds. Scenes filmed outside the hospital now showed modern,  1960's era buildings, presumably extensions to the original Victorian hospital. Exterior shots were filmed at the real life [[Royal North Shore Hospital]] and the former Greenwich Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, which was used for later exterior shots. There was also a Chapel located in the hospital grounds which was filmed on a few occasions, most notably when Julie Holland ([[Lisa Aldenhoven]]) was shot at the [[altar]] on her Wedding day to dashing Doctor Russell Edwards ([[Peter Cousens]]). With location shooting so rare, a trip to Melbourne for a travelogue-style Wedding and tour of the city was an extravagant way to celebrate Liz Kennedy's marriage to Doctor John Forrest in 1981.\n\nThere was also a local bar ''Bunny's'' which was another venue for the staff to mingle. The bar was originally owned by, and named after, Bunny Howard, played by [[Ugly Dave Grey]] who was killed off after the first 65 episodes. ''Bunny's'' was said to be situated on the opposite side of the busy main road to the hospital. Although the bar's exterior was never shown on-screen, its interior regularly featured in every episode for the duration of the 6 and a half year series, appearing in both the first and final episodes.\n\n==Cast and Characters==\n''The Young Doctors'' had a relatively high turnover of young cast playing the doctors and nurses whom featured alongside a more stable roster of longer-running elder cast members. The serial also featured many of today's most well-known Australian actors appearing in their earliest roles. Actress [[Peta Toppano]], who appeared in the first season of ''Prisoner'' in 1979, and later, ''Return to Eden'' in 1986, had previously appeared in ''The Young Doctors'' for just over a year as Doctor Gail Henderson from the first episodes to 1977. Appearing alongside her was future singer, songwriter, and music producer [[Mark Holden]] who played pin-up Doctor Greg Mason for 12 months before his music career took off. At the same time, a lengthy story arc featured [[Mark Hembrow]] in an extended guest role as the (fictional) hugely popular rock singer Georgie Saint. This storyline included the famous 70's pin-up icon [[Abigail (actress)|Abigail]] who completed two stints in the series as assertive secretary, and later Georgie's manager, Hilary Templeton. She would go on to play tragic-heroine Caroline Morrell in ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' the following decade.\n\nParticularly popular during the early years was [[Cornelia Frances]] who played sternly efficient Sister Grace Scott, later Matron. The character was regularly seen irate and disciplining the young nurses in her charge. She was also central to one of ''The Young Doctors'' most famous cliffhangers when Sister Scott accidentally plummeted down an empty lift shaft and broke her leg. Frances would go on to play the equally formidable character Barbara Hamilton in ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' from 1982 to 1986, and then the truly terrifying Judge [[Morag Bellingham]] in numerous stints in ''Home and Away'' from 1988.\n\nAnother star cast member was [[Gwen Plumb]], a recipient of the [[British Empire Medal]] and [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] recipient for her service to the arts and communities service, who portrayed gossipy kiosk lady Ada Simmonds for the length of the series, appearing from episode 2. Ada was very close Dennis Jamison, the hyperactive hospital orderly, played for six years by [[Chris King (actor)|Chris King]] who became a big hit with viewers. Actress [[Joanne Samuel]] was another fan-favourite as Nurse Jill Gordon. The actress was written out of ''The Young Doctors'' by Alan Coleman to allow Samuel the golden opportunity to star in the film ''[[Mad Max]]'' alongside [[Mel Gibson]] in 1979. The film is now widely considered an enduring example of classic Australian cinema.\n\n[[Rebecca Gilling]], who later became an international star due to her iconic role as Stephanie Harper in the hugely successful series ''[[Return to Eden]]'', spent three years in ''The Young Doctors'' as Liz Kennedy. Her character memorably progressed from a first year Nurse to a fully qualified Psychologist before being fatally electrocuted by a faulty lamp on her Wedding night to Doctor John Forrest, an early role for [[Alan Dale]], who later became a star of ''Neighbours'' for eight years as [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]], before going on to appear in many successful U.S drama series and films. Also, ''Neighbours'' current longest running actress, [[Jackie Woodburne]], who has played enduring and wise [[Susan Kennedy]] for over 25 years, was tragic young Nurse Maggie Gordon in ''The Young Doctors'' during 1980\u201381.\n\nAnimal rights activist [[Lynda Stoner]], and [[Paula Duncan]], both left their respective roles in ''The Young Doctors'' to join Crawford's soap ''[[Cop Shop]]''. Duncan would star in this series for its entire run from 1977 to 1984 as Detective Danni Frances. She then joined Network Ten's ''Prisoner'' for its final season in 1986 as regular character Lorelei Wilkinson. After this, it was a starring role in Grundy's replacement soap for ''Prisoner'' on Network Ten, ''[[Richmond Hill (TV series)|Richmond Hill]]'', in 1988 (which also starred Gwen Plumb from ''The Young Doctors'') as Janet Bryant, but this series only lasted one year. A prolific soap star, she then had more guest stints in soaps including ''[[Home and Away]]'' in 1989, ''[[Paradise Beach]]'' in 1993, ''[[Breakers (TV series)|Breakers]]'' in 1997, and also ''Neighbours'', first in 1985, and then again in a different role in 2011.\n\nThe Albert Memorial hospital's suave superintendent, Doctor Brian Denham, was played by former male-model [[Michael Beecher (actor)|Michael Beecher]] for almost the entire run, leaving shortly before the series ended. Similarly, [[Alfred Sandor]] who played charming surgeon Doctor Raymond Shaw, was forced to leave due to ill health, and his last appearance was just a month before the final episode.\n\nStaying on until the very end was Doctor Denham's faithful secretary, original cast member Helen Gordon, played by [[Lynn James]]. Also there from the start was [[Tim Page (actor)|Tim Page]] who portrayed Dr. Grahame Steele, whom, along with Ada Simmonds, also appeared to the very end of the series, as did [[Judy McBurney]], as Nurse Tania Livingstone, who first appeared in episode 40. Notably, the serial also featured a very young [[Russell Crowe]] in his first acting role in an episode originally aired in 1977, playing 'Russell'.\n\n==Main cast==\n\n===Doctors===\n* Dr. Raymond Shaw \u2013 [[Alfred Sandor]] 1976-1982\n* Dr. Graham Steele \u2013 [[Tim Page (actor)|Tim Page]] 1976-1983 ''entire run''\n* Dr. Brian Denham \u2013 [[Michael Beecher (actor)|Michael Beecher]] 1976-1982\n* Dr. John Forrest \u2013 [[Alan Dale]] 1979-1983\n* Dr. Jim Howard \u2013 [[John Dommett]] 1976-1979\n* Dr. Greg Mason \u2013 [[Mark Holden]] 1976-1977\n* Dr. Craig Rothwell \u2013 [[John Walton (actor)|John Walton]] 1976-1978\n* Dr. Gail Henderson \u2013 [[Peta Toppano]] 1976-1977\n* Dr. Chris Piper \u2013 [[Bartholomew John]] 1977-1979\n* Dr. Mike Newman \u2013 [[Peter Bensley]] 1979-1983\n* Dr. Ben Fielding \u2013 [[Eric Oldfield]] 1978-1982\n* Dr. Peter Holland \u2013 [[Peter Lochran]] 1978-1982\n* Dr. Tony Garcia \u2013 [[Tony Alvarez (actor)|Tony Alvarez]] 1977-1979\n* Dr. Rod Langley \u2013 [[Chris Orchard]] 1978-1980\n* Dr. Liz Kennedy \u2013 [[Rebecca Gilling]] 1979-1982\n* Dr. Ian Parrish \u2013 [[Serge Lazareff]] 1979\n* Dr. Susan Richards \u2013 [[Judy Lynne]] 1977-1980\n* Dr. Robyn Porter \u2013 [[Joy Chambers]] 1980-81\n* Dr. Andrew Baxter \u2013 [[Andrew Sharp (actor)|Andrew Sharp]] 1979-1981\n* Dr. Dan Wheatley \u2013 [[John Hamblin]] 1979, 1981\n* Dr. Richard Quinlan \u2013 [[Vince Martin (actor)|Vince Martin]] 1981-2\n* Dr. Judith-Anne Napier \u2013 [[Carole Skinner]] 1980\n* Dr. Nick Barrett \u2013 [[Adrian Van Den Bok]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Russell Edwards \u2013 [[Peter Cousens]] 1980-1981\n* Dr. Lance Wilkinson \u2013 [[Michael Gow]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Matt Blake \u2013 [[Nick Holland]] 1982\n* Dr. Vincent Snape \u2013 [[Brian Moll]] 1977-1979\n* Dr. David Henderson \u2013 [[Graham Harvey (actor)|Graham Harvey]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Vicki Daniels \u2013 [[Sally Tayler]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Marion Stoddard -

It is a fast-paced arrangement with the accompanying visuals of the main cast cleverly edited with quick-cut synchronisation to the beat. With its distinctive horn section, thumping piano and dramatic drum snares, this theme is heavily influenced by the [[disco]] sound of the era.\n\nThe second version was introduced along with a brand new opening sequence focusing on the main cast performing an operation in the hospital theatre. A new, 5 note, dramatic build which gives way to a re-recording of the established signature tune. In 1980 an ambulance siren is heard at the start of the opening theme, replaced by a beeping heart monitor effect in 1982, which was used until the final episode in 1983.\n\nThere were four versions of the closing theme. The first was a distinctive disco arrangement, with the cast shown dancing to it in the first version of the opening titles, and although the end theme was in the same style, it was played at a much slower pace. During 1977, the closing sequence was shortened and a slightly faster arrangement of this closing theme was used. This was replaced by the probably most remembered and longest running closing theme which first aired in 1978 and was still being used to close the final few episodes in 1983. It is 1 minute in duration and is the only version of the theme that featured a dramatic piano and trumpet [[staccato]] intro. This theme is used on episodes where cast, all crew, and sponsors are all credited.\n\nThe third version is a 35-second, shorter arrangement of the second theme, however, it completely removes the intro and starts directly at the signature trumpet section, features a slightly different guitar solo, and has a much shorter, punchier ending. This theme was used when the credits contained only cast and sponsorship slides and not the crew.\n\nThe second and third theme tunes were more or less than used interchangeably for the rest of the series run, presumably depending on the running time of the episode, and the number of sponsorship slides being shown. These advertisements would be removed from international episodes thus reducing the run time of the closing credits considerably; this meant viewers of episodes edited outside Australia seldom, if ever, heard any of these theme tunes played out in full at the end of an episode, although the third, shorter version would air on very rare occasions.\n\nThe fourth version was used on the credits for the final episode only and was a suitably slow and sombre arrangement reflecting the end of the series. This slow version had previously been used as incidental music and the ending bars were often used as a \u201csting\u201d at commercial break points in the later episodes.\n\n==International success==\n\nThe relatively long-running serial also achieved modest international [[cult]] success, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it aired in a daytime slot on the commercial [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network for well over ten years starting in 1982 to 1995, as well as a short repeat run on [[Sky One]] from 1989 to 1992. The serial has not aired in the UK since 1995.\n\n==UK Broadcasts==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nIn the United Kingdom the programme was acquired by 13 of the 14 weekday members of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Network. [[Scottish Television]] never purchased the series, although [[Grampian Television]] and [[Border Television]] did. Most of the ITV regions initially screened ''The Young Doctors'' at their own regional pace starting in January 1982.\n*  [[ITV Central|Central Television]] pioneered the programme in a Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 slot from Tuesday, January 2, 1982, but it was quickly moved to Monday and Tuesdays at 15:45, sharing the slot with ''[[Take the High Road]]''. This was then increased to daily at 15:30 until ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]] '' began in February 1983. The two serials shared this timeslot for over four years, with ''The Young Doctors'' always airing on Mondays and Tuesdays. This continued until September 1987 when Central returned the programme to 12:00 noon, and then 12:35, and this allowed both ''The Young Doctors'' and ''Sons and Daughters'' to increase to four or five episodes a week in their respective slots. Following the end of ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' in early December 1988, ''The Young Doctors'' returned to 15:30 at the end of 1988, usually airing Tuesday to Friday until ''Families'' began in April 1990, which took the Monday and Tuesday 15:30 slot. ''The Young Doctors'' was finally moved to 14:50, Monday to Thursday in 1990, and finished 15 August 1992.\n* [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] started the series on Tuesday, 4 January 1983 and screened the series regularly on Mondays and Tuesdays, finishing on 18 April 1994.\n* [[Granada Television]] and [[Border Television]] both broadcast three episodes a week, and screened ''The Young Doctors'' Wednesday to Friday, finishing at Easter 1993 at 15:20.\n* [[Anglia Television]] started on 3 September 1984, going out Mondays and Tuesdays at 15:30 until 17 April 1990; then changed to Wednesdays and Thursdays from 25 April 1990. It was then moved to Thursdays and Fridays from Friday 6 July 1990 and an additional Wednesday episode returns in January 1991. Then Mondays to Fridays from January 1992 and finally, Thursdays and Fridays at 13:55 until Friday, 2 June 1995.\n* [[Thames Television]] and [[LWT]] in London started screening the series initially at 17:15 on Thursdays and Fridays from 23 June 1983 until 1 September 1984, before switching the series to 15:30 slot, to allow ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]'' the slot. From this point onwards, only Thames broadcast the series. When [[Carlton Television]] took over in January 1993, the series was dropped for 6 months to allow backlog of ''Blockbusters'' episodes to be aired, ''The Young Doctors'' returned daily on 7 June 1993 concluding the programme as an 80minute special from 13:55 on Friday 30 December 1994. \n* [[Grampian Television]] started on Monday, 14 November 1983, increased to 4 episode per week by 1991, and finished Friday, 30 September 1994.\n* Television South (TVS) started on Monday 9 April 1984 broadcasting Mondays and Tuesdays 15:30; In May switched; Mondays to Wednesdays 17:15 for summer 1984; then Thursdays and Fridays 15:30 from early September 1984; then Mondays to Wednesdays from January 1985 until Wednesday 2 September 1987; then Wednesdays and Thursdays at 12:00 noon; then Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays used from 4 January 1988 15.30; then Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from April 25, 1990. TVS lost their franchise at the end of 1992 but their successor, [[Meridian Television]] continued to show the series (more information on the timeslot required) and completed the run on 8 July 1993.\n* [[Tyne Tees Television]] began the series Monday, 1 October 1984 and aired Mondays and Tuesdays 15:30 until 17 April 1990. It was then moved to Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 14:00 from 25 April 1990. From Thursday, 3 January 1991 moves to 15:20 Thursdays and Fridays. A Wednesday episode was added from 23 January 1991, and then from January 1992, it is broadcast Mondays to Fridays at 15:20. From Monday 4 January 1993 Tyne Tees and Yorkshire screened the programme daily at 15:20. From January 1994 until the end in December of that year, this changed to Monday - Thursday at 14.50. \n* [[Television South West|TSW]] Started the series on 1 April 1985, Monday and Fridays at 17:15 until 8 July, when it was moved to 15.30 slot. On 17 October 1988, the series moves to 12:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays but due to network programming resulted in the series becoming weekly during 1989/1990, but returned to twice a week by the end 1990. [[Westcountry Television]] took over in 1993, and continued twice a week until early 1994 when it was increased to three times a week until 20 December 1995 when episode 1101 was broadcast. The series was not completed.\n* Years after most of the other regions [[Yorkshire Television]] started the series in October 1988, going out five times a week, reducing to three times a week from January 1989. In January 1993, they had to skip 215 episodes to enable them to catch up to [[Tyne Tees Television]], as from January 1993, both regions screened exactly the same material. It aired daily at 15:20, until January 1994 when the Friday episode was dropped until the series ended on Thursday 15 December 1994.\n* ''The Young Doctors'' was also aired on [[Sky1|Sky Channel]]. On Monday, 6 February 1989, the first episode was broadcast 17:00-17:30. From 6 July 1989, when the channel relaunched as [[Sky One]], ''The Young Doctors'' was moved to  15.15\u201315.45 (to make way for ''Sky Star Search'' which took the 17:00-18:00 slot), before finally settling in the  mid-morning 10:30-11:00 slot from 7 February 1990. When Sky purchased the newer Australian soap ''[[E Street]]'' in April 1992, they eventually cancelled ''The Young Doctors'' after episode 589 which aired in July 1992.\n\n==Remake==\nIn November 2007, the [[Nine Network]] announced plans to remake the series in conjunction with [[FremantleMedia]]. Originally, it was set to be broadcast in 2008 but due to script delays, the premiere date had been pushed back to 2009. The remake was set to be named ''Young Doctors'' (minus \"The\"). However, at the end of 2008, the [[Nine Network]] officially passed on the idea. The network decided against the remake, instead, confirming a second series of the popular Australian drama [[Underbelly (TV series)|Underbelly]]. [[FremantleMedia]] is currently searching for another television station to contract the programme.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22775803-5006009,00.html New life for Young Doctors | The Daily Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Home Media==\nSelected episodes of the serial were released on DVD in October 2006, under the title of The Best Romances. A second set of selected episodes, under the title of Classic Cliffhangers, was released in February 2008. In 1994, prior to the DVDs, a VHS was edited in the UK by \"NTV entertainment\" collecting episodes A, B (pilots) & 1.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Title\n! Format\n! Ep #\n! Discs/Tapes\n!

The series is set in the fictional Albert Memorial Hospital and is primarily concerned with romances between younger members of the hospital staff, rather than typical medical issues and procedures. The program was shown in numerous international locations, throughout the United Kingdom and North America, and also in France and Spain.\n\n==Series history==\n\nThe series was created and devised by [[Alan Coleman]] with [[Reg Watson]] acting as Executive Producer. Watson had been the Producer of the British soap opera ''[[Crossroads (British TV series)|Crossroads]]'' from 1964-1972 and he moved back to Australia to help set up a new drama department within the Reg Grundy Organisation, which at the time, was better known for its game shows. With Coleman directing, and Watson's experience of producing fast-turnaround, 5-days a week serial drama, ''The Young Doctors'' became the third [[soap opera]] produced by the [[Reg Grundy Organisation]] following ''[[Class of 74]] / 75'' for the Seven Network, and ''[[Until Tomorrow]]'', which also briefly aired on [[Seven Network]] in 1975.\n\n''The Young Doctors'' began in November 1976, a week earlier than another new soap opera on Nine, ''[[The Sullivans]]'', which was produced for the network by [[Crawford Productions]]. [[Nine Network]] made it clear only one of the series would be commissioned beyond the initial 13 week production run.\n\nAfter the 13-week trial period ''The Sullivans'', which had a budget which was three times bigger than ''The Young Doctors'', emerged as the critical success, so ''The Young Doctors'' was cancelled. Fans lobbied Nine Network, who then decided to reverse their decision and by popular demand ''The Young Doctors'' continued in its daily 6.00 pm slot and had a successful run of six and a half years, making it one of Australia's longest running and popular serials of the time. After several years however, many long-serving cast members began to leave, so during the final season in 1982\u201383, many new characters were added in an attempt to modernise and refresh the long-running serial.\n\nProducer and co-creator [[Alan Coleman]] also left in early 1982, and he was replaced by Sue Masters twelve months before the series finished production in late November 1982. Masters went on to produce Grundy's replacement medical soap, ''Starting Out'' for Nine, and then Grundy's stablemate ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' from 1983. Several cast members from ''The Young Doctors'' including [[Judy McBurney]], [[Genevieve Lemon]], [[Babs McMillan]], [[Tottie Goldsmith]] and [[Peter Bensley]] all went into leading roles in ''Prisoner'' after ''The Young Doctors'' finished production.\n\nThe advent of [[one-day cricket]] led to Nine Network moving the show around the schedules. The loss of several popular cast members also  contributed to a sharp decline in ratings, and as a consequence of this, the series was moved to a mid-afternoon timeslot and then cancelled in late 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theyoungdoctors.com/show/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807123809/http://www.theyoungdoctors.com/show/history.htm |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen the series ended after 1396 episodes, it held the record of Australia's longest-running commercial television drama serial, which was previously held by ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]''. This was later surpassed by ''[[A Country Practice]]'' and then ''[[Neighbours]]'', which is currently the longest-running Australian drama serial. ''The Young Doctors'' also holds the distinction, rare among long-running Australian dramas, of having never won any sort of television award.\n\n''The Young Doctors'' final episode aired on Nine Network on March 30, 1983 at 14:30, and, coincidentally, ''The Sullivans'' had also ended just two weeks earlier.\n\nNine Network and Grundy's launched several new soap operas in an attempt to fill the gaps left in their early-evening schedule. First, in July 1982, there was an attempt to emulate the opulence and grandeur of American prime-time soaps such as ''Dallas'' and ''Dynasty'' and Reg Watson came up with ''[[Taurus Rising]]'' which had a short, but eventful 21-episode run. Grundy's reportedly spent over $1 million on the opening episodes alone and the series was also notably recorded entirely on film rather than the standard videotape presentation. This notorious series went on to become popular when broadcast internationally, particularly in 1984 when it aired in syndication on some US TV networks.\n\nNext, in February 1983, Grundy's and Nine launched'' [[Waterloo Station (TV series)|Waterloo Station]]'', a series focused on two sisters, both married to policemen, and their adult children starting careers in the police force. After a month of poor ratings, and just 40 episodes, Nine pulled it from the schedules and quickly  launched ''[[Starting Out]]'', which was set around a group of young medical students at a boarding house. However, this series also quickly flopped and was discontinued after only 85 episodes had been produced.\n\nFinally, in 1985, came ''[[Possession (TV series)|Possession]]'' which started promisingly with an intriguing espionage story before giving way to the usual soap-opera [[Trope (cinema)|tropes]]. Although it lasted long enough to give the producers a chance to revamp the storylines and characters to try and save the series, when Nine moved it out of primetime, it became clear that ''Possession'' was never going to be a success. Cutting their losses, the series was pulled after just 6 months and Grundy's and Nine Network did not attempt to launch another soap opera again, with ''The Young Doctors'' remaining Grundy's sole soap opera success on the network.\n\n==Story and setting==\nDespite the medical setting, medical procedures rarely featured in storylines, with most of the stories and plots focusing more on the personal life, romances and dramas of the staff. All scenes were played out in the various sets forming the Albert Memorial Hospital. A memorial plaque situated on the wall of the studio set of the hospital's exterior stated the hospital opened in 1889 and it is also established early in the series that the Albert Memorial is located in a [[Sydney]] district, with Sydney generically referred to as 'the City'.\n\nThe most regularly seen set was the large hospital entrance lobby containing a reception desk, refreshments kiosk, a lift and stairs to the upper floors, and swinging double-doors that led into the casualty department. Various wards, offices, theatres and small medicine labs all saw an equal amount of romantic and dramatic action over the years. Alan Coleman revealed on a DVD release of the series that the various 'flats' used as sets were simply re-dressed with different hospital equipment and furniture giving the Albert Memorial a sense of monotony often associated with clinical, hospital environments.\n\nLater in ''The Young Doctors'' run, location shooting became  more frequent and viewers saw more of the hospital's exterior and grounds. Scenes filmed outside the hospital now showed modern,  1960's era buildings, presumably extensions to the original Victorian hospital. Exterior shots were filmed at the real life [[Royal North Shore Hospital]] and the former Greenwich Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, which was used for later exterior shots. There was also a Chapel located in the hospital grounds which was filmed on a few occasions, most notably when Julie Holland ([[Lisa Aldenhoven]]) was shot at the [[altar]] on her Wedding day to dashing Doctor Russell Edwards ([[Peter Cousens]]). With location shooting so rare, a trip to Melbourne for a travelogue-style Wedding and tour of the city was an extravagant way to celebrate Liz Kennedy's marriage to Doctor John Forrest in 1981.\n\nThere was also a local bar ''Bunny's'' which was another venue for the staff to mingle. The bar was originally owned by, and named after, Bunny Howard, played by [[Ugly Dave Grey]] who was killed off after the first 65 episodes. ''Bunny's'' was said to be situated on the opposite side of the busy main road to the hospital. Although the bar's exterior was never shown on-screen, its interior regularly featured in every episode for the duration of the 6 and a half year series, appearing in both the first and final episodes.\n\n==Cast and Characters==\n''The Young Doctors'' had a relatively high turnover of young cast playing the doctors and nurses whom featured alongside a more stable roster of longer-running elder cast members. The serial also featured many of today's most well-known Australian actors appearing in their earliest roles. Actress [[Peta Toppano]], who appeared in the first season of ''Prisoner'' in 1979, and later, ''Return to Eden'' in 1986, had previously appeared in ''The Young Doctors'' for just over a year as Doctor Gail Henderson from the first episodes to 1977. Appearing alongside her was future singer, songwriter, and music producer [[Mark Holden]] who played pin-up Doctor Greg Mason for 12 months before his music career took off. At the same time, a lengthy story arc featured [[Mark Hembrow]] in an extended guest role as the (fictional) hugely popular rock singer Georgie Saint. This storyline included the famous 70's pin-up icon [[Abigail (actress)|Abigail]] who completed two stints in the series as assertive secretary, and later Georgie's manager, Hilary Templeton. She would go on to play tragic-heroine Caroline Morrell in ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' the following decade.\n\nParticularly popular during the early years was [[Cornelia Frances]] who played sternly efficient Sister Grace Scott, later Matron. The character was regularly seen irate and disciplining the young nurses in her charge. She was also central to one of ''The Young Doctors'' most famous cliffhangers when Sister Scott accidentally plummeted down an empty lift shaft and broke her leg. Frances would go on to play the equally formidable character Barbara Hamilton in ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' from 1982 to 1986, and then the truly terrifying Judge [[Morag Bellingham]] in numerous stints in ''Home and Away'' from 1988.\n\nAnother star cast member was [[Gwen Plumb]], a recipient of the [[British Empire Medal]] and [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] recipient for her service to the arts and communities service, who portrayed gossipy kiosk lady Ada Simmonds for the length of the series, appearing from episode 2. Ada was very close Dennis Jamison, the hyperactive hospital orderly, played for six years by [[Chris King (actor)|Chris King]] who became a big hit with viewers. Actress [[Joanne Samuel]] was another fan-favourite as Nurse Jill Gordon. The actress was written out of ''The Young Doctors'' by Alan Coleman to allow Samuel the golden opportunity to star in the film ''[[Mad Max]]'' alongside [[Mel Gibson]] in 1979. The film is now widely considered an enduring example of classic Australian cinema.\n\n[[Rebecca Gilling]], who later became an international star due to her iconic role as Stephanie Harper in the hugely successful series ''[[Return to Eden]]'', spent three years in ''The Young Doctors'' as Liz Kennedy. Her character memorably progressed from a first year Nurse to a fully qualified Psychologist before being fatally electrocuted by a faulty lamp on her Wedding night to Doctor John Forrest, an early role for [[Alan Dale]], who later became a star of ''Neighbours'' for eight years as [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]], before going on to appear in many successful U.S drama series and films. Also, ''Neighbours'' current longest running actress, [[Jackie Woodburne]], who has played enduring and wise [[Susan Kennedy]] for over 25 years, was tragic young Nurse Maggie Gordon in ''The Young Doctors'' during 1980\u201381.\n\nAnimal rights activist [[Lynda Stoner]], and [[Paula Duncan]], both left their respective roles in ''The Young Doctors'' to join Crawford's soap ''[[Cop Shop]]''. Duncan would star in this series for its entire run from 1977 to 1984 as Detective Danni Frances. She then joined Network Ten's ''Prisoner'' for its final season in 1986 as regular character Lorelei Wilkinson. After this, it was a starring role in Grundy's replacement soap for ''Prisoner'' on Network Ten, ''[[Richmond Hill (TV series)|Richmond Hill]]'', in 1988 (which also starred Gwen Plumb from ''The Young Doctors'') as Janet Bryant, but this series only lasted one year. A prolific soap star, she then had more guest stints in soaps including ''[[Home and Away]]'' in 1989, ''[[Paradise Beach]]'' in 1993, ''[[Breakers (TV series)|Breakers]]'' in 1997, and also ''Neighbours'', first in 1985, and then again in a different role in 2011.\n\nThe Albert Memorial hospital's suave superintendent, Doctor Brian Denham, was played by former male-model [[Michael Beecher (actor)|Michael Beecher]] for almost the entire run, leaving shortly before the series ended. Similarly, [[Alfred Sandor]] who played charming surgeon Doctor Raymond Shaw, was forced to leave due to ill health, and his last appearance was just a month before the final episode.\n\nStaying on until the very end was Doctor Denham's faithful secretary, original cast member Helen Gordon, played by [[Lynn James]]. Also there from the start was [[Tim Page (actor)|Tim Page]] who portrayed Dr. Grahame Steele, whom, along with Ada Simmonds, also appeared to the very end of the series, as did [[Judy McBurney]], as Nurse Tania Livingstone, who first appeared in episode 40. Notably, the serial also featured a very young [[Russell Crowe]] in his first acting role in an episode originally aired in 1977, playing 'Russell'.\n\n==Main cast==\n\n===Doctors===\n* Dr. Raymond Shaw \u2013 [[Alfred Sandor]] 1976-1982\n* Dr. Graham Steele \u2013 [[Tim Page (actor)|Tim Page]] 1976-1983 ''entire run''\n* Dr. Brian Denham \u2013 [[Michael Beecher (actor)|Michael Beecher]] 1976-1982\n* Dr. John Forrest \u2013 [[Alan Dale]] 1979-1983\n* Dr. Jim Howard \u2013 [[John Dommett]] 1976-1979\n* Dr. Greg Mason \u2013 [[Mark Holden]] 1976-1977\n* Dr. Craig Rothwell \u2013 [[John Walton (actor)|John Walton]] 1976-1978\n* Dr. Gail Henderson \u2013 [[Peta Toppano]] 1976-1977\n* Dr. Chris Piper \u2013 [[Bartholomew John]] 1977-1979\n* Dr. Mike Newman \u2013 [[Peter Bensley]] 1979-1983\n* Dr. Ben Fielding \u2013 [[Eric Oldfield]] 1978-1982\n* Dr. Peter Holland \u2013 [[Peter Lochran]] 1978-1982\n* Dr. Tony Garcia \u2013 [[Tony Alvarez (actor)|Tony Alvarez]] 1977-1979\n* Dr. Rod Langley \u2013 [[Chris Orchard]] 1978-1980\n* Dr. Liz Kennedy \u2013 [[Rebecca Gilling]] 1979-1982\n* Dr. Ian Parrish \u2013 [[Serge Lazareff]] 1979\n* Dr. Susan Richards \u2013 [[Judy Lynne]] 1977-1980\n* Dr. Robyn Porter \u2013 [[Joy Chambers]] 1980-81\n* Dr. Andrew Baxter \u2013 [[Andrew Sharp (actor)|Andrew Sharp]] 1979-1981\n* Dr. Dan Wheatley \u2013 [[John Hamblin]] 1979, 1981\n* Dr. Richard Quinlan \u2013 [[Vince Martin (actor)|Vince Martin]] 1981-2\n* Dr. Judith-Anne Napier \u2013 [[Carole Skinner]] 1980\n* Dr. Nick Barrett \u2013 [[Adrian Van Den Bok]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Russell Edwards \u2013 [[Peter Cousens]] 1980-1981\n* Dr. Lance Wilkinson \u2013 [[Michael Gow]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Matt Blake \u2013 [[Nick Holland]] 1982\n* Dr. Vincent Snape \u2013 [[Brian Moll]] 1977-1979\n* Dr. David Henderson \u2013 [[Graham Harvey (actor)|Graham Harvey]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Vicki Daniels \u2013 [[Sally Tayler]] 1982-1983\n* Dr. Marion Stoddard -

It is a fast-paced arrangement with the accompanying visuals of the main cast cleverly edited with quick-cut synchronisation to the beat. With its distinctive horn section, thumping piano and dramatic drum snares, this theme is heavily influenced by the [[disco]] sound of the era.\n\nThe second version was introduced along with a brand new opening sequence focusing on the main cast performing an operation in the hospital theatre. A new, 5 note, dramatic build which gives way to a re-recording of the established signature tune. In 1980 an ambulance siren is heard at the start of the opening theme, replaced by a beeping heart monitor effect in 1982, which was used until the final episode in 1983.\n\nThere were four versions of the closing theme. The first was a distinctive disco arrangement, with the cast shown dancing to it in the first version of the opening titles, and although the end theme was in the same style, it was played at a much slower pace. During 1977, the closing sequence was shortened and a slightly faster arrangement of this closing theme was used. This was replaced by the probably most remembered and longest running closing theme which first aired in 1978 and was still being used to close the final few episodes in 1983. It is 1 minute in duration and is the only version of the theme that featured a dramatic piano and trumpet [[staccato]] intro. This theme is used on episodes where cast, all crew, and sponsors are all credited.\n\nThe third version is a 35-second, shorter arrangement of the second theme, however, it completely removes the intro and starts directly at the signature trumpet section, features a slightly different guitar solo, and has a much shorter, punchier ending. This theme was used when the credits contained only cast and sponsorship slides and not the crew.\n\nThe second and third theme tunes were more or less than used interchangeably for the rest of the series run, presumably depending on the running time of the episode, and the number of sponsorship slides being shown. These advertisements would be removed from international episodes thus reducing the run time of the closing credits considerably; this meant viewers of episodes edited outside Australia seldom, if ever, heard any of these theme tunes played out in full at the end of an episode, although the third, shorter version would air on very rare occasions.\n\nThe fourth version was used on the credits for the final episode only and was a suitably slow and sombre arrangement reflecting the end of the series. This slow version had previously been used as incidental music and the ending bars were often used as a \u201csting\u201d at commercial break points in the later episodes.\n\n==International success==\n\nThe relatively long-running serial also achieved modest international [[cult]] success, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it aired in a daytime slot on the commercial [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network for well over ten years starting in 1982 to 1995, as well as a short repeat run on [[Sky One]] from 1989 to 1992. The serial has not aired in the UK since 1995.\n\n==UK Broadcasts==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nIn the United Kingdom the programme was acquired by 13 of the 14 weekday members of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Network. [[Scottish Television]] never purchased the series, although [[Grampian Television]] and [[Border Television]] did. Most of the ITV regions initially screened ''The Young Doctors'' at their own regional pace starting in January 1982.\n*  [[ITV Central|Central Television]] pioneered the programme in a Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 slot from Tuesday, January 2, 1982, but it was quickly moved to Monday and Tuesdays at 15:45, sharing the slot with ''[[Take the High Road]]''. This was then increased to daily at 15:30 until ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]] '' began in February 1983. The two serials shared this timeslot for over four years, with ''The Young Doctors'' always airing on Mondays and Tuesdays. This continued until September 1987 when Central returned the programme to 12:00 noon, and then 12:35, and this allowed both ''The Young Doctors'' and ''Sons and Daughters'' to increase to four or five episodes a week in their respective slots. Following the end of ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' in early December 1988, ''The Young Doctors'' returned to 15:30 at the end of 1988, usually airing Tuesday to Friday until ''Families'' began in April 1990, which took the Monday and Tuesday 15:30 slot. ''The Young Doctors'' was finally moved to 14:50, Monday to Thursday in 1990, and finished 15 August 1992.\n* [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] started the series on Tuesday, 4 January 1983 and screened the series regularly on Mondays and Tuesdays, finishing on 18 April 1994.\n* [[Granada Television]] and [[Border Television]] both broadcast three episodes a week, and screened ''The Young Doctors'' Wednesday to Friday, finishing at Easter 1993 at 15:20.\n* [[Anglia Television]] started on 3 September 1984, going out Mondays and Tuesdays at 15:30 until 17 April 1990; then changed to Wednesdays and Thursdays from 25 April 1990. It was then moved to Thursdays and Fridays from Friday 6 July 1990 and an additional Wednesday episode returns in January 1991. Then Mondays to Fridays from January 1992 and finally, Thursdays and Fridays at 13:55 until Friday, 2 June 1995.\n* [[Thames Television]] and [[LWT]] in London started screening the series initially at 17:15 on Thursdays and Fridays from 23 June 1983 until 1 September 1984, before switching the series to 15:30 slot, to allow ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]'' the slot. From this point onwards, only Thames broadcast the series. When [[Carlton Television]] took over in January 1993, the series was dropped for 6 months to allow backlog of ''Blockbusters'' episodes to be aired, ''The Young Doctors'' returned daily on 7 June 1993 concluding the programme as an 80minute special from 13:55 on Friday 30 December 1994. \n* [[Grampian Television]] started on Monday, 14 November 1983, increased to 4 episode per week by 1991, and finished Friday, 30 September 1994.\n* Television South (TVS) started on Monday 9 April 1984 broadcasting Mondays and Tuesdays 15:30; In May switched; Mondays to Wednesdays 17:15 for summer 1984; then Thursdays and Fridays 15:30 from early September 1984; then Mondays to Wednesdays from January 1985 until Wednesday 2 September 1987; then Wednesdays and Thursdays at 12:00 noon; then Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays used from 4 January 1988 15.30; then Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from April 25, 1990. TVS lost their franchise at the end of 1992 but their successor, [[Meridian Television]] continued to show the series (more information on the timeslot required) and completed the run on 8 July 1993.\n* [[Tyne Tees Television]] began the series Monday, 1 October 1984 and aired Mondays and Tuesdays 15:30 until 17 April 1990. It was then moved to Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 14:00 from 25 April 1990. From Thursday, 3 January 1991 moves to 15:20 Thursdays and Fridays. A Wednesday episode was added from 23 January 1991, and then from January 1992, it is broadcast Mondays to Fridays at 15:20. From Monday 4 January 1993 Tyne Tees and Yorkshire screened the programme daily at 15:20. From January 1994 until the end in December of that year, this changed to Monday - Thursday at 14.50. \n* [[Television South West|TSW]] Started the series on 1 April 1985, Monday and Fridays at 17:15 until 8 July, when it was moved to 15.30 slot. On 17 October 1988, the series moves to 12:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays but due to network programming resulted in the series becoming weekly during 1989/1990, but returned to twice a week by the end 1990. [[Westcountry Television]] took over in 1993, and continued twice a week until early 1994 when it was increased to three times a week until 20 December 1995 when episode 1101 was broadcast. The series was not completed.\n* Years after most of the other regions [[Yorkshire Television]] started the series in October 1988, going out five times a week, reducing to three times a week from January 1989. In January 1993, they had to skip 215 episodes to enable them to catch up to [[Tyne Tees Television]], as from January 1993, both regions screened exactly the same material. It aired daily at 15:20, until January 1994 when the Friday episode was dropped until the series ended on Thursday 15 December 1994.\n* ''The Young Doctors'' was also aired on [[Sky1|Sky Channel]]. On Monday, 6 February 1989, the first episode was broadcast 17:00-17:30. From 6 July 1989, when the channel relaunched as [[Sky One]], ''The Young Doctors'' was moved to  15.15\u201315.45 (to make way for ''Sky Star Search'' which took the 17:00-18:00 slot), before finally settling in the  mid-morning 10:30-11:00 slot from 7 February 1990. When Sky purchased the newer Australian soap ''[[E Street]]'' in April 1992, they eventually cancelled ''The Young Doctors'' after episode 589 which aired in July 1992.\n\n==Remake==\nIn November 2007, the [[Nine Network]] announced plans to remake the series in conjunction with [[FremantleMedia]]. Originally, it was set to be broadcast in 2008 but due to script delays, the premiere date had been pushed back to 2009. The remake was set to be named ''Young Doctors'' (minus \"The\"). However, at the end of 2008, the [[Nine Network]] officially passed on the idea. The network decided against the remake, instead, confirming a second series of the popular Australian drama [[Underbelly (TV series)|Underbelly]]. [[FremantleMedia]] is currently searching for another television station to contract the programme.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22775803-5006009,00.html New life for Young Doctors | The Daily Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Home Media==\nSelected episodes of the serial were released on DVD in October 2006, under the title of The Best Romances.

Park and fellow Hawaii Five-0 co-star [[Daniel Dae Kim]] left the show in 2017, leaving the cast without any Asian regulars, after a salary dispute where it was reported that CBS's latest offer paid them 10-15% less than their white co-stars, [[Alex O'Loughlin]] and [[Scott Caan]]. CBS claimed that they had given \"unprecedented\" salary raises to Park and Kim, suggesting that they had been paid a lot less under their old contracts. Some critics noted that the network's \"refusal to pay Kim and Park on matching terms with O'Loughlin and Caan was CBS's formal declaration that they were determined to protect a disparity that has been a sore point since the show's premiere: The assertion was that O'Loughlin and Caan are \"Hawaii Five-0\" \"stars\" with Kim and Park being merely \"co-leads\" or supporting cast\", yet Kim and Park were originally featured heavily on advertising and proved to be a crucial part of the show's success.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Hawaii-Five-O-Stars-Bold-Stand-432721473.html|title='Hawaii Five-O' Stars' Bold Stand|work=NBC Chicago|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/columns/hawaii-five-0-daniel-dae-kim-grace-park-cbs-parity-1202488093|title=CBS Made Wrong Call on Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park 'Hawaii Five-0' Deals (Column)|first=Sonia|last=Saraiya|date=July 6, 2017|website=Variety.com|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/opinions/hawaii-five-0-asian-american-actors-opinion-yang/index.html|title='Hawaii Five-0' Asian actors won't be without projects for long|first=Jeff|last=Yang|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"salon.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/07/06/hawaii-five-0-cast-daniel-dae-kim-grace-park-cbs-diversity|title=Crunching CBS' diversity numbers after the \"Hawaii Five-0\" cast departures is painful|date=July 6, 2017|website=Salon.com|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2004, Park married real estate developer Phil Kim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreasociety.org/portraits/grace_park_profile.html |title=Grace Park Profile |publisher=koreasociety.org |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> The two live in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listal.com/grace-park |title=Grace Park |publisher=Listal.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref> They have one son, born in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvovermind.com/entertainment-news/five-things-didnt-know-grace-park|title=Five Things You Didn't Know about Grace Park|date=July 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.promipool.com/celebrities/hawaii-five-0-meet-grace-park-s-husband|title='Hawaii Five-0': Meet Grace Park's Husband|date=2019-10-19|website=Promipool.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Park is also a former member of [[NXIVM]], an alleged sex cult, and has appeared in video interviews with NXIVM founder [[Keith Raniere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artvoice.com/2018/04/15/9-videos-surface-show-hawaii-five-0-actress-grace-park-deeply-drunk-kool-aid-sex-slaver-cult-leader-keith-raniere/|title=9-videos surface that show Hawaii Five-0 Actress Grace Park deeply drunk the Kool-aid of sex-slaver cult leader Keith Raniere|last=Artvoice|date=April 15, 2018|website=Artvoice}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvweb.com/sex-cult-nxivm-members-nicki-clyne-kristin-kreuk-grace-park/|title=Smallville, Battlestar Galactica Actresses Tied to Alleged Sex Cult|date=April 7, 2018|website=TVweb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Actress-Allison-Mack-charged-in-NXIVM-sex-12851691.php|title=Women branded with actress' initials in secret sex-slave club|first=Brendan J.|last=Lyons|date=April 20, 2018|website=Times Union}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nPark was ranked 58th in [[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] Online's 2011 ''Hot 100 List,'' 60th in the \"Maxim\" Online's 2010 \"Hot 100 List\", 93rd in the \"Maxim\" Online's 2006 \"Hot 100 List\", and 81st on the ''Maxim'' magazine ''Hot 100 of 2005'' list.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He has made a significant contribution towards imparting an exclusive Sri Lankan identity to the Sinhalese music. He was a musician, artist, poet and a photographer blended in to one. He also devoted more than 20 years of his life to uplifting musical standards in radio broadcasting.\n\n== Early life ==\nDunstan was born the eldest of nine children to businessman Abraham de Silva and Jane Kurukulasekara. In his childhood, he had cultivated a habit of visiting the [[Weligama]] beach and playing a flute he had crafted himself, to the melodies he heard over the gramophone at home. His father was not happy with this practice but his mother was more sympathetic.\n\nHe started his primary education at Sidhdhartha College [[Weligama]] in 1930 and moved to [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College Colombo]], a leading school in Sri Lanka for his secondary education in 1936. Dunstan successfully completed his Senior School Certificate in the English Medium from [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]] offering English Language and Literature, Latin, Mathematics, Physics and Visual Arts. During this time he wrote poems to the school magazine and also contributed his visual arts to the school magazine. During this period he also learnt to play the violin from the renowned musician Don Vincent Peiris.\n\nAfter completing early studies at Nalanda College, Dunstan moved to [[Ananda College]] Colombo, another leading school in Sri Lanka and successfully completed the London matriculation examination in 1939.\n\nHis mother wanted her elder son Dunstan to be an Engineer. In order to fulfil his mother's aspirations Dunstan entered the [[Maradana College of Technology|Ceylon Technical College]] to pursue Engineering studies. Though he had chosen engineering studies to make his mother happy, his interest and passion was in music and arts. After successfully completing the Intermediate examination at the Ceylon Technical College, Dunstan quit engineering to pursue a career in music and arts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    \n== Tertiary Education ==\nIn 1945, Dunstan received a government scholarship to study music at the prestigious [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], in Lucknow, India. Distinguished scholar, Professor [[S N Ratanjankar]] was one of his teachers at the Bhatkhande Music Institute.\n\nDuring his term there, Dunstan participated in many music concerts produced by Bhatkhande Music Institute. He sang a Sinhalese song with his ''contemporary, a Bengali Student Bokul Dhaar in'' ''Malathi Maadhawa ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dd3 \u0db8\u0dcf\u0db0\u0dc0 ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bc0 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb5 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935'' )  concert produced by  Kalyan Pakar''. As'' published in the [[Lankadeepa|Lankaadeepa]] newspaper 1952 March 17 this was supposedly the first ever Sinhalese song sung in a concert in India. At this concert Dunstan and Bokul sang the song P''udamu meakusum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:''\u00a0''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7 \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi|Hindi:]] \u092a\u0941\u0926\u092e\u0941 \u092e\u0915\u0941\u0938\u0941\u092e'' ) composed by [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakoo]]<nowiki/>n.\n\nDunstan was one of the five best students selected by the Bhatkhande Music Institute to sing the [[Indian National Anthem]] at the first independence celebrations in India on the 15 August 1947. After successfully completing seven years of music studies Dunstan returned to Sri Lanka with a Sangeet Visharad degree. Since then he was known publicly as Visharad P Dunstan de Silva. He was the third Sri Lankan to obtain the music Visharad degree with the legendary musicians [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and [[Sunil Shantha]] being the first two.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Teacher ===\nAfter giving up engineering studies, Dunstan joined his Alma mater\u00a0 Nalanda College as the resident Arts Teacher. The famous songwriter [[Karunaratne Abeysekera]] and [[Ridgeway Thilakeratne]] a one-time Director General of Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation were two of his students at [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]].\n\n=== Photographer ===\nAfter completing his music studies in India he returned to Sri Lanka in 1951 and pursued his third passion, Photography. Dunstan opened a Colour Photo Studio under the name Studio Colour at No 453 [[Union Place]], Colombo 2 which was supposedly the first colour studio in Sri Lanka. Within two years he opened up another branch of Studio Colour at No 259/1, Colombo 4.\n\nPrime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R Premadasa]] was a good friend of Dunstan. Because of this trust as a good friend and in recognition of his photography skills the Prime Minister Premadasa bestowed an honorary position on Dunstan as his personal photographer when he was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. This was a prestigious position where Dunstan had to work in a high security environment having access to personal events in the Prime Minister's life.\n\nWhile being engaged in music, he continued simultaneously with his photography too. In 1978 he produced all colour photos for a 213-page publication titled, An Album of Buddhist Paintings published by the National Archives compiled by Professor [[Siri Gunasinghe]]. Dunstan provided photos of 40 Temple Wall Paintings for this publication covering the ancient sites of Gadaladeniya, Maulgampola, Hanguranketha, Degaldoru, Madawala, Kotagala and [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla Rock Temple]].\n\n=== Musician ===\nDustan grew up listening to gramophone music at home. His passion for music was conceived and evolved over the gramophone music he was exposed to at home as a child that took him through a music career placing him finally as the Head of Sinhalese Music Division at the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).\n\nWhile engaging in his engineering studies at the Technical College, he followed two other passions that dearly touched his heart - Photography and Music. During this time an opportunity to play the flute for music programs in the [[Radio Ceylon]] came his way. He played the flute for the music programs of accomplished musicians [[Ananda Samarakoon]], Surya Shankar Molligoda and Anangalal Athukorala. The enticing lead accompaniment on the flute in Ananda Samarakoon's popular song of that vintage \"Punchi Suda Sudukatiya\" ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0dd4\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe; [[Hindi]]:\u092a\u0902\u091a \u0938\u0941\u0926\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e) is credited to de Silva.\n\nWhile being engaged in the photography business Dunstan continued to work on his prime passion of Music, which he studied at the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music Institute]]. In 1952 he composed music for the Opera Pushpa Shrungara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dca\u0db4 \u0dc1\u0dd8\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baa \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb1 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093e'' ) directed by [[Shesha Palihakkara]] dancer, film actor, and producer. Dunstan made his debut as a music composer for Pushpa Shrungara.\n\nDuring a period of 21 years from 1954 to 1975 as the Head of Sinhalese Music at [[Radio Ceylon]] and [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] Dunstan produced many popular programs such as\n\n*''Rasadhara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] :\u0dbb\u0dc3\u0db0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bbe ; [[Hindi]]:\u0930\u0938 \u0927\u0930\u093e )''\n*''Guwanviduli Geetha Nataka ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad \u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7\u0d9a; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0b95 ; [[Hindi]]: \u0917\u0941\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915  )''\n*''Vijaya Geetha ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4; [[Hindi]]: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e )''\n*''Raaga Rasa Vindhana ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db1; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95 \u00a0 \u0bb0\u0b9a \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9;  [[Hindi]]: \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0930\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e )''\n*''Sath Piyum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u00a0 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0920 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0941\u092e )''\n\nIn addition to being the producer he also composed music for these.\n\n=== Artist ===\nDespite spending his professional life mostly in music, he continued to engage in art which he practised since the time that he was the art teacher at Nalanda College. Dunstan designed the cover page of the significant publication called Sangeetha Sanhithaa<ref>{{Cite book|last=Abayasundara|first=Wimal|title=Sangeetha Sanhitha|publisher=S Godage Saha Sahodarayo|year=|isbn=9552055008|location=|pages=}}</ref> written by Eminent Sinhala poet and lyricist and Kalakeerthi Pundit Wimal Abeysundara.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Abeysundara|first=Wimal|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/06/13/news19.html|title=Wimal Abeysundara no more|date=|work=The Island|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Poet ===\n[[File:Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon.jpg|thumb|Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon Orchestra]]\nDunstan continued to write poems another-pastime that he had developed during his school years. He was a regular poet featured in leading English newspapers of Sri Lanka. There remain more than 50 unpublished poems written by Dunstan to date. One of those is \"The Flute\", which was the most sacred music instrument to him which he excelled in since early childhood. He used the flute to create his music compositions.\n\n\"The Flute\" is a beautiful poem Dunstan wrote about his beloved flute instrument which accompanied him from early life to the end of the life. He learnt music over the flute, his first job as a musician was to play the flute in [[Radio Ceylon]] orchestra and later he composed music using a flute.\n\n=== Visiting lecturer ===\n[[Lionel Edirisinghe]] Founder Principal of the Government Music College which later matured into the [[University of the Visual and Performing Arts]], offered a visiting lecturer position to Dunstan.\n\nWhen Dunstan became busy with his work at the Radio Ceylon producing music programs and working as a visiting lecture he didn't have enough time to spend on his photography business.\n\nThese dual engagements with the Radio Ceylon and the University competing for most of his time the simultaneous management of his photography business became untenable.\u00a0Consequently, he handed over his successful Studio Colour business to his brother Rohitha to continue.\n\n== Compositions ==\nFew of his compositions are;\n\n*Obata mathaka naa\u00a0 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd1\n*Sudu piruwata andalaa \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf\n*Wanamal piyali salaa \u0dc0\u0db1\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dcf\n*Prakgna Pradeepa Dalwaa \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da5\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4 \u0daf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf\n*Oba dakumen yali jeewath wannata \u0d94\u0db6 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7\n*Pipunu malea ruwa \u0db4\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc5\u0dda \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\n*\"Kahawan goyamata\" \u0d9a\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dba\u0db8\u0da7\n\n== Mentor ==\nDunstan was a mentor to many upcoming singers at his time in the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]]. When [[Sanath Nandasiri|Sanath Nanadasiri]] a stalwart of Sri Lankan music in later years returned to the country in 1965, conferred with a Visharad degree from the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhatkande Music Institute]], Dunstan extended him an opportunity to participate with a debut rendition as a new artist for the Navadali Hena radio musical. Dunstan called upon Somathilaka Jayamaha another musician who reached the top rungs later who worked as an admin officer in [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to the free music classes he conducted at YMBA Colombo. When Somathilaka finished the course Dunstan recruited him to the choir in his programs. Over time Somathilaka was promoted as an A-Grade singer and reached the upper echelons as an accomplished singer. Devananda Waidyasekara was also another talent Dunstan picked and groomed at [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to turn into an accomplished singer.\n\n== Two Milestones ==\nThe year 1954 marked two important milestones in his life. One was in his personal life and the other was in his professional life. On 24 February 1954 he married Hilda Fonseka from [[Wadduwa]]. Dunstan had met Hilda when she came to see her music teacher during the time she was a student at Sri Sumangala Girls School, Panadura. Gunaseana de Silva who studied at [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music institute]] with Dunstan proposed Hilda to Dunstan.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, Dunstan and Hilda were blessed with a precious daughter Ayanthi Manjula.\n\nIn the same year Dunstan got married, he received an invitation from the then Director General of the Radio Ceylon, [[M. J. Perera|M J Perera]], to join the Radio Ceylon. In 1954 Dunstan joined the Radio Ceylon as the Head of Sinhalese Music Programs.\n\nOn the 5th January 1967 Radio Ceylon was instituted as a public corporation as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He continued to serve as the head of Sinhalese Music Programs with the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n== Service to Sinhalese Music ==\nDuring his 21 years of service in the national broadcasting corporation, he dedicated his time to uplifting musical standards and developing Sinhalese music to evolve towards a Sri Lankan identity, moving away from the dependence on foreign tunes. His good friend Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva|W D Amaradeva]] contributed immensely to this endeavour with his own research efforts in this arena. \u00a0\n\nDunstan organised many classical music concerts inviting reputed singers and musicians from India affording Sri Lankan music lovers a chance to listen to them. He brought over his good friend legendary sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] five times to Sri Lanka. [[Lakshmi Shankar]], Ustad [[Alla Rakha|Allarakha]] Qureshi, [[V. G. Jog|Vishnu Govind Jog]], Pandit Dinkar Kaikini <ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaikini|first=Dinkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-events/A-tribute-to-Pandit-Dinkar-Kaikini/articleshow/7309862.cms|title=ETIMES|date=18 April 2020|work=Entertainment Times|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and Dipali Nag were other accomplished musicians he brought from India. \n[[File:Dunstan--Edit.jpg|thumb|L to R- Dunstan, his daughter and wife, Ravi Shankar, Laxmie Shankar and Ustad Allarakha Qureshi]]\nNone of those concerts were for commercial benefit. He organised those only to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan music lovers to listen to the music of those legends. There were times that he had to pocket out shortfalls in organising these concerts.\n\nDunstan was the founding secretary of the music subcommittee of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka which was a branch of the then [[Ministry of Higher Education and Highways|Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs]]. In 1959 he was appointed the President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1964 he represented Sri Lanka in the International Classical Music conference in Germany. \n[[File:Dunstan 4 lihgtroom.jpg|center|thumb|Dunstan representing Sri Lanka in International Classical Music Conference in Germany in 1964]]\n\n=== Head of Music at the Ministry of Education ===\nIn 1975 Dunstan left the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC) to take up an appointment as the Head of Music at the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry Of Education (Sri Lanka)]]. His main task was to improve standards and develop the Music Syllabus for the schools and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka.\n\n== End of Career ==\nAfter two years of service at the Ministry of Education, he was called upon to the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] to take up office as the head of the Sinhalese Music Division. He served in this position till he retired in 1983.\n\nIn appreciation of the services he rendered to Sri Lankan Music, the Tower Hall Foundation honoured him by bestowing him with the most coveted Kalamanya award.\n\nOn the 16th November 1986, Dunstan received the Kalamanya award from the President of Sri Lanka, Hon [[J. R. Jayewardene|J.R Jayawardene]] and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R. Premadasa]].\n\nIn 1986 the National Television, [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini]] produced a two-year program called Pada Saraniiya\u00a0([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0daf \u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e ) comprising of music composed by Dunstan de Silva. His last music composition, Sithum Pathum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0940\u0925\u0941\u092e \u092a\u0925\u0941\u092e) sung by Deepika Priyadharshini was featured in this program.\n\nThis was his swansong.\n\nOn the 28 October 1988 Dunstan passed away due to a medical misadventure.\n\nThe name Dunstan de Siva, great musician, poet, artist and photographer will remain etched in the memories of the art loving public of Sri Lanka forever.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:de Silva, Dunstan}}\n\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:Sinhalese musicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{Peacock|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ariyaratne|first=Sunil|date=2013|title=Gandharva Apadana; No.04|url=http://opac.lib.sjp.ac.lk/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=111315&query_desc=se%2Cphr%3A%22Gandharva%20Apadana|journal=Gandharva Apadana; No.04|volume=|pages=83\u2013154|via=University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka}}</ref><br />{{Infobox person\n| name         = Dunstan de Silva\n| image        = Dunstan lihgtroom.jpg\n| caption      = \n| birth_name   = Patabandige Dunstan de Silva\n| birth_date   = {{birth-date|21 April 1921}}\n| birth_place  = [[Ambalangoda, Sri Lanka]]\n| death_date   = {{death-date and age|28 October 1988|21 April 1921}}\n| death_place  = [[Nugegoda, Sri Lanka]]\n| alma_mater   = [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], India - [[Ananda College]] Colombo - [[Nalanda College Colombo]]- Sidhdhartha College, Weligama, Sri Lanka\n| occupation   = Musician- Composer - Radio Music Program Director \u2013 Radio Broadcasting Music Standards Developer - University Lecturer - Arts Teacher - Photographer\n| years_active = 1954-1988\n| employer     = [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]]\n| known_for    = \n}}\n'''Dunstan de Silva''' was a Sri Lankan musician and a composer of Sinhalese music adorned with the title Visharad.

In his childhood, he had cultivated a habit of visiting the [[Weligama]] beach and playing a flute he had crafted himself, to the melodies he heard over the gramophone at home. His father was not happy with this practice but his mother was more sympathetic.\n\nHe started his primary education at Sidhdhartha College [[Weligama]] in 1930 and moved to [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College Colombo]], a leading school in Sri Lanka for his secondary education in 1936.

Because of this trust as a good friend and in recognition of his photography skills the Prime Minister Premadasa bestowed an honorary position on Dunstan as his personal photographer when he was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. This was a prestigious position where Dunstan had to work in a high security environment having access to personal events in the Prime Minister's life.\n\nWhile being engaged in music, he continued simultaneously with his photography too. In 1978 he produced all colour photos for a 213-page publication titled, An Album of Buddhist Paintings published by the National Archives compiled by Professor [[Siri Gunasinghe]]. Dunstan provided photos of 40 Temple Wall Paintings for this publication covering the ancient sites of Gadaladeniya, Maulgampola, Hanguranketha, Degaldoru, Madawala, Kotagala and [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla Rock Temple]].\n\n=== Musician ===\nDustan grew up listening to gramophone music at home. His passion for music was conceived and evolved over the gramophone music he was exposed to at home as a child that took him through a music career placing him finally as the Head of Sinhalese Music Division at the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).\n\nWhile engaging in his engineering studies at the Technical College, he followed two other passions that dearly touched his heart - Photography and Music. During this time an opportunity to play the flute for music programs in the [[Radio Ceylon]] came his way. He played the flute for the music programs of accomplished musicians [[Ananda Samarakoon]], Surya Shankar Molligoda and Anangalal Athukorala. The enticing lead accompaniment on the flute in Ananda Samarakoon's popular song of that vintage \"Punchi Suda Sudukatiya\" ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0dd4\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe; [[Hindi]]:\u092a\u0902\u091a \u0938\u0941\u0926\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e) is credited to de Silva.\n\nWhile being engaged in the photography business Dunstan continued to work on his prime passion of Music, which he studied at the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music Institute]]. In 1952 he composed music for the Opera Pushpa Shrungara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dca\u0db4 \u0dc1\u0dd8\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baa \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb1 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093e'' ) directed by [[Shesha Palihakkara]] dancer, film actor, and producer. Dunstan made his debut as a music composer for Pushpa Shrungara.\n\nDuring a period of 21 years from 1954 to 1975 as the Head of Sinhalese Music at [[Radio Ceylon]] and [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] Dunstan produced many popular programs such as\n\n*''Rasadhara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] :\u0dbb\u0dc3\u0db0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bbe ; [[Hindi]]:\u0930\u0938 \u0927\u0930\u093e )''\n*''Guwanviduli Geetha Nataka ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad \u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7\u0d9a; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0b95 ; [[Hindi]]: \u0917\u0941\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915  )''\n*''Vijaya Geetha ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4; [[Hindi]]: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e )''\n*''Raaga Rasa Vindhana ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db1; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95 \u00a0 \u0bb0\u0b9a \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9;  [[Hindi]]: \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0930\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e )''\n*''Sath Piyum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u00a0 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0920 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0941\u092e )''\n\nIn addition to being the producer he also composed music for these.\n\n=== Artist ===\nDespite spending his professional life mostly in music, he continued to engage in art which he practised since the time that he was the art teacher at Nalanda College. Dunstan designed the cover page of the significant publication called Sangeetha Sanhithaa<ref>{{Cite book|last=Abayasundara|first=Wimal|title=Sangeetha Sanhitha|publisher=S Godage Saha Sahodarayo|year=|isbn=9552055008|location=|pages=}}</ref> written by Eminent Sinhala poet and lyricist and Kalakeerthi Pundit Wimal Abeysundara.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Abeysundara|first=Wimal|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/06/13/news19.html|title=Wimal Abeysundara no more|date=|work=The Island|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Poet ===\n[[File:Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon.jpg|thumb|Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon Orchestra]]\nDunstan continued to write poems another-pastime that he had developed during his school years. He was a regular poet featured in leading English newspapers of Sri Lanka. There remain more than 50 unpublished poems written by Dunstan to date. One of those is \"The Flute\", which was the most sacred music instrument to him which he excelled in since early childhood. He used the flute to create his music compositions.\n\n\"The Flute\" is a beautiful poem Dunstan wrote about his beloved flute instrument which accompanied him from early life to the end of the life. He learnt music over the flute, his first job as a musician was to play the flute in [[Radio Ceylon]] orchestra and later he composed music using a flute.\n\n=== Visiting lecturer ===\n[[Lionel Edirisinghe]] Founder Principal of the Government Music College which later matured into the [[University of the Visual and Performing Arts]], offered a visiting lecturer position to Dunstan.\n\nWhen Dunstan became busy with his work at the Radio Ceylon producing music programs and working as a visiting lecture he didn't have enough time to spend on his photography business.\n\nThese dual engagements with the Radio Ceylon and the University competing for most of his time the simultaneous management of his photography business became untenable.\u00a0Consequently, he handed over his successful Studio Colour business to his brother Rohitha to continue.\n\n== Compositions ==\nFew of his compositions are;\n\n*\"Obata mathaka naa\"\u00a0 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd1]\n*\"Sudu piruwata andalaa\" (\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf)\n*\"Wanamal piyali salaa\" (\u0dc0\u0db1\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dcf)\n*\"Prakgna Pradeepa Dalwaa\" (\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da5\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4 \u0daf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf)\n*\"Oba dakumen yali jeewath wannata\" (\u0d94\u0db6 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7)\n*\"Pipunu malea ruwa\" (\u0db4\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc5\u0dda \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0)\n*\"Kahawan goyamata\" (\u0d9a\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dba\u0db8\u0da7)\n\n== Mentor ==\nDunstan was a mentor to many upcoming singers at his time in the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]]. When [[Sanath Nandasiri|Sanath Nanadasiri]] a stalwart of Sri Lankan music in later years returned to the country in 1965, conferred with a Visharad degree from the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhatkande Music Institute]], Dunstan extended him an opportunity to participate with a debut rendition as a new artist for the Navadali Hena radio musical. Dunstan called upon Somathilaka Jayamaha another musician who reached the top rungs later who worked as an admin officer in [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to the free music classes he conducted at YMBA Colombo. When Somathilaka finished the course Dunstan recruited him to the choir in his programs. Over time Somathilaka was promoted as an A-Grade singer and reached the upper echelons as an accomplished singer. Devananda Waidyasekara was also another talent Dunstan picked and groomed at [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to turn into an accomplished singer.\n\n== Two Milestones ==\nThe year 1954 marked two important milestones in his life. One was in his personal life and the other was in his professional life. On 24 February 1954 he married Hilda Fonseka from [[Wadduwa]]. Dunstan had met Hilda when she came to see her music teacher during the time she was a student at Sri Sumangala Girls School, Panadura. Gunaseana de Silva who studied at [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music institute]] with Dunstan proposed Hilda to Dunstan.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, Dunstan and Hilda were blessed with a precious daughter Ayanthi Manjula.\n\nIn the same year Dunstan got married, he received an invitation from the then Director General of the Radio Ceylon, [[M. J. Perera|M J Perera]], to join the Radio Ceylon. In 1954 Dunstan joined the Radio Ceylon as the Head of Sinhalese Music Programs.\n\nOn the 5th January 1967 Radio Ceylon was instituted as a public corporation as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He continued to serve as the head of Sinhalese Music Programs with the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n== Service to Sinhalese Music ==\nDuring his 21 years of service in the national broadcasting corporation, he dedicated his time to uplifting musical standards and developing Sinhalese music to evolve towards a Sri Lankan identity, moving away from the dependence on foreign tunes. His good friend Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva|W D Amaradeva]] contributed immensely to this endeavour with his own research efforts in this arena. \u00a0\n\nDunstan organised many classical music concerts inviting reputed singers and musicians from India affording Sri Lankan music lovers a chance to listen to them. He brought over his good friend legendary sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] five times to Sri Lanka. [[Lakshmi Shankar]], Ustad [[Alla Rakha|Allarakha]] Qureshi, [[V. G. Jog|Vishnu Govind Jog]], Pandit Dinkar Kaikini <ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaikini|first=Dinkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-events/A-tribute-to-Pandit-Dinkar-Kaikini/articleshow/7309862.cms|title=ETIMES|date=18 April 2020|work=Entertainment Times|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and Dipali Nag were other accomplished musicians he brought from India. \n[[File:Dunstan--Edit.jpg|thumb|L to R- Dunstan, his daughter and wife, Ravi Shankar, Laxmie Shankar and Ustad Allarakha Qureshi]]\nNone of those concerts were for commercial benefit. He organised those only to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan music lovers to listen to the music of those legends. There were times that he had to pocket out shortfalls in organising these concerts.\n\nDunstan was the founding secretary of the music subcommittee of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka which was a branch of the then [[Ministry of Higher Education and Highways|Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs]]. In 1959 he was appointed the President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1964 he represented Sri Lanka in the International Classical Music conference in Germany. \n[[File:Dunstan 4 lihgtroom.jpg|center|thumb|Dunstan representing Sri Lanka in International Classical Music Conference in Germany in 1964]]\n\n=== Head of Music at the Ministry of Education ===\nIn 1975 Dunstan left the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC) to take up an appointment as the Head of Music at the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry Of Education (Sri Lanka)]]. His main task was to improve standards and develop the Music Syllabus for the schools and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka.\n\n== End of Career ==\nAfter two years of service at the Ministry of Education, he was called upon to the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] to take up office as the head of the Sinhalese Music Division. He served in this position till he retired in 1983.\n\nIn appreciation of the services he rendered to Sri Lankan Music, the Tower Hall Foundation honoured him by bestowing him with the most coveted Kalamanya award.\n\nOn the 16th November 1986, Dunstan received the Kalamanya award from the President of Sri Lanka, Hon [[J. R. Jayewardene|J.R Jayawardene]] and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R. Premadasa]].\n\nIn 1986 the National Television, [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini]] produced a two-year program called Pada Saraniiya\u00a0([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0daf \u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e ) comprising of music composed by Dunstan de Silva. His last music composition, Sithum Pathum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0940\u0925\u0941\u092e \u092a\u0925\u0941\u092e) sung by Deepika Priyadharshini was featured in this program.\n\nThis was his swansong.\n\nOn the 28 October 1988 Dunstan passed away due to a medical misadventure.\n\nThe name Dunstan de Siva, great musician, poet, artist and photographer will remain etched in the memories of the art loving public of Sri Lanka forever.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:de Silva, Dunstan}}\n\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:Sinhalese musicians]]\n", "name_user": "HarinMusic", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstan_de_Silva"}

The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of a single round within a six-minute limit. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Habu Ahmed Gumel, [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] member, Nigeria, and the gifts were presented by Pedro Gama Filho, [[United World Wrestling]] board

The play consists of multiple subplots that revolve around the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. One subplot revolves around a conflict between four Athenian lovers, one about a group of six amateur actors who has to act out their interpretation of the play 'Pyramus and Thisbe' at the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. These subplots take place in a forest, inhabited by fairies who control the characters of the play. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.\n\n==Characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em|rules=yes}}\n* [[Theseus]]\u2014[[Duke of Athens]]\n* [[Hippolyta]]\u2014Queen of the [[Amazons]]\n* [[Egeus]]\u2014father of Hermia \n* [[Hermia]]\u2014daughter of Egeus, in love with Lysander\n* [[Lysander (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Lysander]]\u2014in love with Hermia\n* [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]]\u2014suitor to Hermia, former lover of Helena\n* [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]]\u2014in love with Demetrius\n* [[Philostrate]]\u2014[[Master of the Revels]]\n* [[Peter Quince]]\u2014a [[carpenter]]\n* [[Nick Bottom]]\u2014a [[weaving|weaver]]\n* [[Francis Flute]]\u2014a [[bellows]]-mender\n* [[Tom Snout]]\u2014a [[tinker]]\n* [[Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Snug]]\u2014a [[joiner]]\n* [[Robin Starveling]]\u2014a tailor\n* [[Oberon]]\u2014King of the Fairies\n* [[Titania]]\u2014Queen of the Fairies\n* [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Robin \"Puck\" Goodfellow]]\u2014a mischievous [[Sprite (folklore)|sprite]] with magical powers\n* Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth and Mustardseed\u2014fairy servants to Titania\n* Indian changeling\u2014a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of Titania\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Plot ==\n[[File:HermiaandHelena.jpg|thumb|upright|Hermia and Helena by [[Washington Allston]], 1818]]\nThe play consists of four interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke [[Theseus]] of [[Athens]] and the [[Amazons|Amazon]] queen, [[Hippolyta]], and set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of [[Fairy]]land, under the light of the moon.\n\nThe play opens with [[Hermia]], who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father [[Egeus]]'s demand that she wed [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]], whom he has arranged for her to marry. [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]], Hermia's best friend, pines [[Unrequited love|unrequitedly]] for Demetrius, who broke up with her to be with Hermia. Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian [[law]] before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter needs to marry a  suitor chosen by her father, or else face death. Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong [[chastity]] as a [[nun]] worshipping the goddess [[Artemis]].\n\n[[Peter Quince]] and his fellow players [[Nick Bottom]], [[Francis Flute]], [[Robin Starveling]], [[Tom Snout]] and [[Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Snug]] plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, \"the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]]\". Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them on the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. Quince insists that Bottom can only play the role of Pyramus. Bottom would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of [[Hercules|Ercles]]. Bottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players [[Hanging|hanged]]. Snug remarks that he needs the Lion's part because he is \"slow of study\". Quince assures Snug that the role of the lion is \"nothing but roaring.\" Quince then ends the meeting telling his actors \"at the Duke's oak we meet\".\n\n[[File:Sir Joseph Noel Paton - The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|''The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania'' by [[Joseph Noel Paton]], 1849]]\nIn a parallel plot line, [[Oberon]], king of the fairies, and [[Titania]], his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian [[changeling]] to Oberon for use as his \"knight\" or \"henchman\", since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience. He calls upon Robin \"[[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]]\" Goodfellow, his \"shrewd and knavish sprite\", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called \"[[love-in-idleness]]\", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, \"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me.\"\n\nHermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of running away from Theseus. Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of finding Hermia. Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man. Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Helena, thinking Lysander is playing a trick on her, runs away with Lysander following her. When Hermia wakes up, she sees that Lysander is gone and goes out in the woods to find him. Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia, who thinks Demetrius killed Lysander, and is enraged. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, he sees Helena. Now, both men are in love with Helena. However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia finds Lysander and asks why he left her, but Lysander claims he never loved Hermia, just Helena. Hermia accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her while Helena believes Hermia joined the two men in mocking her. Hermia tries to attack Helena, but the two men protect Helena. Lysander, tired of Hermia's presence, insults her and tells her to leave. Lysander and Demetrius decide to seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater. The two women go their own separate ways, Helena hoping to reach Athens and Hermia chasing after the men to make sure Lysander doesn't get hurt or killed. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.\n\n[[File:My Mistress with a Monster is in Love.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Puck, Titania and Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream from Act III, Scene II by [[Charles Buchel]], 1905]]\nMeanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers (\"rude [[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]]\", as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's [[dwelling|bower]], for their rehearsal. Quince leads the actors in their rehearsal of the play. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a [[Donkey|jackass]]) transforms his head into that of a [[donkey]]. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him. She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the [[changeling]] boy. Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, returning his love to Hermia again, and claiming all will be well in the morning.\n\nThe fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They find the lovers still sleeping in the glade. They wake up the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers at first believe they are still in a dream and can't recall what has happened. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream. After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream \"past the wit of man\".\n\nAt Quince's house, he and his team of actors worry that Bottom has gone missing. Quince laments that Bottom is the only man who can take on the lead role of Pyramus. Bottom returns, and the actors get ready to put on \"Pyramus and Thisbe.\"\n\nIn Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform ''Pyramus and Thisbe.'' The performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After all the other characters leave, Puck \"restores amends\" and suggests that what the [[audience]] experienced might just be a dream.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Midsummer Night's Dream Henry Fuseli2.jpg|thumb|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' act IV, scene I. Engraving from the painting ''[[Titania and Bottom]]'' by [[Henry Fuseli]], published 1796]]\nIt is unknown exactly when ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written or first performed, but on the basis of topical references and an allusion to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Epithalamion (poem)|Epithalamion]]'', it is usually dated 1595 or early 1596. Some have theorised that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding (for example that of [[Elizabeth Carey, Lady Berkeley]]), while others suggest that it was written for the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to celebrate the [[Midsummer Day|feast day]] of [[John the Apostle|St. John]], but no  evidence exists to support this theory. In any case, it would have been performed at [[The Theatre]] and, later, [[Globe Theater|The Globe]]. Though it is not a translation or adaptation of an earlier work, various sources such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and [[Chaucer]]'s \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\" served as inspiration.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=lix}} According to John Twyning, the play's plot of four lovers undergoing a trial in the woods was intended as a \"riff\" on ''[[Der Busant]]'', a [[Middle High German]] poem.{{sfn|Twyning|2012|p=77}}\n\nAccording to Dorothea Kehler, the writing period can be placed between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had probably already completed ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and was still in contemplation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. The play belongs to the author's early-middle period, a time when Shakespeare devoted primary attention to the [[lyricism]] of his works.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=3}}\n\n==Date and text==\n[[File:First Quarto Printing of A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|left|The title page from the first quarto, printed in 1600]]\nThe play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] on 8 October 1600 by the bookseller [[Thomas Fisher (printer)|Thomas Fisher]], who published the [[first quarto]] edition later that year.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=xxi}} A [[second quarto]] was printed in 1619 by [[William Jaggard]], as part of his so-called [[False Folio]].{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=xxi}} The play next appeared in print in the [[First Folio]] of 1623. The title page of [[first quarto|Q1]] states that the play was \"sundry times publickely acted\" prior to 1600.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=lvii}} The first performance known with certainty occurred at Court on 1 January 1604.\n\n==Themes and motifs==\n===Lovers' bliss===\n\nIn [[Ancient Greece]], long before the creation of the Christian celebrations of [[Midsummer|St. John's Day]], the summer solstice was marked by [[Adonia]], a festival to mourn the death of [[Adonis]], the devoted mortal lover of the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. According to [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's Metamorphoses]], Aphrodite took the orphaned infant Adonis to the [[underworld]] to be raised by [[Persephone]]. He grew to be a beautiful young man, and when Aphrodite returned to retrieve him, Persephone did not want to let him go. Zeus settled the dispute by giving Adonis one-third of the year with Persephone, one-third of the year with Aphrodite, and the remaining third where he chose. Adonis chose to spend two-thirds of the year with his paramour, Aphrodite. He bled to death in his lover's arms after being gored by a boar. Mythology has various stories attributing the color of certain flowers to staining by the blood of Adonis or Aphrodite.\n\nThe story of Venus and Adonis was well known to the Elizabethans and inspired many works, including Shakespeare's own hugely popular narrative poem, [[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]], written while London's theaters were closed because of plague. It was published in 1593.<ref>[[Venus_and_Adonis_(Shakespeare_poem)]]</ref>\n\nThe wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta and the mistaken and waylaid lovers, Titania and Bottom, even the erstwhile acting troupe, model various aspects (and forms) of love.\n\n===Carnivalesque===\nBoth David Wiles of the [[University of London]] and [[Harold Bloom]] of [[Yale University]] have strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes of [[Carnivalesque]], [[Bacchanalia]], and [[Saturnalia]].{{sfn|Wiles|2008|pp=208\u201323}} Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: \"The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although we encounter ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, and part of the festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre in the months that followed became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration.\"  {{sfn|Wiles|2008|p=213}} Wiles argued in 1993 that the play was written to celebrate the Carey-Berkeley wedding. The date of the wedding was fixed to coincide with a conjunction of Venus and the new moon, highly propitious for conceiving an heir.<ref>Wiles 1993</ref>\n\n===Love===\n[[File:Simmons-Hermia and Lysander. A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|''Hermia and Lysander'' by [[John Simmons (painter)|John Simmons]] (1870)]]\n[[David Bevington]] argues that the play represents the dark side of love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her to fall in love with an ass.{{sfn|Bevington|1996|pp=24\u201335}} In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it.{{sfn|Bevington|1996|p=32}} Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.\n\n===Problem with time===\nThere is a dispute over the scenario of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that \"four happy days bring in another moon\".<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.I.2\u20133.</ref> The wood episode then takes place at a night of no moon, but Lysander asserts that there will be so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls.<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.I.208\u201313.</ref> Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight,<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.II.90\u20139.</ref> which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus's statement can also be interpreted to mean \"four days until the next month\". Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the moon is not seen due to its closeness to the sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a liminal \"dark of the moon\" period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta's opening lines exclaiming \"And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.\"; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon's return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title with [[May Day]], furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they \"observe The rite of May\".<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', IV.I.131\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Loss of individual identity===\n[[File:Edwin Landseer - Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin Landseer]], ''[[Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom]]'' (1848)]]\n\nMaurice Hunt, Chair of the English Department at [[Baylor University]], writes of the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality in the play that make possible \"that pleasing, narcotic dreaminess associated with the fairies of the play\".{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} By emphasising this theme, even in the setting of the play, Shakespeare prepares the reader's mind to accept the fantastic reality of the fairy world and its happenings. This also seems to be the axis around which the plot conflicts in the play occur. Hunt suggests that it is the breaking down of individual identities that leads to the central conflict in the story.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} It is the brawl between Oberon and Titania, based on a lack of recognition for the other in the relationship, that drives the rest of the drama in the story and makes it dangerous for any of the other lovers to come together due to the disturbance of Nature caused by a fairy dispute.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower's juice on Lysander's eyes instead of Demetrius'.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}}\n\nVictor Kiernan, a Marxist scholar and historian, writes that it is for the greater sake of love that this loss of identity takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: \"It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes.\"{{sfn|Kiernan|1993|p=212}} He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: \"It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships.\"{{sfn|Kiernan|1993|p=210}}\n\nThe aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes \"Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered.\"{{sfn|Marshall|1982}} In Marshall's opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare's opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that \"To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part.\"{{sfn|Marshall|1982}} He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. As the primary sense of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story's overall mood.{{sfn|Marshall|1982}}\n\n===Ambiguous sexuality===\n[[File:Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli 007.jpg|thumb|left|''The Awakening of the Fairy Queen Titania'']]\nIn his essay \"Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream\",'' Douglas E. Green explores possible interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds within the text of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay \"does not (seek to) rewrite ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as a gay play but rather explores some of its 'homoerotic significations'&nbsp;... moments of 'queer' disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy.\"{{sfn|Green|1998|p=370}}\n\nGreen does not consider Shakespeare to have been a \"sexual radical\", but that the play represented a \"topsy-turvy world\" or \"temporary holiday\" that mediates or negotiates the \"discontents of civilisation\", which while resolved neatly in the story's conclusion, do not resolve so neatly in real life.{{sfn|Green|1998|p=375}} Green writes that the \"sodomitical elements\", \"[[homoeroticism]]\", \"lesbianism\", and even \"compulsory heterosexuality\"\u2014the first hint of which may be Oberon's obsession with Titania's changeling ward\u2014in the story must be considered in the context of the \"culture of early modern England\" as a commentary on the \"aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order\".{{sfn|Green|1998|p=375}} Aspects of ambiguous sexuality and gender conflict in the story are also addressed in essays by Shirley Garner and William W.E. Slights albeit all the characters are played by males.{{sfn|Garner|1998|pp=129\u201330}}{{sfn|Slights|1988|p=261}}\n\n===Feminism===\n[[File:Edward Robert Hughes - Midsummer Eve (1908c).jpg|thumb|upright|''Midsummer Eve'' by [[Edward Robert Hughes]] c. 1908]]\nMale dominance is one thematic element found in the play. In ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Lysander and Hermia escape into the woods for a night where they do not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage is seen as the ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition.{{sfn|Howard|2003|p=414}} In ''The Imperial Votaress'', Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, \"The festive conclusion in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands.\"{{sfn|Montrose|2000|p=65}} He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection is drawn between flowers and sexuality. Montrose sees the juice employed by Oberon as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the \"sexual blood shed by 'virgins'\". While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman's power, blood as a result of a first sexual encounter represents man's power over women.{{sfn|Montrose|2000|pp=61\u201369}}\n\nThere are points in the play, however, when there is an absence of patriarchal control. In his book ''Power on Display'', Leonard Tennenhouse says the problem in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is the problem of \"authority gone archaic\".{{sfn|Tennenhouse|1986|p=73}} The Athenian law requiring a daughter to die if she does not do her father's will is outdated. Tennenhouse contrasts the patriarchal rule of Theseus in Athens with that of Oberon in the carnivalistic Faerie world. The disorder in the land of the fairies completely opposes the world of Athens. He states that during times of carnival and festival, male power is broken down. For example, what happens to the four lovers in the woods as well as Bottom's dream represents chaos that contrasts with Theseus' political order. However, Theseus does not punish the lovers for their disobedience. According to Tennenhouse, by forgiving the lovers, he has made a distinction between the law of the patriarch (Egeus) and that of the monarch (Theseus), creating two different voices of authority. This  can be compared to the time of [[Elizabeth I]], in which monarchs were seen as having two bodies: the body natural and the body politic. Tennenhouse says that Elizabeth's succession itself represented both the voice of a patriarch and the voice of a monarch: (1) her father's will, which stated that the crown should pass to her and (2) the fact that she was the daughter of a king.{{sfn|Tennenhouse|1986|Pp=74\u201376}}\n\n==Criticism and interpretation==\n===Critical history===\n====17th century====\n[[File:Samuel Pepys.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samuel Pepys]], who wrote the oldest known comments on the play, found ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' to be \"the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}]]\nDorothea Kehler has attempted to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism that she found was a 1662 entry in the diary of [[Samuel Pepys]]. He found the play to be \"the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} He did, however, admit that it had \"some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\nThe next critic known to comment on the play was [[John Dryden]], writing in 1677. He was preoccupied with the question of whether [[Fairy|fairies]] should be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive from [[popular belief]]. And fairies are of this sort, as are [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pigmies]] and the extraordinary effects of [[Magic (paranormal)|magick]]. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays: ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', and [[Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson's]] ''[[The Masque of Queens|Masque of Witches]]''.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\n====18th century====\n[[Charles Gildon]] in the early 18th century recommended this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works of [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]], and that he could read them in the original [[Latin]] and not in later translations.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\n[[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]], writing in the 1770s, also recommended this play. He felt the depiction of the supernatural was among Shakespeare's strengths, not weaknesses. He especially praised the poetry and wit of the fairies, and the quality of the verse involved.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} His contemporary [[Francis Gentleman]], an admirer of Shakespeare, was much less appreciative of this play. He felt that the poetry, the characterisation, and the originality of the play were its strengths, but that its major weaknesses were a \"puerile\" plot and that it consists of an odd mixture of incidents. The connection of the incidents to each other seemed rather forced to Gentleman.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n[[Edmond Malone]], a Shakespearean scholar and critic of the late 18th century, found another supposed flaw in this particular play, its lack of a proper [[decorum]]. He found that the \"more exalted characters\" (the aristocrats of Athens) are subservient to the interests of those beneath them. In other words, the lower-class characters play larger roles than their betters and overshadow them. He found this to be a grave error of the writer. Malone thought that this play had to be an early and immature work of Shakespeare and, by implication, that an older writer would know better. Malone's main argument seems to derive from the [[Class discrimination|classism]] of his era. He assumes that the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] had to receive more attention in the narrative and to be more important, more distinguished, and better than the lower class.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}}\n\n====19th century====\n[[Image:William Hazlitt self-portrait (1802).jpg|thumb|right|[[William Hazlitt]] preferred reading ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' over watching it acted on stage.]]\nAccording to Kehler, significant 19th-century criticism began in 1808 with [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]]. Schlegel perceived unity in the multiple plot lines. He noted that the donkey's head is not a random transformation, but reflects Bottom's true nature. He identified the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe as a [[burlesque]] of the Athenian lovers.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} In 1817, [[William Hazlitt]] found the play to be better as a written work than a staged production. He found the work to be \"a delightful fiction\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} but when staged, it is reduced to a dull [[pantomime]]. He concluded that poetry and the stage do not fit together.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} Kehler finds the comment to be more of an indication of the quality of the theatrical productions available to Hazlitt, rather than a true indication of the play's supposed unsuitability to the stage. She notes that prior to the 1840s, all stage productions of this play were adaptations unfaithful to the original text.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}}\n\nIn 1811\u20131812, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] made two points of criticism about this play. The first was that the entire play should be seen as a [[dream]]. Second, that Helena is guilty of \"ungrateful treachery\" to Hermia. He thought that this was a reflection of the lack of [[principle]]s in women, who are more likely to follow their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moral [[evil]], though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introduce [[gender]] issues to the analysis of this play. Kehler dismisses his views on Helena as indications of Coleridge's own [[misogyny]], rather than genuine reflections of Helena's morality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n[[File:Augustins - La Folie de Titania - Paul Jean Gervais 1897 2004 1 188.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Maginn]] thought Bottom a lucky man and was particularly amused that he treats Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, \"as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}]]\nIn 1837, [[William Maginn]] produced essays on the play. He turned his attention to Theseus' speech about \"the lunatic, the lover, and the poet\"{{efn|Theseus' \"The lunatic, the lover, and the poet\" speech is in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' V.I.2\u201322.<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' V.I.2\u201322.</ref>}} and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whom [[Fortuna|Fortune]] showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the [[Titania|fairy queen]]: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that \"Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}} Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the \"caprices\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}} of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}\n\nIn 1839, the philosopher [[Hermann Ulrici]] wrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views of [[Platonism]]. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream, suggesting influence from [[Plato]] and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of [[parody]] about class differences.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}\n\n[[James Halliwell-Phillipps]], writing in the 1840s, found that there were many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} \n\nIn 1849, [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] also wrote about the play and its apparent lack of proper [[social stratification]]. He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare's maturity as a playwright, and that its \"Thesean harmony\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be \"subtle and ethereal\", and standing above [[literary criticism]] and its reductive reasoning.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n[[File:Lysander declaring his passion to Helena (Smirke, c. 1820-1825).jpg|thumb|right|[[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] thought Hermia lacking in [[filial piety]] and devoid of conscience for running away with Lysander, himself not a shining beacon of virtue (here seen wooing Helena).{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}]]\nAlso in 1849, [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] wrote extensively about the play. He denied the theory that this play should be seen as a dream. He argued that it should be seen as an ethical construct and an [[allegory]]. He thought that it was an allegorical depiction of the errors of sensual love, which is likened to a dream. In his view, Hermia lacks in [[Filial piety|filial obedience]] and acts as if devoid of conscience when she runs away with Lysander. Lysander is also guilty for disobeying and mocking his prospective father-in-law. Pyramus and Thisbe also lack in filial obedience, since they \"woo by moonlight\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} behind their parents' backs. The fairies, in his view, should be seen as \"personified dream gods\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} They represent the caprices of superficial love, and they lack in intellect, feeling, and ethics.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}\n\nGervinus also wrote on where the [[fairyland]] of the play is located. Not in [[Attica]], but in the [[Indies]]. His views on the Indies seem to Kehler to be influenced by [[Orientalism]]. He speaks of the Indies as scented with the [[odour|aroma]] of flowers and as the place where mortals live in the state of a half-dream. Gervinus denies and devalues the loyalty of Titania to her friend. He views this supposed friendship as not grounded in spiritual association. Titania merely \"delight in her beauty, her 'swimming gait,' and her powers of imitation\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} Gervinus further views Titania as an immoral character for not trying to reconcile with her husband. In her resentment, Titania seeks separation from him, which Gervinus blames her for.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}\n\nGervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations. He described them as homely creatures with \"hard hands and thick heads\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} They are, in his view, ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward. They are not real artists. Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus, who he thinks represents the intellectual man. Like several of his predecessors, Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}\n\n[[File:Charles Cowden Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Cowden Clarke]] appreciated the [[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]], and in particular found [[Nick Bottom]] conceited but good-natured and imaginative.]]\nIn 1863, [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar [[Mary Cowden Clarke]]. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nIn 1872, Henry N. Hudson, an American clergyman and editor of Shakespeare, also wrote comments on this play. Kehler pays little attention to his writings, as they were largely derivative of previous works. She notes, however, that Hudson too believed that the play should be viewed as a dream. He cited the lightness of the characterisation as supporting of his view.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} In 1881, [[Edward Dowden]] argued that Theseus and his reflections on art are central to the play. He also argued that Theseus was one of the \"heroic men of action\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} so central to Shakespeare's theatrical works.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}}\n\n[[Image:Horace Howard Furness.jpg|thumb|left|[[Horace Howard Furness]] defended ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' from claims of inconsistency, and felt this did not detract from the quality of the play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}]]\nBoth [[Horace Howard Furness]] and Henry Austin Clapp were more concerned with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} Furness, defending the play in 1895, felt that the apparent inconsistency did not detract from the play's quality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} \n\nIn 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a [[dialectic]], either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one. For failing to live in peace with Oberon and her kind, Titania is sentenced to fall in love with a human. And this human, unlike Oberon is a \"horrid brute\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}}\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, [[Georg Brandes]] (1895\u20136) and [[Frederick S. Boas]] (1896) were the last major additions to ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' criticism.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} Brandes' approach to anticipates later [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychological readings]], seeing Oberon's magic as symbolic and \"typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the \"domain of the unconscious\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, \"essentially English and Elizabethan\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to \"concentrate the four lovers on a single spot\";{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} and the ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' play-within-the-play a parody of a prominent ''[[topos]]'' of contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: \"This is recognizably modern criticism.\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}}\n\n====20th century====\nThe 20th century brought new insights into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the [[artisan]]s. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working in this play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Also in 1961, [[Frank Kermode]] wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of [[Macrobius]], [[Apuleius]], and [[Giordano Bruno]]. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] by [[Paul the Apostle]], dealing with divine love.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}}{{efn|Specifically, Bottom alludes to I Corinthians 2:9.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}}}}\n\nIn 1964, R.W. Dent argued against theories that the exemplary model of love in the play is the rational love of Theseus and Hippolyta. He argued that in this work, love is inexplicable. It is the offspring of imagination, not reason. However the exemplary love of the play is one of an imagination controlled and restrained, and avoids the excesses of \"dotage\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Genuine love is contrasted with the [[unrequited love]] (and dotage) of Demetrius for Hermia, and with the supposed love (and dotage) of Titania for an unworthy object.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nDent also denied the rationality and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers that this is the character of [[Theseus]] from [[Greek mythology]], a creation himself of \"antique fable\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He can't tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nAlso in 1964, [[Jan Kott]] offered his own views on the play. He viewed as main themes of the play violence and \"unrepressed animalistic sexuality\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, their love interests are exchangeable and [[Objectification|objectified]]. The [[changeling]] that Oberon desires is his new \"sexual toy\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, are [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed to talk about it because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} Kott's views were controversial and contemporary critics wrote, either in favour of or against Kott's views, but few ignored them.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}}\n\nIn 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is a symbol of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was redeemed through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the \"terrifying power\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} of the fairies and argued that they control the play's events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethically [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] characters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play's audience can have no singular answer or meaning.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=30\u20131}}\n\nIn 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=31}}\n\nIn 1970, R.A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The play uses the principle of ''[[Enantiosis|discordia concors]]'' in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has to give up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=31}}\n\nIn 1971, James L. Calderwood offered a new view on the role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts of [[illusion]]. Oberon, in his view, is the interior dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nAlso in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play's actual theme is unity. The poet's imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and the writer is addressing the spectator's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare's allusion to the \"eternal truths\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}} of [[Platonism]] and Christianity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}}\n\nAlso writing in 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely new view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is actually a [[Self-destructive behaviour|self-destructive]] expression of [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At the same time it protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own [[egotism]] protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}}\n\nIn 1971, Neil Taylor argued that there was a double time-scheme in the play, making it seem to last a minimum of four nights but to also be timeless.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\nIn 1972, Ralph Berry argued that Shakespeare was chiefly concerned with [[epistemology]] in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}} Also in 1972, [[Thomas McFarland]] argued that the play is dominated by a mood of happiness and that it is one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1974, [[Marjorie Garber]] argued that metamorphosis is both the major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses on the story of the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}}\n\nIn 1975, Ronald F. Miller expresses his view that the play is a study in the epistemology of imagination. He focused on the role of the fairies, who have a mysterious aura of evanescence and ambiguity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} Also in 1975, [[David Bevington]] offered his own reading of the play. He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may be [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is \"unknowable and incomprehensible\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}}\n\nIn 1977, [[Anne Paolucci]] argued that the play lasts five days.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\nIn 1979, M. E. Lamb suggested that the play may have borrowed an aspect of the ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the [[Labyrinth]] of the [[Minotaur]]. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]] the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes [[Ariadne|Ariadne's]] thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, [[Daedalus]]. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAlso in 1979, Harold F. Brooks agreed that the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its culmination in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}} In 1980, Florence Falk offered a view of the play based on theories of [[cultural anthropology]]. She argued that the play is about traditional [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to the ''[[communitas]]'' of the woods. The woods serve here as the ''communitas'', a temporary aggregate for persons whose asocial desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the asocial can be contained. Falk identified this ''communitas'' with the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is \"''societas''\", the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism of ''communitas'' and structure.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}}\n\nAlso in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. offered a Christian view of the play. The experience of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them \"a new humility, a healthy sense of folly\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}} They realise that there are things that are true despite the fact that they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Puck (29391431162).jpg|thumb|left|Alex Aronson considered Puck a representation of the [[unconscious mind]] and a contrast to Theseus as a representation of the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]].{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}}]]\nSome of the interpretations of the play have been based on [[psychology]] and its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and Puck represents the [[unconscious mind]]. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as a [[trickster]], while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept of [[fertility]]. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers' sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}} In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers can not simply return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their \"authentic sexual selves\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}} In 1979, [[Norman N. Holland]] applied [[psychoanalytic literary criticism]] to the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia as if it was a real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia's sexual development. Her search for options is her [[Defence mechanisms|defence mechanism]]. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}}\n\nIn 1981, Mordecai Marcus argued for a new meaning of [[Eros]] (Love) and [[Thanatos]] (Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare suggests that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release of [[sexual tension]]. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love is connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=40\u20131}}\n\nIn 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely argued that this play has a therapeutic value. Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, releases them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony. [[Patriarchy]] itself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania's loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom as a metaphor for basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}} In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters' fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}}\n\nIn 1991, Barbara Freedman argued that the play justifies the ideological formation of [[absolute monarchy]], and makes visible for examination the maintenance process of [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] order.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}}\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Second Folio Printing of A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|The first page printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the years of the [[Puritan]] [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] when the theatres were closed (1642\u20131660), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a [[droll]]. Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama. When the theatres re-opened in 1660, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. [[Samuel Pepys]] saw it on 29&nbsp;September 1662 and thought it \"''the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw&nbsp;...''\"{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=142\u201343, 316\u201317}}\n\nAfter the Jacobean / Caroline era, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was never performed in its entirety until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like [[Henry Purcell]]'s musical masque/play [[The Fairy-Queen|The Fairy Queen]] (1692), which had a successful run at the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]], but was not revived. [[Richard Leveridge]] turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in 1716. [[John Frederick Lampe]] elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of ''Love in a Forest'', his 1723 adaptation of ''[[As You Like It]]''. In 1755, [[David Garrick]] did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called ''The Fairies.'' Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=255, 271, 278, 316\u201317, 410}}\n\n===The Victorian stage===\nIn 1840, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] at [[Covent Garden]] returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, adding musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] would always be played by women.{{sfn|RSC|n.d.}}\n\nAfter the success of Madame Vestris' production, [[19th-century theatre]] continued to stage the ''Dream'' as a spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies were portrayed as gossamer-winged ballerinas. The [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|overture]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] was always used throughout this period. [[Augustin Daly]]'s production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://shakespeare.emory.edu/a-midsummer-nights-dream/|title=A Midsummer Night's Dream {{!}} Shakespeare and the Players|website=shakespeare.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n[[File:MidsummerPuckFlying.jpg|thumb|upright|Vince Cardinale as Puck from the Carmel Shakespeare Festival production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', September 2000]]\n[[File:SarTerem 9.jpg|thumb|Performance by Saratov Puppet Theatre \"Teremok\" ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' based on the play by William Shakespeare (2007)]]\n[[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] staged a 1911 production which featured \"mechanical birds twittering in beech trees, a simulated stream, fairies wearing battery-operated lighting, and live rabbits following trails of food across the stage.\"{{sfn|Kimber|2006|p=201}}\n[[File:A Midsummer Night's Dream at The Doon School.jpg|thumb|A 2010 production of the play at [[The Doon School]], India]]\n\n[[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] staged ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' thirteen times between 1905 and 1934,{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=31}} introducing a revolving set.{{sfn|Mancewicz|2014|p=12}} After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in September 1934.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=31}} The shell was removed and replaced by a forest planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=36}} The wedding procession inserted between Acts&nbsp;IV and V crossed the trestle with torches down the hillside.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=36\u201337}} The cast included [[James Cagney]],{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=51\u201352}} [[Olivia de Havilland]],{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=38, 46}} [[Mickey Rooney]],{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=37\u201338, 46}} [[Victor Jory]] and a corps of dancers that included [[Butterfly McQueen]]. {{sfn|Gibson|1996|p=3}} The play was accompanied by Mendelssohn's music.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nOn the strength of this production, [[Warner Brothers]] signed Reinhardt to direct [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|a filmed version]], Hollywood's first Shakespeare movie since [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks Sr.]] and [[Mary Pickford]]'s ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' in 1929.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=41}} Jory (Oberon), Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) reprised their roles from the Hollywood Bowl cast.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=46\u201347}} [[James Cagney]] starred, in his only Shakespearean role, as Bottom.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=52}} Other actors in the film who played Shakespearean roles just this once included [[Joe E.

In 1842, partly because of the fame of the overture, and partly because his employer [[Frederick William&nbsp;IV of Prussia|King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]] liked the [[incidental music]] that Mendelssohn had written for other plays that had been staged at the palace in German translation, Mendelssohn was commissioned to write incidental music for a production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' that was to be staged in 1843 in [[Potsdam]]. He incorporated the existing Overture into the incidental music, which was used in most stage versions through the 19th century. The best known of the pieces from the incidental music is the famous ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]'', frequently used as a [[Recessional hymn|recessional]] in weddings.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe choreographer [[Marius Petipa]], more famous for his collaborations with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] (on the ballets ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'') made another ballet adaptation for the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] with additional music and adaptations to Mendelssohn's score by [[Ludwig Minkus|L\u00e9on Minkus]]. The revival premiered 14 July 1876. English choreographer [[Frederick Ashton]] also created a 40-minute ballet version of the play, retitled to ''The Dream''. [[George Balanchine]] was another to create a ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet)|Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' ballet based on the play, using Mendelssohn's music.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1939 [[Carl Orff]] also wrote incidental music for a German version of the play, ''Ein Sommernachtstraum'' (performed in 1939). Since Mendelssohn's parents were Jews who converted to Lutheranism, his music had been banned by the Nazi regime, and the Nazi cultural officials put out a call for new music for the play: Orff was one of the musicians who responded. He later reworked the music for a final version, completed in 1964.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n\"Over Hill, Over Dale\", from Act 2, is the third of the ''[[Three Shakespeare Songs]]'' set to music by the British composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. He wrote the pieces for a cappella SATB choir in 1951 for the British Federation of Music Festivals, and they remain a popular part of British choral repertoire today.\n\nThe [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|play was adapted into an opera]], with music by [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[libretto]] by Britten and [[Peter Pears]]. The opera was first performed on 11 June 1960 at [[Aldeburgh]].{{sfn|Whittall|1998}}\n\nThe theatre company, Moonwork put on a production of ''Midsummer'' in 1999. It was conceived by Mason Pettit, Gregory Sherman and Gregory Wolfe (who directed it).

Neumeier devotes the three sharply differing musical styles to the three character groups, with the aristocrats and nobles dancing to Mendelssohn, the fairies to Ligeti, and the rustics or mechanicals to the barrel organ.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006}}\n* [[Elvis Costello]] composed the music for a full-length ballet ''[[Il Sogno]]'', based on ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.

The play consists of multiple subplots that revolve around the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. One subplot revolves around a conflict between four Athenian lovers, one about a group of six amateur actors who has to act out their interpretation of the play 'Pyramus and Thisbe' at the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. These subplots take place in a forest, inhabited by fairies who control the characters of the play. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.\n\n==Characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em|rules=yes}}\n* [[Theseus]]\u2014[[Duke of Athens]]\n* [[Hippolyta]]\u2014Queen of the [[Amazons]]\n* [[Egeus]]\u2014father of Hermia \n* [[Hermia]]\u2014daughter of Egeus, in love with Lysander\n* [[Lysander (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Lysander]]\u2014in love with Hermia\n* [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]]\u2014suitor to Hermia, former lover of Helena\n* [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]]\u2014in love with Demetrius\n* [[Philostrate]]\u2014[[Master of the Revels]]\n* [[Peter Quince]]\u2014a [[carpenter]]\n* [[Nick Bottom]]\u2014a [[weaving|weaver]]\n* [[Francis Flute]]\u2014a [[bellows]]-mender\n* [[Tom Snout]]\u2014a [[tinker]]\n* [[Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Snug]]\u2014a [[joiner]]\n* [[Robin Starveling]]\u2014a tailor\n* [[Oberon]]\u2014King of the Fairies\n* [[Titania]]\u2014Queen of the Fairies\n* [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Robin \"Puck\" Goodfellow]]\u2014a mischievous [[Sprite (folklore)|sprite]] with magical powers\n* Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth and Mustardseed\u2014fairy servants to Titania\n* Indian changeling\u2014a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of Titania\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Plot ==\n[[File:HermiaandHelena.jpg|thumb|upright|Hermia and Helena by [[Washington Allston]], 1818]]\nThe play consists of four interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke [[Theseus]] of [[Athens]] and the [[Amazons|Amazon]] queen, [[Hippolyta]], which are set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of [[Fairy]]land, under the light of the moon.\n\nThe play opens with [[Hermia]], who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father [[Egeus]]'s demand that she wed [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]], whom he has arranged for her to marry. [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]], Hermia's best friend, pines [[Unrequited love|unrequitedly]] for Demetrius, who broke up with her to be with Hermia. Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian [[law]] before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter needs to marry a  suitor chosen by her father, or else face death. Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong [[chastity]] as a [[nun]] worshipping the goddess [[Artemis]].\n\n[[Peter Quince]] and his fellow players [[Nick Bottom]], [[Francis Flute]], [[Robin Starveling]], [[Tom Snout]] and [[Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Snug]] plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, \"the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]]\". Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them on the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. Quince insists that Bottom can only play the role of Pyramus. Bottom would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of [[Hercules|Ercles]]. Bottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players [[Hanging|hanged]]. Snug remarks that he needs the Lion's part because he is \"slow of study\". Quince assures Snug that the role of the lion is \"nothing but roaring.\" Quince then ends the meeting telling his actors \"at the Duke's oak we meet\".\n\n[[File:Sir Joseph Noel Paton - The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|''The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania'' by [[Joseph Noel Paton]], 1849]]\nIn a parallel plot line, [[Oberon]], king of the fairies, and [[Titania]], his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian [[changeling]] to Oberon for use as his \"knight\" or \"henchman\", since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience. He calls upon Robin \"[[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]]\" Goodfellow, his \"shrewd and knavish sprite\", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called \"[[love-in-idleness]]\", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, \"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me.\"\n\nHermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of running away from Theseus. Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of finding Hermia. Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man. Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Helena, thinking Lysander is playing a trick on her, runs away with Lysander following her. When Hermia wakes up, she sees that Lysander is gone and goes out in the woods to find him. Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia, who thinks Demetrius killed Lysander, and is enraged. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, he sees Helena. Now, both men are in love with Helena. However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia finds Lysander and asks why he left her, but Lysander claims he never loved Hermia, just Helena. Hermia accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her while Helena believes Hermia joined the two men in mocking her. Hermia tries to attack Helena, but the two men protect Helena. Lysander, tired of Hermia's presence, insults her and tells her to leave. Lysander and Demetrius decide to seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater. The two women go their own separate ways, Helena hoping to reach Athens and Hermia chasing after the men to make sure Lysander doesn't get hurt or killed. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.\n\n[[File:My Mistress with a Monster is in Love.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Puck, Titania and Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream from Act III, Scene II by [[Charles Buchel]], 1905]]\nMeanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers (\"rude [[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]]\", as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's [[dwelling|bower]], for their rehearsal. Quince leads the actors in their rehearsal of the play. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a [[Donkey|jackass]]) transforms his head into that of a [[donkey]]. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him. She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the [[changeling]] boy. Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, returning his love to Hermia again, and claiming all will be well in the morning.\n\nThe fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They find the lovers still sleeping in the glade. They wake up the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers at first believe they are still in a dream and can't recall what has happened. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream. After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream \"past the wit of man\".\n\nAt Quince's house, he and his team of actors worry that Bottom has gone missing. Quince laments that Bottom is the only man who can take on the lead role of Pyramus. Bottom returns, and the actors get ready to put on \"Pyramus and Thisbe.\"\n\nIn Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform ''Pyramus and Thisbe.'' The performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After all the other characters leave, Puck \"restores amends\" and suggests that what the [[audience]] experienced might just be a dream.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Midsummer Night's Dream Henry Fuseli2.jpg|thumb|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' act IV, scene I. Engraving from the painting ''[[Titania and Bottom]]'' by [[Henry Fuseli]], published 1796]]\nIt is unknown exactly when ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written or first performed, but on the basis of topical references and an allusion to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Epithalamion (poem)|Epithalamion]]'', it is usually dated 1595 or early 1596. Some have theorised that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding (for example that of [[Elizabeth Carey, Lady Berkeley]]), while others suggest that it was written for the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to celebrate the [[Midsummer Day|feast day]] of [[John the Apostle|St. John]], but no  evidence exists to support this theory. In any case, it would have been performed at [[The Theatre]] and, later, [[Globe Theater|The Globe]]. Though it is not a translation or adaptation of an earlier work, various sources such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and [[Chaucer]]'s \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\" served as inspiration.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=lix}} According to John Twyning, the play's plot of four lovers undergoing a trial in the woods was intended as a \"riff\" on ''[[Der Busant]]'', a [[Middle High German]] poem.{{sfn|Twyning|2012|p=77}}\n\nAccording to Dorothea Kehler, the writing period can be placed between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had probably already completed ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and was still in contemplation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. The play belongs to the author's early-middle period, a time when Shakespeare devoted primary attention to the [[lyricism]] of his works.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=3}}\n\n==Date and text==\n[[File:First Quarto Printing of A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|left|The title page from the first quarto, printed in 1600]]\nThe play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] on 8 October 1600 by the bookseller [[Thomas Fisher (printer)|Thomas Fisher]], who published the [[first quarto]] edition later that year.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=xxi}} A [[second quarto]] was printed in 1619 by [[William Jaggard]], as part of his so-called [[False Folio]].{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=xxi}} The play next appeared in print in the [[First Folio]] of 1623. The title page of [[first quarto|Q1]] states that the play was \"sundry times publickely acted\" prior to 1600.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=lvii}} The first performance known with certainty occurred at Court on 1 January 1604.\n\n==Themes and motifs==\n===Lovers' bliss===\n\nIn [[Ancient Greece]], long before the creation of the Christian celebrations of [[Midsummer|St. John's Day]], the summer solstice was marked by [[Adonia]], a festival to mourn the death of [[Adonis]], the devoted mortal lover of the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. According to [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's Metamorphoses]], Aphrodite took the orphaned infant Adonis to the [[underworld]] to be raised by [[Persephone]]. He grew to be a beautiful young man, and when Aphrodite returned to retrieve him, Persephone did not want to let him go. Zeus settled the dispute by giving Adonis one-third of the year with Persephone, one-third of the year with Aphrodite, and the remaining third where he chose. Adonis chose to spend two-thirds of the year with his paramour, Aphrodite. He bled to death in his lover's arms after being gored by a boar. Mythology has various stories attributing the color of certain flowers to staining by the blood of Adonis or Aphrodite.\n\nThe story of Venus and Adonis was well known to the Elizabethans and inspired many works, including Shakespeare's own hugely popular narrative poem, [[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]], written while London's theaters were closed because of plague. It was published in 1593.<ref>[[Venus_and_Adonis_(Shakespeare_poem)]]</ref>\n\nThe wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta and the mistaken and waylaid lovers, Titania and Bottom, even the erstwhile acting troupe, model various aspects (and forms) of love.\n\n===Carnivalesque===\nBoth David Wiles of the [[University of London]] and [[Harold Bloom]] of [[Yale University]] have strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes of [[Carnivalesque]], [[Bacchanalia]], and [[Saturnalia]].{{sfn|Wiles|2008|pp=208\u201323}} Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: \"The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although we encounter ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, and part of the festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre in the months that followed became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration.\"  {{sfn|Wiles|2008|p=213}} Wiles argued in 1993 that the play was written to celebrate the Carey-Berkeley wedding. The date of the wedding was fixed to coincide with a conjunction of Venus and the new moon, highly propitious for conceiving an heir.<ref>Wiles 1993</ref>\n\n===Love===\n[[File:Simmons-Hermia and Lysander. A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|''Hermia and Lysander'' by [[John Simmons (painter)|John Simmons]] (1870)]]\n[[David Bevington]] argues that the play represents the dark side of love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her to fall in love with an ass.{{sfn|Bevington|1996|pp=24\u201335}} In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it.{{sfn|Bevington|1996|p=32}} Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.\n\n===Problem with time===\nThere is a dispute over the scenario of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that \"four happy days bring in another moon\".<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.I.2\u20133.</ref> The wood episode then takes place at a night of no moon, but Lysander asserts that there will be so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls.<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.I.208\u201313.</ref> Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight,<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.II.90\u20139.</ref> which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus's statement can also be interpreted to mean \"four days until the next month\". Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the moon is not seen due to its closeness to the sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a liminal \"dark of the moon\" period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta's opening lines exclaiming \"And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.\"; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon's return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title with [[May Day]], furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they \"observe The rite of May\".<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', IV.I.131\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Loss of individual identity===\n[[File:Edwin Landseer - Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin Landseer]], ''[[Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom]]'' (1848)]]\n\nMaurice Hunt, Chair of the English Department at [[Baylor University]], writes of the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality in the play that make possible \"that pleasing, narcotic dreaminess associated with the fairies of the play\".{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} By emphasising this theme, even in the setting of the play, Shakespeare prepares the reader's mind to accept the fantastic reality of the fairy world and its happenings. This also seems to be the axis around which the plot conflicts in the play occur. Hunt suggests that it is the breaking down of individual identities that leads to the central conflict in the story.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} It is the brawl between Oberon and Titania, based on a lack of recognition for the other in the relationship, that drives the rest of the drama in the story and makes it dangerous for any of the other lovers to come together due to the disturbance of Nature caused by a fairy dispute.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower's juice on Lysander's eyes instead of Demetrius'.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}}\n\nVictor Kiernan, a Marxist scholar and historian, writes that it is for the greater sake of love that this loss of identity takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: \"It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes.\"{{sfn|Kiernan|1993|p=212}} He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: \"It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships.\"{{sfn|Kiernan|1993|p=210}}\n\nThe aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes \"Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered.\"{{sfn|Marshall|1982}} In Marshall's opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare's opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that \"To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part.\"{{sfn|Marshall|1982}} He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. As the primary sense of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story's overall mood.{{sfn|Marshall|1982}}\n\n===Ambiguous sexuality===\n[[File:Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli 007.jpg|thumb|left|''The Awakening of the Fairy Queen Titania'']]\nIn his essay \"Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream\",'' Douglas E. Green explores possible interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds within the text of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay \"does not (seek to) rewrite ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as a gay play but rather explores some of its 'homoerotic significations'&nbsp;... moments of 'queer' disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy.\"{{sfn|Green|1998|p=370}}\n\nGreen does not consider Shakespeare to have been a \"sexual radical\", but that the play represented a \"topsy-turvy world\" or \"temporary holiday\" that mediates or negotiates the \"discontents of civilisation\", which while resolved neatly in the story's conclusion, do not resolve so neatly in real life.{{sfn|Green|1998|p=375}} Green writes that the \"sodomitical elements\", \"[[homoeroticism]]\", \"lesbianism\", and even \"compulsory heterosexuality\"\u2014the first hint of which may be Oberon's obsession with Titania's changeling ward\u2014in the story must be considered in the context of the \"culture of early modern England\" as a commentary on the \"aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order\".{{sfn|Green|1998|p=375}} Aspects of ambiguous sexuality and gender conflict in the story are also addressed in essays by Shirley Garner and William W.E. Slights albeit all the characters are played by males.{{sfn|Garner|1998|pp=129\u201330}}{{sfn|Slights|1988|p=261}}\n\n===Feminism===\n[[File:Edward Robert Hughes - Midsummer Eve (1908c).jpg|thumb|upright|''Midsummer Eve'' by [[Edward Robert Hughes]] c. 1908]]\nMale dominance is one thematic element found in the play. In ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Lysander and Hermia escape into the woods for a night where they do not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage is seen as the ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition.{{sfn|Howard|2003|p=414}} In ''The Imperial Votaress'', Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, \"The festive conclusion in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands.\"{{sfn|Montrose|2000|p=65}} He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection is drawn between flowers and sexuality. Montrose sees the juice employed by Oberon as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the \"sexual blood shed by 'virgins'\". While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman's power, blood as a result of a first sexual encounter represents man's power over women.{{sfn|Montrose|2000|pp=61\u201369}}\n\nThere are points in the play, however, when there is an absence of patriarchal control. In his book ''Power on Display'', Leonard Tennenhouse says the problem in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is the problem of \"authority gone archaic\".{{sfn|Tennenhouse|1986|p=73}} The Athenian law requiring a daughter to die if she does not do her father's will is outdated. Tennenhouse contrasts the patriarchal rule of Theseus in Athens with that of Oberon in the carnivalistic Faerie world. The disorder in the land of the fairies completely opposes the world of Athens. He states that during times of carnival and festival, male power is broken down. For example, what happens to the four lovers in the woods as well as Bottom's dream represents chaos that contrasts with Theseus' political order. However, Theseus does not punish the lovers for their disobedience. According to Tennenhouse, by forgiving the lovers, he has made a distinction between the law of the patriarch (Egeus) and that of the monarch (Theseus), creating two different voices of authority. This  can be compared to the time of [[Elizabeth I]], in which monarchs were seen as having two bodies: the body natural and the body politic. Tennenhouse says that Elizabeth's succession itself represented both the voice of a patriarch and the voice of a monarch: (1) her father's will, which stated that the crown should pass to her and (2) the fact that she was the daughter of a king.{{sfn|Tennenhouse|1986|Pp=74\u201376}}\n\n==Criticism and interpretation==\n===Critical history===\n====17th century====\n[[File:Samuel Pepys.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samuel Pepys]], who wrote the oldest known comments on the play, found ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' to be \"the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}]]\nDorothea Kehler has attempted to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism that she found was a 1662 entry in the diary of [[Samuel Pepys]]. He found the play to be \"the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} He did, however, admit that it had \"some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\nThe next critic known to comment on the play was [[John Dryden]], writing in 1677. He was preoccupied with the question of whether [[Fairy|fairies]] should be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive from [[popular belief]]. And fairies are of this sort, as are [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pigmies]] and the extraordinary effects of [[Magic (paranormal)|magick]]. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays: ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', and [[Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson's]] ''[[The Masque of Queens|Masque of Witches]]''.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\n====18th century====\n[[Charles Gildon]] in the early 18th century recommended this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works of [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]], and that he could read them in the original [[Latin]] and not in later translations.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\n[[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]], writing in the 1770s, also recommended this play. He felt the depiction of the supernatural was among Shakespeare's strengths, not weaknesses. He especially praised the poetry and wit of the fairies, and the quality of the verse involved.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} His contemporary [[Francis Gentleman]], an admirer of Shakespeare, was much less appreciative of this play. He felt that the poetry, the characterisation, and the originality of the play were its strengths, but that its major weaknesses were a \"puerile\" plot and that it consists of an odd mixture of incidents. The connection of the incidents to each other seemed rather forced to Gentleman.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n[[Edmond Malone]], a Shakespearean scholar and critic of the late 18th century, found another supposed flaw in this particular play, its lack of a proper [[decorum]]. He found that the \"more exalted characters\" (the aristocrats of Athens) are subservient to the interests of those beneath them. In other words, the lower-class characters play larger roles than their betters and overshadow them. He found this to be a grave error of the writer. Malone thought that this play had to be an early and immature work of Shakespeare and, by implication, that an older writer would know better. Malone's main argument seems to derive from the [[Class discrimination|classism]] of his era. He assumes that the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] had to receive more attention in the narrative and to be more important, more distinguished, and better than the lower class.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}}\n\n====19th century====\n[[Image:William Hazlitt self-portrait (1802).jpg|thumb|right|[[William Hazlitt]] preferred reading ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' over watching it acted on stage.]]\nAccording to Kehler, significant 19th-century criticism began in 1808 with [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]]. Schlegel perceived unity in the multiple plot lines. He noted that the donkey's head is not a random transformation, but reflects Bottom's true nature. He identified the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe as a [[burlesque]] of the Athenian lovers.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} In 1817, [[William Hazlitt]] found the play to be better as a written work than a staged production. He found the work to be \"a delightful fiction\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} but when staged, it is reduced to a dull [[pantomime]]. He concluded that poetry and the stage do not fit together.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} Kehler finds the comment to be more of an indication of the quality of the theatrical productions available to Hazlitt, rather than a true indication of the play's supposed unsuitability to the stage. She notes that prior to the 1840s, all stage productions of this play were adaptations unfaithful to the original text.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}}\n\nIn 1811\u20131812, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] made two points of criticism about this play. The first was that the entire play should be seen as a [[dream]]. Second, that Helena is guilty of \"ungrateful treachery\" to Hermia. He thought that this was a reflection of the lack of [[principle]]s in women, who are more likely to follow their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moral [[evil]], though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introduce [[gender]] issues to the analysis of this play. Kehler dismisses his views on Helena as indications of Coleridge's own [[misogyny]], rather than genuine reflections of Helena's morality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n[[File:Augustins - La Folie de Titania - Paul Jean Gervais 1897 2004 1 188.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Maginn]] thought Bottom a lucky man and was particularly amused that he treats Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, \"as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}]]\nIn 1837, [[William Maginn]] produced essays on the play. He turned his attention to Theseus' speech about \"the lunatic, the lover, and the poet\"{{efn|Theseus' \"The lunatic, the lover, and the poet\" speech is in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' V.I.2\u201322.<ref>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' V.I.2\u201322.</ref>}} and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whom [[Fortuna|Fortune]] showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the [[Titania|fairy queen]]: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that \"Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}} Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the \"caprices\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}} of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}\n\nIn 1839, the philosopher [[Hermann Ulrici]] wrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views of [[Platonism]]. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream, suggesting influence from [[Plato]] and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of [[parody]] about class differences.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}\n\n[[James Halliwell-Phillipps]], writing in the 1840s, found that there were many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} \n\nIn 1849, [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] also wrote about the play and its apparent lack of proper [[social stratification]]. He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare's maturity as a playwright, and that its \"Thesean harmony\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be \"subtle and ethereal\", and standing above [[literary criticism]] and its reductive reasoning.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n[[File:Lysander declaring his passion to Helena (Smirke, c. 1820-1825).jpg|thumb|right|[[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] thought Hermia lacking in [[filial piety]] and devoid of conscience for running away with Lysander, himself not a shining beacon of virtue (here seen wooing Helena).{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}]]\nAlso in 1849, [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] wrote extensively about the play. He denied the theory that this play should be seen as a dream. He argued that it should be seen as an ethical construct and an [[allegory]]. He thought that it was an allegorical depiction of the errors of sensual love, which is likened to a dream. In his view, Hermia lacks in [[Filial piety|filial obedience]] and acts as if devoid of conscience when she runs away with Lysander. Lysander is also guilty for disobeying and mocking his prospective father-in-law. Pyramus and Thisbe also lack in filial obedience, since they \"woo by moonlight\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} behind their parents' backs. The fairies, in his view, should be seen as \"personified dream gods\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} They represent the caprices of superficial love, and they lack in intellect, feeling, and ethics.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}\n\nGervinus also wrote on where the [[fairyland]] of the play is located. Not in [[Attica]], but in the [[Indies]]. His views on the Indies seem to Kehler to be influenced by [[Orientalism]]. He speaks of the Indies as scented with the [[odour|aroma]] of flowers and as the place where mortals live in the state of a half-dream. Gervinus denies and devalues the loyalty of Titania to her friend. He views this supposed friendship as not grounded in spiritual association. Titania merely \"delight in her beauty, her 'swimming gait,' and her powers of imitation\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} Gervinus further views Titania as an immoral character for not trying to reconcile with her husband. In her resentment, Titania seeks separation from him, which Gervinus blames her for.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}\n\nGervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations. He described them as homely creatures with \"hard hands and thick heads\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} They are, in his view, ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward. They are not real artists. Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus, who he thinks represents the intellectual man. Like several of his predecessors, Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}\n\n[[File:Charles Cowden Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Cowden Clarke]] appreciated the [[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]], and in particular found [[Nick Bottom]] conceited but good-natured and imaginative.]]\nIn 1863, [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar [[Mary Cowden Clarke]]. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nIn 1872, Henry N. Hudson, an American clergyman and editor of Shakespeare, also wrote comments on this play. Kehler pays little attention to his writings, as they were largely derivative of previous works. She notes, however, that Hudson too believed that the play should be viewed as a dream. He cited the lightness of the characterisation as supporting of his view.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} In 1881, [[Edward Dowden]] argued that Theseus and his reflections on art are central to the play. He also argued that Theseus was one of the \"heroic men of action\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} so central to Shakespeare's theatrical works.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}}\n\n[[Image:Horace Howard Furness.jpg|thumb|left|[[Horace Howard Furness]] defended ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' from claims of inconsistency, and felt this did not detract from the quality of the play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}]]\nBoth [[Horace Howard Furness]] and Henry Austin Clapp were more concerned with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} Furness, defending the play in 1895, felt that the apparent inconsistency did not detract from the play's quality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} \n\nIn 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a [[dialectic]], either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one. For failing to live in peace with Oberon and her kind, Titania is sentenced to fall in love with a human. And this human, unlike Oberon is a \"horrid brute\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}}\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, [[Georg Brandes]] (1895\u20136) and [[Frederick S. Boas]] (1896) were the last major additions to ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' criticism.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} Brandes' approach to anticipates later [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychological readings]], seeing Oberon's magic as symbolic and \"typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the \"domain of the unconscious\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, \"essentially English and Elizabethan\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to \"concentrate the four lovers on a single spot\";{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} and the ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' play-within-the-play a parody of a prominent ''[[topos]]'' of contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: \"This is recognizably modern criticism.\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}}\n\n====20th century====\nThe 20th century brought new insights into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the [[artisan]]s. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working in this play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Also in 1961, [[Frank Kermode]] wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of [[Macrobius]], [[Apuleius]], and [[Giordano Bruno]]. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] by [[Paul the Apostle]], dealing with divine love.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}}{{efn|Specifically, Bottom alludes to I Corinthians 2:9.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}}}}\n\nIn 1964, R.W. Dent argued against theories that the exemplary model of love in the play is the rational love of Theseus and Hippolyta. He argued that in this work, love is inexplicable. It is the offspring of imagination, not reason. However the exemplary love of the play is one of an imagination controlled and restrained, and avoids the excesses of \"dotage\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Genuine love is contrasted with the [[unrequited love]] (and dotage) of Demetrius for Hermia, and with the supposed love (and dotage) of Titania for an unworthy object.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nDent also denied the rationality and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers that this is the character of [[Theseus]] from [[Greek mythology]], a creation himself of \"antique fable\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He can't tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nAlso in 1964, [[Jan Kott]] offered his own views on the play. He viewed as main themes of the play violence and \"unrepressed animalistic sexuality\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, their love interests are exchangeable and [[Objectification|objectified]]. The [[changeling]] that Oberon desires is his new \"sexual toy\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, are [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed to talk about it because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} Kott's views were controversial and contemporary critics wrote, either in favour of or against Kott's views, but few ignored them.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}}\n\nIn 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is a symbol of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was redeemed through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the \"terrifying power\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} of the fairies and argued that they control the play's events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethically [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] characters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play's audience can have no singular answer or meaning.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=30\u20131}}\n\nIn 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=31}}\n\nIn 1970, R.A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The play uses the principle of ''[[Enantiosis|discordia concors]]'' in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has to give up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=31}}\n\nIn 1971, James L. Calderwood offered a new view on the role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts of [[illusion]]. Oberon, in his view, is the interior dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nAlso in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play's actual theme is unity. The poet's imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and the writer is addressing the spectator's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare's allusion to the \"eternal truths\"{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}} of [[Platonism]] and Christianity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}}\n\nAlso writing in 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely new view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is actually a [[Self-destructive behaviour|self-destructive]] expression of [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At the same time it protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own [[egotism]] protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}}\n\nIn 1971, Neil Taylor argued that there was a double time-scheme in the play, making it seem to last a minimum of four nights but to also be timeless.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\nIn 1972, Ralph Berry argued that Shakespeare was chiefly concerned with [[epistemology]] in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}} Also in 1972, [[Thomas McFarland]] argued that the play is dominated by a mood of happiness and that it is one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1974, [[Marjorie Garber]] argued that metamorphosis is both the major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses on the story of the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}}\n\nIn 1975, Ronald F. Miller expresses his view that the play is a study in the epistemology of imagination. He focused on the role of the fairies, who have a mysterious aura of evanescence and ambiguity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} Also in 1975, [[David Bevington]] offered his own reading of the play. He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may be [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is \"unknowable and incomprehensible\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}}\n\nIn 1977, [[Anne Paolucci]] argued that the play lasts five days.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}\n\nIn 1979, M. E. Lamb suggested that the play may have borrowed an aspect of the ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the [[Labyrinth]] of the [[Minotaur]]. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]] the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes [[Ariadne|Ariadne's]] thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, [[Daedalus]]. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAlso in 1979, Harold F. Brooks agreed that the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its culmination in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}} In 1980, Florence Falk offered a view of the play based on theories of [[cultural anthropology]]. She argued that the play is about traditional [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to the ''[[communitas]]'' of the woods. The woods serve here as the ''communitas'', a temporary aggregate for persons whose asocial desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the asocial can be contained. Falk identified this ''communitas'' with the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is \"''societas''\", the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism of ''communitas'' and structure.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}}\n\nAlso in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. offered a Christian view of the play. The experience of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them \"a new humility, a healthy sense of folly\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}} They realise that there are things that are true despite the fact that they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Puck (29391431162).jpg|thumb|left|Alex Aronson considered Puck a representation of the [[unconscious mind]] and a contrast to Theseus as a representation of the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]].{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}}]]\nSome of the interpretations of the play have been based on [[psychology]] and its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and Puck represents the [[unconscious mind]]. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as a [[trickster]], while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept of [[fertility]]. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers' sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}} In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers can not simply return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their \"authentic sexual selves\".{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}} In 1979, [[Norman N. Holland]] applied [[psychoanalytic literary criticism]] to the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia as if it was a real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia's sexual development. Her search for options is her [[Defence mechanisms|defence mechanism]]. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}}\n\nIn 1981, Mordecai Marcus argued for a new meaning of [[Eros]] (Love) and [[Thanatos]] (Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare suggests that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release of [[sexual tension]]. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love is connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=40\u20131}}\n\nIn 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely argued that this play has a therapeutic value. Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, releases them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony. [[Patriarchy]] itself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania's loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom as a metaphor for basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}} In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters' fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}}\n\nIn 1991, Barbara Freedman argued that the play justifies the ideological formation of [[absolute monarchy]], and makes visible for examination the maintenance process of [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] order.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}}\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Second Folio Printing of A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|The first page printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the years of the [[Puritan]] [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] when the theatres were closed (1642\u20131660), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a [[droll]]. Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama. When the theatres re-opened in 1660, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. [[Samuel Pepys]] saw it on 29&nbsp;September 1662 and thought it \"''the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw&nbsp;...''\"{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=142\u201343, 316\u201317}}\n\nAfter the Jacobean / Caroline era, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was never performed in its entirety until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like [[Henry Purcell]]'s musical masque/play [[The Fairy-Queen|The Fairy Queen]] (1692), which had a successful run at the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]], but was not revived. [[Richard Leveridge]] turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in 1716. [[John Frederick Lampe]] elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of ''Love in a Forest'', his 1723 adaptation of ''[[As You Like It]]''. In 1755, [[David Garrick]] did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called ''The Fairies.'' Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=255, 271, 278, 316\u201317, 410}}\n\n===The Victorian stage===\nIn 1840, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] at [[Covent Garden]] returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, adding musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] would always be played by women.{{sfn|RSC|n.d.}}\n\nAfter the success of Madame Vestris' production, [[19th-century theatre]] continued to stage the ''Dream'' as a spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred.

In 1842, partly because of the fame of the overture, and partly because his employer [[Frederick William&nbsp;IV of Prussia|King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]] liked the [[incidental music]] that Mendelssohn had written for other plays that had been staged at the palace in German translation, Mendelssohn was commissioned to write incidental music for a production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' that was to be staged in 1843 in [[Potsdam]]. He incorporated the existing Overture into the incidental music, which was used in most stage versions through the 19th century. The best known of the pieces from the incidental music is the famous ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]'', frequently used as a [[Recessional hymn|recessional]] in weddings.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe choreographer [[Marius Petipa]], more famous for his collaborations with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] (on the ballets ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'') made another ballet adaptation for the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] with additional music and adaptations to Mendelssohn's score by [[Ludwig Minkus|L\u00e9on Minkus]]. The revival premiered 14 July 1876. English choreographer [[Frederick Ashton]] also created a 40-minute ballet version of the play, retitled to ''The Dream''. [[George Balanchine]] was another to create a ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet)|Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' ballet based on the play, using Mendelssohn's music.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1939 [[Carl Orff]] also wrote incidental music for a German version of the play, ''Ein Sommernachtstraum'' (performed in 1939). Since Mendelssohn's parents were Jews who converted to Lutheranism, his music had been banned by the Nazi regime, and the Nazi cultural officials put out a call for new music for the play: Orff was one of the musicians who responded.
