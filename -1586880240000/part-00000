The first Provident Fund Act passed in 1925 for regulating the provident funds of some private concerns was limited in scope.  In 1929 the Royal Commission on Labour stressed the need for formulating schemes for instituting provident funds for industrial workers. In the Indian Labour Conference held in 1948, it was generally agreed that the introduction of a statutory provident fund scheme for industrial workers might be undertaken. To test such a scheme in a  restricted field the  Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme was launched in 1948. The success of this Scheme led to the demand for its expansion to other industries.\n\nAccordingly, close of the year 1951 witnessed the promulgation of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance.  The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 was replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The  Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in  its entirety by 1 November 1952.\n\n==Provident Fund==\nThe Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 came into effect on 4 March 1952. Six industries namely 1.Cement 2. Cigarettes 3.Electrical, mechanical or general engineering products 4.Iron and Steel 5. Paper  6. Textiles (made wholly or in part of cotton, wool or jute or silk, whether natural or artificial) came under implementation of the Act w.e.f 1, November,1952. The organisation is administered by a Central Board of Trustees, composed of representatives of the Government of India, State governments, Employers and Employees. The board is chaired by the Union Labour Minister of India. The Chief Executive of the EPFO, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, reports to the Union Labour Minister through the Secretary of Labour and Employment in the ministry. The headquarters of the organisation is in [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of India]] under \"Directive Principles of State Policy\" provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic capacity make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old-age, sickness & disablement and undeserved want. The EPF & MP Act, 1952 was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and came into force with effect from 4 March 1952 as part of a series of legislative interventions  made in this direction. Presently, the following three schemes are in operation under the Act:\n#  Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952\n#  Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976\n#  Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 (replacing the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971)\n\nRetirement fund body EPFO on 21 February 2018 lowered the rate of interest on employees provident fund to 8.55% for 2017-18,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|title=EPFO Declares 8.55% interest Rate for 2017-18|date=21 February 2018|work=Naya India|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050747/https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|archive-date=23 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> from 8.65%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/epfo-cuts-interest-rate-to-8-55-for-2017-18-from-8-65-for-2016-17/articleshow/63016770.cms|title=EPFO cuts interest rate to 8.55% for 2017-18 from 8.65% for 2016-17|date=22 February 2018|work=The Economic Times}}</ref> in the previous fiscal.\n\n==Structure==\nThe EPFO has the dual role of being the enforcement agency to oversee the implementation of the EPF & MP Act and as a service provider for the covered beneficiaries throughout the country.\n\nThe Act is administered by Central Board of Trustees, EPF a Statutory Board constituted by the Central Government under Section 5A of the Act. The CBT, as the Board is informally called, consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, 5 Central Government Representatives, 15 State Government Representatives, 10 Employees' Representatives, 10 Employers' Representatives with Central P.F Commissioner and the Member Secretary to the Board. The Executive Committee of the CBT is constituted from among the members of the CBT to assist the Central Board in discharge of its function related to Administrative matters.\n\nThe officials of the organization in the Cadre of Commissioners are appointed by the Central Board under Section 5D for efficient administration of the Act and Schemes. To this end, the Commissioners of the Organization are vested with vast powers under the statute conferring quasi-judicial authority for assessment of financial liability on the employer, search and seizure of records, levy of damages, attachment and auction of a defaulter's property, prosecution and arrest and detention of defaulters in civil prison etc.\n\nAdministratively, the organization is divided into zones which are headed by an Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner. At present, there are 10 Zones across the country. Further below, the states have either one or more than one Regional Offices headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (RPFC) (Grade I) which are again sub- divided into Sub-Regions headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (Grade II). To assist them are Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners looking after the enforcement of the Act and Schemes. Many districts in the country have district offices where an assistant provident fund commissioner is stationed for implementation of the scheme and attend to grievances.\n\nThe total manpower of the EPFO is at present more than 20000 including all levels. The Commissioner cadre numbering 815 are recruited directly, competitively, through the Union Public Service Commission of India as well as through promotion from lower ranks. Subordinate Officers (Enforcement Officers/Accounts Officers) are also recruited directly in addition to promotion from the staff cadre of social security assistants.\n\n==Universal Account Number (UAN)==\n'''UAN is Universal Account Number'''. The UAN is a 12-digit  number allotted to employee who is contributing to EPF will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. For example, 111222333444. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it.\n\nThe Major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, [[Short Message Service|SMS]] Services on each deposit of contribution and Online [[Know your customer|KYC]] Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number. One can transfer balance from one EPF to his/her another EPF account with the help of UAN.\n\nThere are new UAN portal start to check your EPF balance and nowadays all the details like how to check UAN status,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=uan Registration & activation status procedure|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> download UAN EPF passbook,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epf-balance-and-epfo-balance/|title=3+ ways to know\u00a0your EPF Balance with uan & mobile|author=|date=30 September 2018|website=epfuanlogin.com}}</ref> check EPF balance,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/transfer-pf-amount/|title=pf transfer withdrawal process -TDS|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> provident fund claim and many more facility provided by new UAN portal.\n\nEPFO has now started to provide the refund of Administrative charges if all the KYC details are updated for all employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=EPFO UAN Member portal Login registration features passbook etc - UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login|author=|date=|website=UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login}}</ref> This incentive program is announced for the Year 2016-2017.\n\nThe member who is unable to withdraw PF for any reason can withdraw without consent of employer.

The first Provident Fund Act passed in 1925 for regulating the provident funds of some private concerns was limited in scope.  In 1929 the Royal Commission on Labour stressed the need for formulating schemes for instituting provident funds for industrial workers. In the Indian Labour Conference held in 1948, it was generally agreed that the introduction of a statutory provident fund scheme for industrial workers might be undertaken. To test such a scheme in a  restricted field the  Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme was launched in 1948. The success of this Scheme led to the demand for its expansion to other industries.\n\nAccordingly, close of the year 1951 witnessed the promulgation of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance.  The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 was replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The  Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in  its entirety by 1 November 1952.\n\n==Provident Fund==\nThe Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 came into effect on 4 March 1952. Six industries namely 1.Cement 2. Cigarettes 3.Electrical, mechanical or general engineering products 4.Iron and Steel 5. Paper  6. Textiles (made wholly or in part of cotton, wool or jute or silk, whether natural or artificial) came under implementation of the Act w.e.f 1, November,1952. The organisation is administered by a Central Board of Trustees, composed of representatives of the Government of India, State governments, Employers and Employees. The board is chaired by the Union Labour Minister of India. The Chief Executive of the EPFO, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, reports to the Union Labour Minister through the Secretary of Labour and Employment in the ministry. The headquarters of the organisation is in [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of India]] under \"Directive Principles of State Policy\" provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic capacity make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old-age, sickness & disablement and undeserved want. The EPF & MP Act, 1952 was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and came into force with effect from 4 March 1952 as part of a series of legislative interventions  made in this direction. Presently, the following three schemes are in operation under the Act:\n#  Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952\n#  Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976\n#  Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 (replacing the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971)\n\nRetirement fund body EPFO on 21 February 2018 lowered the rate of interest on employees provident fund to 8.55% for 2017-18,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|title=EPFO Declares 8.55% interest Rate for 2017-18|date=21 February 2018|work=Naya India|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050747/https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|archive-date=23 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> from 8.65%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/epfo-cuts-interest-rate-to-8-55-for-2017-18-from-8-65-for-2016-17/articleshow/63016770.cms|title=EPFO cuts interest rate to 8.55% for 2017-18 from 8.65% for 2016-17|date=22 February 2018|work=The Economic Times}}</ref> in the previous fiscal.\n\n==Structure==\nThe EPFO has the dual role of being the enforcement agency to oversee the implementation of the EPF & MP Act and as a service provider for the covered beneficiaries throughout the country.\n\nThe Act is administered by Central Board of Trustees, EPF a Statutory Board constituted by the Central Government under Section 5A of the Act. The CBT, as the Board is informally called, consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, 5 Central Government Representatives, 15 State Government Representatives, 10 Employees' Representatives, 10 Employers' Representatives with Central P.F Commissioner and the Member Secretary to the Board. The Executive Committee of the CBT is constituted from among the members of the CBT to assist the Central Board in discharge of its function related to Administrative matters.\n\nThe officials of the organization in the Cadre of Commissioners are appointed by the Central Board under Section 5D for efficient administration of the Act and Schemes. To this end, the Commissioners of the Organization are vested with vast powers under the statute conferring quasi-judicial authority for assessment of financial liability on the employer, search and seizure of records, levy of damages, attachment and auction of a defaulter's property, prosecution and arrest and detention of defaulters in civil prison etc.\n\nAdministratively, the organization is divided into zones which are headed by an Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner. At present, there are 10 Zones across the country. Further below, the states have either one or more than one Regional Offices headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (RPFC) (Grade I) which are again sub- divided into Sub-Regions headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (Grade II). To assist them are Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners looking after the enforcement of the Act and Schemes. Many districts in the country have district offices where an assistant provident fund commissioner is stationed for implementation of the scheme and attend to grievances.\n\nThe total manpower of the EPFO is at present more than 20000 including all levels. The Commissioner cadre numbering 815 are recruited directly, competitively, through the Union Public Service Commission of India as well as through promotion from lower ranks. Subordinate Officers (Enforcement Officers/Accounts Officers) are also recruited directly in addition to promotion from the staff cadre of social security assistants.\n\n==Universal Account Number (UAN)==\n'''UAN is Universal Account Number'''. The UAN is a 12-digit  number allotted to employee who is contributing to EPF will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. For example, 111222333444. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it.\n\nThe Major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, [[Short Message Service|SMS]] Services on each deposit of contribution and Online [[Know your customer|KYC]] Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number.\n\nThere are new UAN portal start to check your EPF balance and nowadays all the details like how to check UAN status,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=uan Registration & activation status procedure|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> download UAN EPF passbook,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epf-balance-and-epfo-balance/|title=3+ ways to know\u00a0your EPF Balance with uan & mobile|author=|date=30 September 2018|website=epfuanlogin.com}}</ref> check EPF balance,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/transfer-pf-amount/|title=pf transfer withdrawal process -TDS|author=|date=30 April 2018|website=epfuanlogin}}</ref> provident fund claim and many more facility provided by new UAN portal.\n\nEPFO has now started to provide the refund of Administrative charges if all the KYC details are updated for all employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epfuanlogin.com/epfo-uan-login/|title=EPFO UAN Member portal Login registration features passbook etc - UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login|author=|date=|website=UAN Login Unified Portal UAN Member portal login}}</ref> This incentive program is announced for the Year 2016-2017.\n\nThe member who is unable to withdraw PF for any reason can withdraw without consent of employer.

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of yugas is traditionally believed to be a 4,32,000 year long cycle. In modern times,a shorter cycle is written as 24,000 years by another author is more commonly accepted as 25,772 years because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system {{Original research|date=February 2020}}. However, the traditional timescale is widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga.

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of yugas is traditionally believed to be a 4,32,000 year long cycle. In modern times,a shorter cycle is written as 24,000 years by another author is more commonly accepted as 25,772 years because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system {{Original research|date=February 2020}}.

He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />\n\nHe was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. \n\nActive in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il.

His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past.

''The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: versions of Wilde during the last 100 years'' 2002</ref> A dandy could be a [[self-made man]] who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from a [[middle-class]] background, especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nPrevious manifestations of the ''petit-ma\u00eetre'' (French for \"small master\") and the [[Muscadin]] have been noted by John C. Prevost,<ref>''Le Dandysme en France (1817\u20131839)'' (Geneva and Paris) 1957.</ref> but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in [[London]] and in [[Paris]]. The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.\n\n[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later \"metaphysical\" phase of dandyism,<ref>See Prevost 1957.</ref> as one who elevates [[\u00e6sthetics]] to a living religion,<ref>Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], \"The Painter of Modern Life\".</ref> that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: \"Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]\" and \"These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind.\"\n\nThe linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.<ref>Aileen Ribeiro, \"On Englishness in dress\" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.</ref> Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling effect of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of \"the perfect gentleman\" or \"the autonomous aristocrat\". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the \"successfully marketed lives\" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].<ref>Schmid 2002.</ref> [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;<ref>Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading \"Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation\".</ref> similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing (\"[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]\") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American citizen-colonist's means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a \"dandy\" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee \"Yankee Doodle\"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].</ref> A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,<ref>{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a.

The original, full form of 'dandy' may have been ''jack-a-dandy''.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911</ref> It was a [[vogue word]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In that contemporary slang, a \"dandy\" was differentiated from a \"[[fop]]\" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning \"fine\" or \"great\"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.<ref>See, for example, the ''Dandyism'' blog by Christian Chensvold, continually since 2004, but with a published record on the subject since the mid-1990s. http://www.dandyism.net</ref>\n\n== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==\n[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]\nThe model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummell]] (1778\u20131840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].  Brummell was not from an aristocratic background; indeed, his greatness was \"based on nothing at all,\" as [[Jules Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d'Aurevilly|J.A. Barbey d'Aurevilly]] observed in 1845.<ref>Barbey d'Aurevilly, \"Du dandisme et de George Brummell,\" (published 1845, collected in ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' 1925:87\u201392).</ref> Never unpowdered or unperfumed, immaculately bathed and shaved, and dressed in a plain dark blue coat,<ref>\"In Regency England, Brummel's fashionable simplicity constituted in fact a criticism of the exuberant French fashions of the eighteenth century\" (Schmid 2002:83),</ref> he was always perfectly brushed, perfectly fitted, showing much perfectly starched linen, all freshly laundered, and composed with an elaborately knotted [[cravat]]. From the mid-1790s, Beau Brummell was the early incarnation of \"the celebrity\", a man chiefly famous for ''being'' famous.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=Ian |title=Beau Brummell: The Ultimate Man of Style |date=2006 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=9780743270892 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/beaubrummellulti00kell }}</ref>\n\nBy the time [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|taxed hair powder]] in 1795 to help pay for the war against France and to discourage the use of flour (which had recently increased in both rarity and price, owing to bad harvests) in such a frivolous product, Brummell had already abandoned wearing a wig, and had his hair cut in the Roman fashion, \"\u00e0 la Brutus\". Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark \"[[Trousers|pantaloons]],\" which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], aged 61.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\nMen of more notable accomplishments than Beau Brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose: [[Lord Byron]] occasionally dressed the part, helping reintroduce the frilled, lace-cuffed and lace-collared \"[[poet shirt]]\". In that spirit, he had his portrait painted in Albanian costume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/byron-portrait|title=Portrait of Lord Byron in Albanian Dress, 1813|website=The British Library|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent dandy of the period was [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel d'Orsay]], the Count d'Orsay, who had been friends with Byron and who moved in the highest social circles of London.\n\nIn 1836 [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote: <blockquote>A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes. Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...<ref>[[Thomas Carlyle]], \"The Dandiacal Body\", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements\u2014\"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on. It was an image of a well-dressed man who, while taking infinite pains about his appearance, affected indifference to it. This refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male Englishness.\"<ref>Ribeira 2002:21.</ref>\n\n== Dandyism in France ==\n[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joachim Murat]], the French [[King of Naples]], was dubbed the \"Dandy King\" because of his highly groomed appearance.<ref>{{cite book|author=William R.

His habits of dress and fashion were much imitated, especially in France, where, in a curious development, they became the rage, especially in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] quarters. There, dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms: self-created men of consciously designed personality, radically breaking with past traditions. With elaborate dress and idle, [[decadence|decadent]] styles of life, French bohemian dandies sought to convey [[contempt]] for and superiority to bourgeois society. In the latter 19th century, this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in French literature.<ref>Roman Meinhold, trans.

But it is an aesthetic of negation. \"To live and die before a mirror\": that according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance... The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection.

Prevost,<ref>''Le Dandysme en France (1817\u20131839)'' (Geneva and Paris) 1957.</ref> but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in [[London]] and in [[Paris]]. The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.\n\n[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later \"metaphysical\" phase of dandyism,<ref>See Prevost 1957.</ref> as one who elevates [[\u00e6sthetics]] to a living religion,<ref>Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], \"The Painter of Modern Life\".</ref> that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: \"Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]\" and \"These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind.\"\n\nThe linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.<ref>Aileen Ribeiro, \"On Englishness in dress\" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.</ref> Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling effect of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of \"the perfect gentleman\" or \"the autonomous aristocrat\". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the \"successfully marketed lives\" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].<ref>Schmid 2002.</ref> [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;<ref>Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading \"Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation\".</ref> similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing (\"[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]\") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American citizen-colonist's means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a \"dandy\" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee \"Yankee Doodle\"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].</ref> A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,<ref>{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a.

In that contemporary slang, a \"dandy\" was differentiated from a \"[[fop]]\" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning \"fine\" or \"great\"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.<ref>See, for example, the ''Dandyism'' blog by Christian Chensvold, continually since 2004, but with a published record on the subject since the mid-1990s. http://www.dandyism.net</ref>\n\n== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==\n[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]\nThe model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummell]] (1778\u20131840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].  Brummell was not from an aristocratic background; indeed, his greatness was \"based on nothing at all,\" as [[Jules Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d'Aurevilly|J.A. Barbey d'Aurevilly]] observed in 1845.<ref>Barbey d'Aurevilly, \"Du dandisme et de George Brummell,\" (published 1845, collected in ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' 1925:87\u201392).</ref> Never unpowdered or unperfumed, immaculately bathed and shaved, and dressed in a plain dark blue coat,<ref>\"In Regency England, Brummel's fashionable simplicity constituted in fact a criticism of the exuberant French fashions of the eighteenth century\" (Schmid 2002:83),</ref> he was always perfectly brushed, perfectly fitted, showing much perfectly starched linen, all freshly laundered, and composed with an elaborately knotted [[cravat]].

Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark \"[[Trousers|pantaloons]],\" which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], aged 61.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

In that spirit, he had his portrait painted in Albanian costume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/byron-portrait|title=Portrait of Lord Byron in Albanian Dress, 1813|website=The British Library|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent dandy of the period was [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel d'Orsay]], the Count d'Orsay, who had been friends with Byron and who moved in the highest social circles of London.\n\nIn 1836 [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote: <blockquote>A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes. Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...<ref>[[Thomas Carlyle]], \"The Dandiacal Body\", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements\u2014\"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on.

While in England and France individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners, the Spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes, called [[majos]]. They were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern Frenchified \"[[afrancesados]]\", as for their cheeky arrogant attitude.\nSome famous dandies in later times were amongst other the [[Duke of Osuna]], Mariano Tellez-Gir\u00f3n, artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and poet [[Luis Cernuda|Lu\u00eds Cernuda]].\n\n== Later thought ==\n[[Albert Camus]] said in ''[[The Rebel (book)|L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9]]'' (1951) that: <blockquote>The dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means. But it is an aesthetic of negation. \"To live and die before a mirror\": that according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance... The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live it.<ref>{{cite book|first=Albert|last=Camus|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt]]|date=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307827838|page=51|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_3yQrhdxwUC&pg=PA51|accessdate=11 October 2014|chapter=II Metaphysical Rebellion}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jean Baudrillard]] said that dandyism is \"an aesthetic form of nihilism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xviii-on-nihilism/ |title=Jean Baudrillard \u2013 Simulacra and Simulations \u2013 XVIII.

Middle English dictionaries note ''quaintrelle'' as a beautifully dressed woman (or overly dressed), but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm.  The notion of a quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is a modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots.\n\nFemale dandies did overlap with male dandies for a brief period during the early 19th century when ''dandy'' had a derisive definition of \"fop\" or \"over-the-top fellow\"; the female equivalents were ''dandyess'' or ''dandizette''.<ref name=\"Brooks\"/> Charles Dickens, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=VvFIAAAAcAAJ&dq=charles%20dickens%20dandies%20and%20dandizettes&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q=dandies%20and%20dandizettes&f=false ''All the Year Around'' (1869)] comments, \"The dandies and dandizettes of 1819\u201320 must have been a strange race. \"Dandizette\" was a term applied to the feminine devotees to dress, and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandies.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvFIAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189|title=All the Year Round: A Weekly Journal|date=1869|publisher=Chapman & Hall|language=en}}</ref> In 1819, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HopAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Charms of Dandyism'' in three volumes], was published by Olivia Moreland, Chief of the Female Dandies; most likely one of many pseudonyms used by Thomas Ashe. Olivia Moreland may have existed, as Ashe did write several novels about living persons. Throughout the novel, dandyism is associated with \"living in style\".  Later, as the word ''dandy'' evolved to denote refinement, it became applied solely to men.  ''Popular Culture and Performance in the Victorian City'' (2003) notes this evolution in the latter 19th century: \"...or ''dandizette'', although the term was increasingly reserved for men.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Dandy (song)|Dandy]] and [[Dedicated Follower of Fashion]],'' songs by [[The Kinks]] that parody modern (1960s) dandyism.\n* [[Adonis]]\n* [[Bish\u014dnen]]\n* [[Dude]]\n* [[Effeminacy]]\n* [[Fl\u00e2neur]]\n* [[Fop]]\n* [[Gentleman]]\n* [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)]]\n* [[Incroyables and Merveilleuses]]\n* [[La Sape]]\n* [[Macaroni (fashion)|Macaroni]]\n* [[Metrosexual]]\n* [[Narcissus (mythology)]]\n* [[Preppy]]\n* [[Sexual suggestiveness|Risqu\u00e9]]\n* [[Swenkas]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly, Jules]].
