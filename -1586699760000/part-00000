They can incorporate a range of new information and communication tools, operating on [[desktop computer|desktop]]s and on [[laptop]]s, on mobile devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and smartphones. They may feature digital photo/video/sharing and diary entries online (blogging).<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=Danah M. |last2=Ellison |first2=Nicole B. |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=October 2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=210\u2013230 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x }}</ref> [[Online community]] services are sometimes considered social-network services by developers and users, though in a broader sense, a social-network service usually provides an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Defined as \"websites that facilitate the building of a network of contacts in order to exchange various types of content online,\" social networking sites provide a space for interaction to continue beyond in person interactions.

Depending on the [[social media]] platform, members may be able to contact any other member. In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on. The success of social networking services can be seen in their dominance in society today, with Facebook having a massive 2.13 billion active monthly users and an average of 1.4 billion [[daily active users]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/ |title=Company Info |publisher=Facebook Newsroom |access-date=April 12, 2018 }}</ref> [[LinkedIn]], a career-oriented social-networking service, generally requires that a member personally know another member in [[real life]] before they contact them online. Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to contact other members.\n\nThe main types of social networking services contain [[Psychographics|category places]] (such as age or occupation or religion), means to connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and a recommendation system linked to trust.

The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of \"friends\" who are also users of the site.<ref name=Boyd2007/> In an article entitled \"Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship,\" Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can \"type oneself into being\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or \"Applications\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.\n\n===Additional features===\nThere is a trend towards more [[Social network aggregation|interoperability between social networks]] led by technologies such as [[OpenID]] and [[OpenSocial]]. In most mobile communities, mobile phone users can now create their own profiles, make friends, participate in chat rooms, create chat rooms, hold private conversations, share photos and videos, and share blogs by using their mobile phone. Some companies provide wireless services that allow their customers to build their own mobile community and brand it; one of the most popular wireless services for social networking in [[North America]] and [[Nepal]] is Facebook Mobile.\n\n==Emerging trends==\n{{Rquote|right|The things you share are things that make you look good, things which you are happy to tie into your identity.|Hilary Mason, chief data scientist, [[bitly]]|{{nowrap|[[VentureBeat]], 2012}}<ref name=\"VentureBeat Byrne 2012\">{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=What you read is not what you share|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/23/bitly-realtime-hilary-mason/|accessdate=September 10, 2012|newspaper=[[VentureBeat]]|date=August 23, 2012}}</ref>}}\nWhile the popularity of social networking consistently rises,<ref>[http://www.google.com/trends?q=e-commerce%2C+social+networking&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1 Search for \"e-commerce, social networking\"].

Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded\u2014the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. [[Twitter]] set the trend for \"real-time\" services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. [[Facebook]] followed suit with their \"Live Feed\" where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, [[Clixtr]], another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site\u2014Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kessler|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/14/facebook-photo-infographic/?asid=c228f21b |title=Facebook Photos By the Numbers [INFOGRAPHIC]|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> In April 2012, the image-based social media network [[Pinterest]] had become the third largest social network in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/06/pinterest-number-3-social-network/|title=Pinterest is Now the No. 3 Social Network in the U.S. [STUDY]|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nCompanies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as [[cloud computing]], with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and [[Application software|applications]] that can be accessed via their websites, such as [[LinkedIn]]. Others companies, such as [[Monster.com]], have been steadily developing a more \"socialized\" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are \"Vocational Networking Sites\" or \"Vocational Media Networks\", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.\n\n[[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]] gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment. [[Gowalla]] is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does, leveraging the [[GPS]] in phones to create a location-based user experience. Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr [[iPhone]] app. Recently, [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=MG Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/yelp-iphone-app-4-check-ins/ |title=Yelp Enables Check-Ins On Its iPhone App; Foursquare, Gowalla Ousted As Mayors |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses. Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive,<ref name=\"marketing-jive.com\">Nimetz, Jody. [http://www.marketing-jive.com/2007/11/jody-nimetz-on-emerging-trends-in-b2b.html \"Jody Nimetz on Emerging Trends in B2B Social Networking\"]. Marketing-Jive, November 18, 2007.

As of September 2013, 71% of online adults use Facebook, 17% use Instagram, 21% use Pinterest, and 22% use LinkedIn.<ref>{{cite web|date=Oct 23, 2014|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|publisher=[[Pew Research]]|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/}}</ref>\n\n===Niche networks===\nIn 2012, it was reported that in the past few years, the niche social network has steadily grown in popularity, thanks to better levels of user interaction and engagement. In 2012, a survey by Reuters and research firm Ipsos<ref>{{cite news|date=Jan 4, 2012|title=Facebook comments, ads don't sway most users|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/05/net-us-facebook-survey-idUSBRE85400C20120605/}}</ref>\nfound that one in three users were getting bored with Facebook and in 2014 the GlobalWebIndex found that this figured had risen to almost 50%. The niche social network offers a specialized space that's designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs. Where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as Facebook and Twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism, now users are looking for connections, community and shared experiences. Social networks that tap directly into specific activities, hobbies, tastes, and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity. Niche social networks such as [[Fishbrain]] for [[fishing]] and [[Strava]] for [[cycling]]. These social platforms offer brands a rich space in which to engage with their target market and build awareness.\n\n===Science===\nOne other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liebeskind |first1=Julia Porter |last2=Oliver |first2=Amalya Lumerman |last3=Zucker |first3=Lynne |last4=Brewer |first4=Marilynn |title=Social Networks, Learning, and Flexibility: Sourcing Scientific Knowledge in New Biotechnology Firms |journal=Organization Science |date=1996 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=428\u2013443 |jstor=2635102 |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.4.428 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4480h6s7 }}</ref> They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to \"increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not have been possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization\".

For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between [[Digital Natives]] and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range\u2014in particular those born before and after 1980\u2014use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's \"Visitors\" and \"Residents\" (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers.

However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students has been known to affect their academic life negatively. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies.\n\nAlbayrak and Yildirim (2015) examined the educational use of social networking sites. They investigated students' involvement in Facebook as a Course Management System (CMS) and the findings of their study support that Facebook as a CMS has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and out-of-class communication among instructors and students.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albayrak | first1 = D. | last2 = Yildirim | first2 = Z | year = 2015 | title = Using Social Networking Sites for Teaching and Learning: Students' Involvement in and Acceptance of Facebook as a Course Management System | journal = Journal of Educational Computing Research | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 155\u2013179 | doi = 10.1177/0735633115571299 | hdl = 11693/23247 }}</ref>\n\n====Professional use====\nProfessional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest. SNSs like [[LinkedIn]], a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients.

A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=McKenna |first2=Katelyn Y.

Detecting such spamming activity has been well studied by developing a semi-automated model to detect spams.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100738 |chapter=Improving spam detection in Online Social Networks |title=2015 International Conference on Cognitive Computing and Information Processing(CCIP) |pages=1\u20136 |year=2015 |last1=Gupta |first1=Arushi |last2=Kaushal |first2=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-4799-7171-8 }}</ref> For instance, text mining techniques are leveraged<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/IACC.2016.12 |chapter=Analysis of Text Mining Techniques over Public Pages of Facebook |title=2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Advanced Computing (IACC) |pages=9\u201314 |year=2016 |last1=Agrawal |first1=Himanshi |last2=Kaushal |first2=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-4673-8286-1 }}</ref> to detect regular activity of spamming which reduces the viewership and brings down the reputation (or credibility) of a public pages<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-981-10-2738-3_16 |chapter=Credibility Assessment of Public Pages over Facebook |title=Security in Computing and Communications |volume=625 |pages=188\u2013198 |series=Communications in Computer and Information Science |year=2016 |last1=Agrawal |first1=Himanshi |last2=Kaushal |first2=Rishabh |isbn=978-981-10-2737-6 }}</ref> maintained over Facebook.

Users of these services also need to be aware of [[Computer insecurity|data theft]] or [[computer virus|viruses]]. However, large services, such as [[MySpace|Myspace]] and [[Netlog]], often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site [[Quechup]] harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a [[e-mail spam|spamming]] operation.<ref>[http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html Social network launches worldwide spam campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909161205/http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html |date=September 9, 2007 }} E-consultancy.com. Retrieved September 10, 2007</ref>\n\nIn medical and scientific research, asking subjects for information about their behaviors is normally strictly scrutinized by [[institutional review board]]s, for example, to ensure that adolescents and their parents have [[informed consent]]. It is not clear whether the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking sites. These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means. Even though the data are public, republishing it in a research paper might be considered [[invasion of privacy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moreno |first1=M. A. |last2=Fost |first2=N.

For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. \"For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=What Anyone Can Know: The Privacy Risks of Social Networking Sites|author=David Rosenblum|year=2007|doi=10.1109/MSP.2007.75|volume=5|issue = 3|journal=IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine|pages=40\u201349}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danah.org/papers/MySpaceDOPA.html|title=Discussion: MySpace and Deleting Online Predators Act (DOPA)|author1=Henry Jenkins  |author2=Danah Boyd |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 24, 2006|accessdate=May 26, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1394/1312|title=A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States|author=Susan B.

These would involve \"friending\" and \"following\" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures [[Openness to experience|openness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], and [[conscientiousness]] were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while [[neuroticism]] decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_11 |chapter=The Impact of User Diversity on the Willingness to Disclose Personal Information in Social Network Services |title=Human Factors in Computing and Informatics |volume=7946 |pages=174\u2013193 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2013 |last1=Schaar |first1=Anne Kathrin |last2=Calero Valdez |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last3=Ziefle |first3=Martina |isbn=978-3-642-39061-6 |chapter-url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4284b110f431910cf4ec72e1add50844f7a45f37 }}</ref>\n\nAnother debate lies in the design of [[algorithm]]ic<nowiki/>systems to target specific audiences on social networking sites. With multiple formats for marketing, [[Facebook]] offers a variety of direct marketing options for advertisers to reach their intended audience. For example, these ads may appear as suggested ad posts on the home [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] or on the right side of the feed as a banner. Businesses may create a page to outline their company and post related information, promotions and contact information to it, directly reaching their interested audience. Users who \"like\" a business page will be subscribed to receive these business' updates on their home News Feed. Banner ads and suggested posts are paid for by marketers and advertisers to reach their intended audience.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Jon D. |last2=Choi |first2=Yunmi |last3=Ju |first3=Ilyoung |title=Are Social Marketing and Advertising Communications (SMACs) Meaningful?: A Survey of Facebook User Emotional Responses, Source Credibility, Personal Relevance, and Perceived Intrusiveness |journal=Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising |date=25 May 2016 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013182 |doi=10.1080/10641734.2016.1171182 }}</ref> Like other methods of marketing, emotional connections are critical to reaching the user. From the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, Facebook increased its [[advertising]] click-through rate by 365%, having 2.5 million promoted suggested posts on user's news feeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/facebook-advertising-statistics/|title=135 Amazing Facebook Advertising Statistics|date=March 13, 2014|work=DMR|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> This surge of posts resulted in an influx of information that was difficult to organize. A study of the emotional responses to advertising on Facebook found that Business Pages found the highest appeal to users because they were only recommended when liked by the user or the user's friends. \u201cLiked\u201d pages have higher credibility to users. However, a change in algorithm announced on April 10, 2014, said that Business Pages were receiving a reduced reach after engaging in \u201cclick bait\u201d tactics (fooling users to click links to things other than what discretely said on Facebook). The quantity of engagement on Facebook posts are measured, relaying important information about the user audience and their actions online.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\"/>\n\nThe debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks \u201c[have] got eyes everywhere,\u201d and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even \u201crisk driving away followers in the process.\u201d This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Algorithmic surveillance has put humanity in touch with a new sort of omniscience -- the kind we can fool.|last=|first=|date=|work=New York Times Magazine|access-date=}}</ref> This debate was further ignited in early 2018. On April 10, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on questions defining Facebook's policy, information handling and data design systems. Congress placed emphasis on addressing Facebook's tracking of user data online, skeptical that the social networking site can regulate itself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook's Commitment to Privacy|last=Times|first=The New York|date=April 10, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Data mining===\nThrough [[data mining]], companies are able to improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer [[demographic]]s and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of \"[[Social network analysis|network analysis]] software\". This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Andy|title=Mining Social Networks: Untangling the Social Web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16910031|work=The Economist|date=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions\". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called [[Facebook Beacon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Elkins|first=Sarah|title=A Social Network's Faux Pas?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2007/11/08/a-social-network-s-faux-pas.html|work=Newsweek|date=2007-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Notifications ===\nThere has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only \"positive\" notifications to users. For example, sites such as Bebo, Facebook, and MySpace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a person's friends list. Likewise, Bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another user's friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the list. This allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends list. It also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out, rejection and failed relationships.\n\n===Access to information===\n{{See also|Unauthorized access in online social networks}}\n\nMany social networking services, such as [[Facebook]], provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as \"friends\" to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents.<ref name=Boyd2007/> To edit information on a certain social networking service account, the social networking sites require you to [[login|log in]] or provide a [[password]]. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.\n\n===Impact on employability===\nSocial networking sites have created issues among getting hired for jobs and losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary to those of the employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413659 |chapter=PoliticAlly: Finding political friends on twitter |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to ''Silicon Republic's'' statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing|title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media|work=Silicon Republic}}</ref> This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/23548618/facebook-flub-woman-gets-fired-over-post|title=Facebook flub: woman gets fired over post|author=NBC News|date=September 27, 2013|work=wrcbtv.com}}</ref> In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination. She lost her job, and was put under investigation by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/woman-fired-racist-anti-obama-facebook-post-article-1.1199917|title=Woman fired over racist anti-Obama Facebook post|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nNot only have employees lost their jobs in the United States, but it has happened with social network users internationally. In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bank-worker-stephanie-bon-fired-after-criticising-lloyds-bank-bosss-6295-an-hour-salary/story-e6frfm9r-1226034503421|title=Stephanie Bon fired for sarcastic Facebook post on Lloyds TSB CEO's \u00a34000-an-hour salary|work=NewsComAu|date=April 5, 2011}}</ref> In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers.

In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/23/facebook-says-it-may-launch-legal-action-against-employers-who-ask-for-user-passwords/|title=Facebook May Take Legal Action Over Employer Password Requests|author=Matt Brian|work=The Next Web|date=2012-03-23}}</ref> According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=326598317390057|title=Protecting Your Passwords and Your Privacy|work=facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n===Potential for misuse===\nThe relative freedom afforded by social networking services has caused concern regarding the potential of its misuse by individual patrons. In October 2006, a fake [[MySpace]] profile created in the name of Josh Evans by Lori Janine Drew led to the suicide of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21775032-11869,00.html |title=Fatal MySpace internet hoax mother is charged, ''Herald Sun'', 17 May 2008 |work=News.com.au |date=May 22, 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3882520 |title=Parents: Cyber Bullying Led to Teen's Suicide: Megan Meier's Parents Now Want Measures to Protect Children Online |date=November 29, 2007 |publisher=ABC News }}</ref> The event incited global concern regarding the use of social networking services for bullying purposes. In July 2008, a Briton and a former friend was ordered to pay a total of GBP \u00a322,000 (about US$44,000) for libel and breach of privacy. He had posted a fake page on [[Facebook]] purporting to be that of a former school friend Matthew Firsht, with whom he had fallen out in 2000. The page falsely claimed that Firsht was homosexual and that he was dishonest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAt the same time, genuine use of social networking services has been treated with suspicion on the ground of the services' misuse. In September 2008, the profile of Australian Facebook user Elmo Keep was banned by the site's administrators on the grounds that it violated the site's terms of use. Keep is one of several users of Facebook who were banned from the site on the presumption that their names aren't real, as they bear resemblance to the names of characters like [[Sesame Street]]'s Elmo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/banned-for-keeps-on-facebook-for-odd-name/2008/09/25/1222217399252.html |title=Banned for keeps on Facebook for odd name, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 September 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=September 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOnline social networks have also become a platform for spread of rumors, one such study has analyzed rumors in retrospect.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413660 |chapter=Rumor detection in twitter: An analysis in retrospect |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Dayani |first1=Raveena |last2=Chhabra |first2=Nikita |last3=Kadian |first3=Taruna |last4=Kaushal |first4=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> One of the approaches to detect rumors (or misinformation)<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732347 |chapter=Towards automated real-time detection of misinformation on Twitter |title=2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI) |pages=2015\u20132020 |year=2016 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-2029-4 }}</ref> is to compare the spread of topic over social network (say Twitter) with those spread by reliable and authorized news agencies.\n\n===Unauthorized access===\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.

According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through \"products of play\" in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators.

Such actions are often referred to as \"trolling\". Confrontations in the [[reality|real world]] can also be transferred to the online world. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making [[Flame bait|controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments]]. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to ''[[Psychology Today]]'' is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first= J. |year=2014|title= Why the Online Trolls Troll|url= https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/better-living-technology/201408/why-the-online-trolls-troll|website=psychologytoday.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The reason for the perceived lack of consequences is that they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a persona/[[avatar]] that they have created, which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll.\n\nTrolling is a prominent issue in the 2010s, and as the Internet and social media is consistently expanding and more individuals sign up to social networking sites, more people come under fire and become the target of trolls. As more people sign up to social networking sites, more celebrities are also becoming more prominent on these sites. With a variety of celebrities joining social networking sites, trolls tend to target abuse towards them. With some famous people gaining an influx of negative comments and slew of abuse from trolls it causes them to 'quit' social media. One prime example of a celebrity quitting social media is [[Stephen Fry]]. He left Twitter due to \"too much aggression and unkindness around\" emphasizing how trolls can negatively impact people's lives (Cohen, 2014).<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first= C. |year=2014|title= Twitter trolls: The celebrities who've been driven off social media by abuse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11238018/Celebrity-Twitter-trolls-The-famous-people-whove-been-driven-off-social-media-by-abuse.html|work=telegraph.co.uk}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As celebrities face trolls and backlash on social media forcing them to quit, it can mean that they become less in touch with their fans, potentially losing a fan base, as they are not as relevant as people enjoy interacting with celebrities and makes them feel as though they are valued. As trolling can lead to celebrities deleting their social networks such as Twitter, it emphasizes how trolls can win, and can ruin people's lives.\n\nWhile trolls believe that they do not face consequences and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in [[suicides attributed to bullying]], more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading [[hate speech]] such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer [[Fabrice Muamba]] collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012).<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first= Z. |year=2012|title= What is an Internet Troll?|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/12/what-is-an-internet-troll|work=theguardian.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals and they have to be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.\n\n===Online bullying===\nOnline bullying, also called [[cyberbullying]], is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim. Depending on the networking outlet, up to 39% of users admit to being \"cyber-bullied\".<ref>''Computer Science Illuminated''</ref> In her article, \"Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites\", [[danah boyd]], published in December 2007, a researcher of social networks, quotes a teenager. The teenager expresses frustration towards networking sites like MySpace because it causes drama and too much emotional stress.<ref name=Boyd2007/> There are not many limitations as to what individuals can post when online. Individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual.\n\n===Interpersonal communication===\nInterpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication. \"Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1394/1312#note4 | title=A Privacy Paradox}}</ref>\n\nThe convenience that social network sites give users to communicate with one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the founder and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, \"Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=154 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref> Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, \"They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then wonder if they are among friends. They become confused about companionship\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=17 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref>\n\n===Psychological effects of social networking===\n<!-- [[Social network addiction]] links to this section -->\nAs social networking sites have risen in popularity over the past years, people have been spending an excessive amount of time on the Internet in general and social networking sites in specific. This has led researchers to debate the establishment of Internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/24/earlyshow/main4205009.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title= CBS \"Social Networking: An Internet Addiction?\", CBS News, June 24, 2008 |publisher= CBS News |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>\nSocial networking can also affect the extent to which a person feels lonely. In a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, Johannah Cornblatt explains \"Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone.\" John T. Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, claims that social networking can foster feelings of sensitivity to disconnection, which can lead to loneliness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/20/lonely-planet.html |title= Cornblatt, Johannah, \"Lonely Planet\", Newsweek, August 21, 2009 |work= Newsweek |date=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> Fabio Sabatini and Francesco Sarracino found that if an individual tends to (a) trust people and (b) have a significant number of face-to-face interactions, the individual is likely to assess their own well-being as relatively high. The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself). Sabatini and Sarracino conclude that \"The overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative.\"<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/view/530401/evidence-grows-that-online-social-networks-have-insidious-negative-effects/ Evidence Grows That Online Social Networks Have Insidious Negative Effects], ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-20048148-238.html|title= Magid, Larry, \"Is there really 'Facebook depression?'\" |website= CNET|date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Social Media can be argued to have a positive influence on society by giving those who are highly introverted or socially inept a low risk means of communication that removes interpersonal cues that could cause anxiety or panic attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Cumming |first2=Steven R. |last3=Hughes |first3=Ian |title=Internet Use by the Socially Fearful: Addiction or Therapy? |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=February 2006 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201381 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9.69 |pmid=16497120 }}</ref> It has also been argued among academics that correct moderation by an authority figure such as a boss or parent can improve the perceived well being of an individual who navigates social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Padilla-Walker |first2=Laura M. |last3=Day |first3=Randal D. |last4=Harper |first4=James |last5=Stockdale |first5=Laura |title=A Friend Request from Dear Old Dad: Associations Between Parent\u2013Child Social Networking and Adolescent Outcomes |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |date=January 2014 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=8\u201313 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0623 |pmid=23845157 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fa6bb65447610c16d03154b31f0f5c50659c2126 }}</ref> As well as a variety of longitudinal studies that look at children at the start of the social media digital era up to the present, finding no correlation between social media screen time and mental health.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Padilla-Walker |first2=Laura M. |last3=Holmgren |first3=Hailey G. |last4=Stockdale |first4=Laura A. |title=Instagrowth: A Longitudinal Growth Mixture Model of Social Media Time Use Across Adolescence |journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=897\u2013907 |doi=10.1111/jora.12424 |pmid=29953692 |year=2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Rogers |first2=Adam A. |last3=Zurcher |first3=Jessica D. |last4=Stockdale |first4=Laura |last5=Booth |first5=McCall |title=Does time spent using social media impact mental health?: An eight year longitudinal study |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |date=March 2020 |volume=104 |pages=106160 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2019.106160 }}</ref>\n\n===Patents===\n[[File:Soc-net-paten-growth-chart.png|thumb|right|300px|Number of US social network patent applications published per year and patents issued per year]]\n\nThere has been rapid growth in the number of U.S. patent applications that cover new technologies related to social networking.

The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vlahakis|first=George|title=The Breakup 2.0': A Look at How New Media Is Used to End Relationships|url=http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|publisher=Indiana University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120226/http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|archive-date=June 25, 2013|df=}}</ref> In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook.<ref name=\"O'Dell\">{{cite web|last=O'Dell|first=Jolie|title=Would You Break Up via Facebook?|url=http://mashable.com/2010/06/21/facebook-break-up/|publisher=Mashable}}</ref> New media websites have made our private lives much more public, especially when it comes to breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed \"single\" relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.\n\nThis creates further problems, as it is even more crucial to 'save face' after one's relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. [[Erving Goffman]] argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as \"face-work\", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=On Face-Work: Interactions Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior|year=1967|publisher=Anchor|location=Garden City, NY|pages=5\u201345}}</ref> Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what \"face\" you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can \"save face\" by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.<ref name=\"O'Dell\"/>\n\nMany people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely. Social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult. In a 2012 study, 48% of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on Facebook, and of these people, 88% stated they 'creeped' their ex after the breakup. Many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a user's interactions,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Melander|first=L.A.|title=College students' perceptions of intimate partner cyber harassment|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|year=2010|volume=13|issue=3|pages=263\u2013268|doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0221|pmid=20557245|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c47d8b6027814a346ac7a11f57914aac66dc7ee}}</ref> so deleting content may be an arduous process, more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters, photos, and mementos.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Dijck|first=Jose|title=Mediated memories in the digital age|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref> Additionally, this content can still remain online.\n\n===Social overload===\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'.<ref name=\"Maier, C. 2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Maier | first1 = C. | last2 = Laumer | first2 = S. | last3 = Eckhardt | first3 = A. | last4 = Weitzel | first4 = T. | year = 2014 | title = Giving too much Social Support: Social Overload on Social Networking Sites | url = | journal = European Journal of Information Systems | volume =  24| issue = 5| pages =  447\u2013464| doi = 10.1057/ejis.2014.3 }}</ref> It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.<ref name=\"Maier, C. 2014\"/>\n\n=== Social anxiety ===\nSmartphones and social networking services enable us to stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called [[Fear of missing out|FoMO]]. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and [[life satisfaction]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Przybylski|first=Andrew K.|last2=Murayama|first2=Kou|last3=DeHaan|first3=Cody R.|last4=Gladwell|first4=Valerie|date=July 2013|title=Motivational, emotional, and behavioral correlates of fear of missing out|url= |journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1841\u20131848|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.014}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/12/18/the-devolution-of-friendship-full-essay-pts-i-ii/|title=Social Media and the Devolution of Friendship: Full Essay (Pts I & II)|last=Boesel|first=Whitney Erin|date=December 18, 2012|work=Cyborgology|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume. The FoBM is a counterpart of FoMO; however, compared to FoMO it may have a more serious impact since the exclusion from the conversation can result in continuous exclusion later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/10/22/fear-of-being-missed/|title=Fear of Being Missed|last=Davis|first=Janny|date=October 22, 2012|work=Cyborgology|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Effects on personal relationships and social capital===\nThe number of contacts on a social platform is sometimes considered an indicator of social capital. However, studies<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Kipling D. |last2=Karau |first2=Steven J. |title=Social loafing and social compensation: The effects of expectations of co-worker performance. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1991 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=570\u2013581 |doi=10.1037//0022-3514.61.4.570 |pmid=1960649 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Zheng |last2=Tchernev |first2=John M. |last3=Solloway |first3=Tyler |title=A dynamic longitudinal examination of social media use, needs, and gratifications among college students |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |date=September 2012 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=1829\u20131839 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.001 }}</ref> show it is rather an indicator of low self-esteem and of a form of social compensation. Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem and there is a high correlation between the number of \"friends\" on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia.  If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship \"redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves\" as stated by Francis Bacon.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-27.html| title=Of Friendship|publisher=Francis Bacon| date = 1601}}</ref> However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends, for instance, encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship, or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems. Actually, a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media. Friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n \nCroom et al. found that Facebook users know only a bit more than two thirds of their \"friends\" on the platform, meaning that they did not know one-third of the individuals in their friend-lists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Croom |first1=Charles |last2=Gross |first2=Bay |last3=Rosen |first3=Larry D. |last4=Rosen |first4=Brad |title=What's Her Face(book)?

Information posted on sites such as MySpace and Facebook has been used by police ([[forensic profiling]]), probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said sites. In some situations, content posted on MySpace has been used in court.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,,00.html \"MySpace exposes sex predators\"], use of its content in the courtroom: [[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd|Herald and Weekly Times (Australia)]] website. Retrieved January 19, 2008.</ref>\n\nFacebook is increasingly being used by school administrations and law enforcement agencies as a source of evidence against student users. This site being the number one online destination for college students, allows users to create profile pages with personal details. These pages can be viewed by other registered users from the same school, which often include resident assistants and campus police who have signed up for the service.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=670380 \"Getting booked by Facebook\"], courtesy of campus police: [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

Social networking tools serve as a quick and easy way for the government to get the suggestion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity, however this comes with a significant risk of abuse, for example, to cultivate a [[culture of fear]] such as that outlined in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[THX-1138]]''.\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control]] demonstrated the importance of [[vaccinations]] on the popular children's site [[Whyville]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] has a virtual island on [[Second Life]] where people can explore caves or explore the [[effects of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/topics/reader.aspx?oss=37848 |title=Government Agencies Establishing Presence on Social-Networking Sites |publisher=Itbusinessedge.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Likewise, NASA has taken advantage of a few social networking tools, including [[Twitter]] and [[Flickr]].

Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for [[entrepreneur]]s and [[small business]]es looking to expand their contact bases. These networks often act as a customer relationship management tool for companies selling products and services. Companies can also use social networks for advertising in the form of banners and text ads. Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as [[brand networking]]. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or score system. Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool. The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into internal culture of businesses where they are finding uses for [[collaboration]], [[file sharing]] and [[knowledge transfer]]. The term \"[[enterprise social software]]\" is becoming increasingly popular for these types of applications.\n\n===Dating applications===\n{{See also|Online dating service}}\nMany social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396461,00.html ''MySpace, Facebook Add Opportunity for Love, Trouble to Online Dating''], [[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] website.</ref> Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336688 ''MySpace Adds a Security Monitor''], [[NPR.com]] website.</ref> This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time, people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.<ref>[http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3659911 ''Online Dating: Can Social Networks Cut In?''], [[internetnews.com]] website.</ref>\n\nHowever, an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee, where social networks are free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/opinion/story/2449164/ |title=Online Dating vs. Social Networking \u2013 Which Will Emerge as Premier Matchmaker? |publisher=localtechwire.com|date=2008-08-18 }}</ref>\nThis difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as [[Match.com]], [[Yahoo Personals]], and [[eHarmony.com]] are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like [[MySpace]] and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users.<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid={4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD} ''Social networks vs. dating sites Commentary: Fragmenting may save online dating sites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203122438/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD%7D |date=December 3, 2007 }}, [[marketwatch.com]] website.</ref> The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/20/online-dating-love-tech-personal-cx_wt_1221dating.html ''Seeking Love Around The Web ''], ''[[Forbes]]'' website.</ref> Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.\n\n===Educational applications===\nThe [[National School Boards Association]] reports that almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day\u2014even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educators professional development, and content sharing. [[HASTAC]] is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; [[Ning (website)|Ning]] supports teachers; [[TermWiki]], [[TeachStreet]] and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, portfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online [[yearbook]]s, both public and private. One such service is [[MyYearbook]], which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is <!--Predicate agrees in number with its subject.--> private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to [[Facebook]]'s beginning within Harvard.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Finance applications===\nThe use of [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] systems inside social networks create new opportunities for global finance.

For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. [[DailyStrength]] is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by [[PatientsLikeMe]] and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. [[SparkPeople]] and [[HealthUnlocked]] offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users. Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks (such as Twitter) to discover large crowd concentration events (based on tweets location statistical analysis) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility-challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kousiouris |first1=George |last2=Akbar |first2=Adnan |last3=Sancho |first3=Juan |last4=Ta-shma |first4=Paula |last5=Psychas |first5=Alexandros |last6=Kyriazis |first6=Dimosthenis |last7=Varvarigou |first7=Theodora |title=An integrated information lifecycle management framework for exploiting social network data to identify dynamic large crowd concentration events in smart cities applications |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |date=January 2018 |volume=78 |pages=516\u2013530 |doi=10.1016/j.future.2017.07.026 |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/841839/1/LCC_pre_final%20%281%29.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Social and political applications===\nSocial networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Auer |first1=Matthew R. |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709\u2013736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 }}</ref> In the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt.

The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of \"friends\" who are also users of the site.<ref name=Boyd2007/> In an article entitled \"Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship,\" Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can \"type oneself into being\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or \"Applications\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.\n\n===Additional features===\nThere is a trend towards more [[Social network aggregation|interoperability between social networks]] led by technologies such as [[OpenID]] and [[OpenSocial]]. In most mobile communities, mobile phone users can now create their own profiles, make friends, participate in chat rooms, create chat rooms, hold private conversations, share photos and videos, and share blogs by using their mobile phone.

Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded\u2014the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. [[Twitter]] set the trend for \"real-time\" services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. [[Facebook]] followed suit with their \"Live Feed\" where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, [[Clixtr]], another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site\u2014Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kessler|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/14/facebook-photo-infographic/?asid=c228f21b |title=Facebook Photos By the Numbers [INFOGRAPHIC]|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> In April 2012, the image-based social media network [[Pinterest]] had become the third largest social network in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/06/pinterest-number-3-social-network/|title=Pinterest is Now the No. 3 Social Network in the U.S. [STUDY]|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nCompanies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as [[cloud computing]], with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and [[Application software|applications]] that can be accessed via their websites, such as [[LinkedIn]]. Others companies, such as [[Monster.com]], have been steadily developing a more \"socialized\" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are \"Vocational Networking Sites\" or \"Vocational Media Networks\", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.\n\n[[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]] gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment. [[Gowalla]] is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does, leveraging the [[GPS]] in phones to create a location-based user experience. Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr [[iPhone]] app. Recently, [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=MG Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/yelp-iphone-app-4-check-ins/ |title=Yelp Enables Check-Ins On Its iPhone App; Foursquare, Gowalla Ousted As Mayors |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses. Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive,<ref name=\"marketing-jive.com\">Nimetz, Jody.

In 2012, a survey by Reuters and research firm Ipsos<ref>{{cite news|date=Jan 4, 2012|title=Facebook comments, ads don't sway most users|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/05/net-us-facebook-survey-idUSBRE85400C20120605/}}</ref>\nfound that one in three users were getting bored with Facebook and in 2014 the GlobalWebIndex found that this figured had risen to almost 50%. The niche social network offers a specialized space that's designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs. Where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as Facebook and Twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism, now users are looking for connections, community and shared experiences. Social networks that tap directly into specific activities, hobbies, tastes, and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity. Niche social networks such as [[Fishbrain]] for [[fishing]] and [[Strava]] for [[cycling]]. These social platforms offer brands a rich space in which to engage with their target market and build awareness.\n\n===Science===\nOne other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liebeskind |first1=Julia Porter |last2=Oliver |first2=Amalya Lumerman |last3=Zucker |first3=Lynne |last4=Brewer |first4=Marilynn |title=Social Networks, Learning, and Flexibility: Sourcing Scientific Knowledge in New Biotechnology Firms |journal=Organization Science |date=1996 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=428\u2013443 |jstor=2635102 |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.4.428 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4480h6s7 }}</ref> They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to \"increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not have been possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization\".

For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between [[Digital Natives]] and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range\u2014in particular those born before and after 1980\u2014use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's \"Visitors\" and \"Residents\" (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), \"[[Social networking sites]], like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policymakers.\"<ref name=group>{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Brake, David R |title=On the Rapid Rise of Social Networking Sites: New Findings and Policy Implications|journal=Children & Society|date=December 2010|volume=24|issue=1|pages=75\u201383|doi=10.1111/j.1099-0860.2009.00243.x|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30124/1/On_the_rapid_rise_of_social_networking_(LSERO_version).pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref> Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website.<ref name=Lenhart>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Pew Internet & American Life Project\n| last = Lenhart\n| first = Amanda\n| first2 = Kristen\n| last2 = Purcell\n| first3 = Aaron\n| last3 = Smith\n| first4 = Kathryn\n| last4 = Zickuhr\n| title = Social Media & Mobile Internet Use Among Teens and Young Adults.

However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students has been known to affect their academic life negatively. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies.\n\nAlbayrak and Yildirim (2015) examined the educational use of social networking sites. They investigated students' involvement in Facebook as a Course Management System (CMS) and the findings of their study support that Facebook as a CMS has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and out-of-class communication among instructors and students.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albayrak | first1 = D. | last2 = Yildirim | first2 = Z | year = 2015 | title = Using Social Networking Sites for Teaching and Learning: Students' Involvement in and Acceptance of Facebook as a Course Management System | journal = Journal of Educational Computing Research | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 155\u2013179 | doi = 10.1177/0735633115571299 | hdl = 11693/23247 }}</ref>\n\n====Professional use====\nProfessional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest. SNSs like [[LinkedIn]], a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients. LinkedIn not only provides a professional social use but also encourages people to inject their personality into their profile\u2013making it more personal than a resume.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arruda |first=William |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2014/03/04/22-linkedin-secrets-linkedin-wont-tell-you/ |title=22 LinkedIn Secrets LinkedIn Won't Tell You |work=Forbes |date=March 4, 2014 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> Now the other network sites are also being used in this manner.

Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.\n\n===Grassroots organizing===\nSocial networks are being used by activists as a means of low-cost grassroots organizing. Extensive use of an array of social networking sites enabled organizers of 2009 [[National Equality March]] to mobilize an estimated 200,000 participants to march on Washington with a cost savings of up to 85% per participant over previous methods.<ref name=\"march\">{{cite news\n | last = Carlson\n | first = Ben\n | title = March 2.0: Success of the National Equality March relied on social media tools\n | publisher = Media Bullseye\n | date = April 28, 2010\n | url = http://www.mediabullseye.com/2010/04/march-2-0-success-of-the-national-equality-march-relied-on-social-media-tools/\n | accessdate = May 2, 2017}}</ref>\nThe August [[2011 England riots]] were similarly considered to have escalated and been fuelled by this type of grassroots organization.\n\n===Employment===\nA rise in social network use is being driven by college students using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities. Many studies have been done on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting, and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in ''Advances in Social Network Analysis.''<ref>Arabie, Phipps, and Yoram Wind.

However, these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice providers. One new social networking service, Ask-a-peer, aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time. LinkedIn is also another great resource. It helps alumni, students and unemployed individuals look for work. They are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies.\n\nIn addition, employers have been found to use social network sites to screen job candidates.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/1461444816687294|title = Facebook profile picture appearance affects recruiters' first hiring decisions|journal = New Media & Society|volume = 20|issue = 3|pages = 1220\u20131239|year = 2018|last1 = Baert|first1 = Stijn|url = https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8507595|hdl = 1854/LU-8507595}}</ref>\n\n===Hosting service===\nA [[social network hosting service]] is a web hosting service that specifically hosts the user creation of web-based social networking services, alongside related applications.\n\n===Trading networks===\nA social trade network is a service that allows traders of [[financial derivative]]s such as contracts for difference or foreign exchange contracts to share their trading activity via trading profiles online. Their services are created by financial brokers.\n\n===Business model===\nFew social networks charge money for membership. In part, this may be because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as [[MySpace|Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] sell [[online advertising]] on their site. Their business model is based upon large membership count, and charging for membership would be counterproductive.<ref>Chambers, Clem.

More and more relationships and friendships are being formed online and then carried to an offline setting. Psychologist and University of Hamburg professor Erich H. Witte says that relationships which start online are much more likely to succeed. In this regard, there are studies which predict tie strength among the friends<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kaushal |first1=R. |title=Tie strength prediction in OSN |journal=2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom) |date=2016 |pages=841\u2013844 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7724383|isbn=978-9-3805-4421-2 }}</ref> on social networking websites.  One online dating site claims that 2% of all marriages begin at its site, the equivalent of 236 marriages a day. Other sites claim one in five relationships begin online.\n\nUsers do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them, but rather that which projects a good impression of themselves.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Byrne 2012\"/> While everyone agrees that social networking has had a significant impact on social interaction, there remains a substantial disagreement as to whether the nature of this impact is completely positive. A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=McKenna |first2=Katelyn Y.

A primary motivation to spam arises from the fact that a user advertising a brand would like others to see them and they typically publicize their brand over the social network. Detecting such spamming activity has been well studied by developing a semi-automated model to detect spams.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100738 |chapter=Improving spam detection in Online Social Networks |title=2015 International Conference on Cognitive Computing and Information Processing(CCIP) |pages=1\u20136 |year=2015 |last1=Gupta |first1=Arushi |last2=Kaushal |first2=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-4799-7171-8 }}</ref> For instance, text mining techniques are leveraged<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/IACC.2016.12 |chapter=Analysis of Text Mining Techniques over Public Pages of Facebook |title=2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Advanced Computing (IACC) |pages=9\u201314 |year=2016 |last1=Agrawal |first1=Himanshi |last2=Kaushal |first2=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-4673-8286-1 }}</ref> to detect regular activity of spamming which reduces the viewership and brings down the reputation (or credibility) of a public pages<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-981-10-2738-3_16 |chapter=Credibility Assessment of Public Pages over Facebook |title=Security in Computing and Communications |volume=625 |pages=188\u2013198 |series=Communications in Computer and Information Science |year=2016 |last1=Agrawal |first1=Himanshi |last2=Kaushal |first2=Rishabh |isbn=978-981-10-2737-6 }}</ref> maintained over Facebook.

Users of these services also need to be aware of [[Computer insecurity|data theft]] or [[computer virus|viruses]]. However, large services, such as [[MySpace|Myspace]] and [[Netlog]], often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site [[Quechup]] harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a [[e-mail spam|spamming]] operation.<ref>[http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html Social network launches worldwide spam campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909161205/http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html |date=September 9, 2007 }} E-consultancy.com.

It is not clear whether the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking sites. These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means. Even though the data are public, republishing it in a research paper might be considered [[invasion of privacy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moreno |first1=M. A. |last2=Fost |first2=N.

For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. \"For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off.

These would involve \"friending\" and \"following\" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures [[Openness to experience|openness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], and [[conscientiousness]] were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while [[neuroticism]] decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_11 |chapter=The Impact of User Diversity on the Willingness to Disclose Personal Information in Social Network Services |title=Human Factors in Computing and Informatics |volume=7946 |pages=174\u2013193 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2013 |last1=Schaar |first1=Anne Kathrin |last2=Calero Valdez |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last3=Ziefle |first3=Martina |isbn=978-3-642-39061-6 |chapter-url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4284b110f431910cf4ec72e1add50844f7a45f37 }}</ref>\n\nAnother debate lies in the design of [[algorithm]]ic<nowiki/>systems to target specific audiences on social networking sites. With multiple formats for marketing, [[Facebook]] offers a variety of direct marketing options for advertisers to reach their intended audience. For example, these ads may appear as suggested ad posts on the home [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] or on the right side of the feed as a banner. Businesses may create a page to outline their company and post related information, promotions and contact information to it, directly reaching their interested audience. Users who \"like\" a business page will be subscribed to receive these business' updates on their home News Feed. Banner ads and suggested posts are paid for by marketers and advertisers to reach their intended audience.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Jon D. |last2=Choi |first2=Yunmi |last3=Ju |first3=Ilyoung |title=Are Social Marketing and Advertising Communications (SMACs) Meaningful?: A Survey of Facebook User Emotional Responses, Source Credibility, Personal Relevance, and Perceived Intrusiveness |journal=Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising |date=25 May 2016 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013182 |doi=10.1080/10641734.2016.1171182 }}</ref> Like other methods of marketing, emotional connections are critical to reaching the user. From the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, Facebook increased its [[advertising]] click-through rate by 365%, having 2.5 million promoted suggested posts on user's news feeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/facebook-advertising-statistics/|title=135 Amazing Facebook Advertising Statistics|date=March 13, 2014|work=DMR|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> This surge of posts resulted in an influx of information that was difficult to organize. A study of the emotional responses to advertising on Facebook found that Business Pages found the highest appeal to users because they were only recommended when liked by the user or the user's friends. \u201cLiked\u201d pages have higher credibility to users. However, a change in algorithm announced on April 10, 2014, said that Business Pages were receiving a reduced reach after engaging in \u201cclick bait\u201d tactics (fooling users to click links to things other than what discretely said on Facebook). The quantity of engagement on Facebook posts are measured, relaying important information about the user audience and their actions online.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\"/>\n\nThe debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks \u201c[have] got eyes everywhere,\u201d and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even \u201crisk driving away followers in the process.\u201d This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Algorithmic surveillance has put humanity in touch with a new sort of omniscience -- the kind we can fool.|last=|first=|date=|work=New York Times Magazine|access-date=}}</ref> This debate was further ignited in early 2018. On April 10, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on questions defining Facebook's policy, information handling and data design systems. Congress placed emphasis on addressing Facebook's tracking of user data online, skeptical that the social networking site can regulate itself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook's Commitment to Privacy|last=Times|first=The New York|date=April 10, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Data mining===\nThrough [[data mining]], companies are able to improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer [[demographic]]s and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of \"[[Social network analysis|network analysis]] software\". This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Andy|title=Mining Social Networks: Untangling the Social Web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16910031|work=The Economist|date=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions\". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called [[Facebook Beacon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Elkins|first=Sarah|title=A Social Network's Faux Pas?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2007/11/08/a-social-network-s-faux-pas.html|work=Newsweek|date=2007-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Notifications ===\nThere has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only \"positive\" notifications to users. For example, sites such as Bebo, Facebook, and MySpace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a person's friends list. Likewise, Bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another user's friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the list. This allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends list. It also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out, rejection and failed relationships.\n\n===Access to information===\n{{See also|Unauthorized access in online social networks}}\n\nMany social networking services, such as [[Facebook]], provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as \"friends\" to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents.<ref name=Boyd2007/> To edit information on a certain social networking service account, the social networking sites require you to [[login|log in]] or provide a [[password]]. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.\n\n===Impact on employability===\nSocial networking sites have created issues among getting hired for jobs and losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary to those of the employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413659 |chapter=PoliticAlly: Finding political friends on twitter |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to ''Silicon Republic's'' statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing|title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media|work=Silicon Republic}}</ref> This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/23548618/facebook-flub-woman-gets-fired-over-post|title=Facebook flub: woman gets fired over post|author=NBC News|date=September 27, 2013|work=wrcbtv.com}}</ref> In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination.

He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job.

In July 2008, a Briton and a former friend was ordered to pay a total of GBP \u00a322,000 (about US$44,000) for libel and breach of privacy. He had posted a fake page on [[Facebook]] purporting to be that of a former school friend Matthew Firsht, with whom he had fallen out in 2000. The page falsely claimed that Firsht was homosexual and that he was dishonest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAt the same time, genuine use of social networking services has been treated with suspicion on the ground of the services' misuse. In September 2008, the profile of Australian Facebook user Elmo Keep was banned by the site's administrators on the grounds that it violated the site's terms of use. Keep is one of several users of Facebook who were banned from the site on the presumption that their names aren't real, as they bear resemblance to the names of characters like [[Sesame Street]]'s Elmo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/banned-for-keeps-on-facebook-for-odd-name/2008/09/25/1222217399252.html |title=Banned for keeps on Facebook for odd name, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 September 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=September 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOnline social networks have also become a platform for spread of rumors, one such study has analyzed rumors in retrospect.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413660 |chapter=Rumor detection in twitter: An analysis in retrospect |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Dayani |first1=Raveena |last2=Chhabra |first2=Nikita |last3=Kadian |first3=Taruna |last4=Kaushal |first4=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> One of the approaches to detect rumors (or misinformation)<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732347 |chapter=Towards automated real-time detection of misinformation on Twitter |title=2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI) |pages=2015\u20132020 |year=2016 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-2029-4 }}</ref> is to compare the spread of topic over social network (say Twitter) with those spread by reliable and authorized news agencies.\n\n===Unauthorized access===\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.

According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through \"products of play\" in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators.

Such actions are often referred to as \"trolling\". Confrontations in the [[reality|real world]] can also be transferred to the online world. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making [[Flame bait|controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments]]. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to ''[[Psychology Today]]'' is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first= J. |year=2014|title= Why the Online Trolls Troll|url= https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/better-living-technology/201408/why-the-online-trolls-troll|website=psychologytoday.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The reason for the perceived lack of consequences is that they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a persona/[[avatar]] that they have created, which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll.\n\nTrolling is a prominent issue in the 2010s, and as the Internet and social media is consistently expanding and more individuals sign up to social networking sites, more people come under fire and become the target of trolls. As more people sign up to social networking sites, more celebrities are also becoming more prominent on these sites. With a variety of celebrities joining social networking sites, trolls tend to target abuse towards them. With some famous people gaining an influx of negative comments and slew of abuse from trolls it causes them to 'quit' social media. One prime example of a celebrity quitting social media is [[Stephen Fry]]. He left Twitter due to \"too much aggression and unkindness around\" emphasizing how trolls can negatively impact people's lives (Cohen, 2014).<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first= C. |year=2014|title= Twitter trolls: The celebrities who've been driven off social media by abuse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11238018/Celebrity-Twitter-trolls-The-famous-people-whove-been-driven-off-social-media-by-abuse.html|work=telegraph.co.uk}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As celebrities face trolls and backlash on social media forcing them to quit, it can mean that they become less in touch with their fans, potentially losing a fan base, as they are not as relevant as people enjoy interacting with celebrities and makes them feel as though they are valued. As trolling can lead to celebrities deleting their social networks such as Twitter, it emphasizes how trolls can win, and can ruin people's lives.\n\nWhile trolls believe that they do not face consequences and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in [[suicides attributed to bullying]], more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading [[hate speech]] such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer [[Fabrice Muamba]] collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012).<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first= Z. |year=2012|title= What is an Internet Troll?|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/12/what-is-an-internet-troll|work=theguardian.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals and they have to be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.\n\n===Online bullying===\nOnline bullying, also called [[cyberbullying]], is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim. Depending on the networking outlet, up to 39% of users admit to being \"cyber-bullied\".<ref>''Computer Science Illuminated''</ref> In her article, \"Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites\", [[danah boyd]], published in December 2007, a researcher of social networks, quotes a teenager. The teenager expresses frustration towards networking sites like MySpace because it causes drama and too much emotional stress.<ref name=Boyd2007/> There are not many limitations as to what individuals can post when online. Individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual.\n\n===Interpersonal communication===\nInterpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication. \"Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1394/1312#note4 | title=A Privacy Paradox}}</ref>\n\nThe convenience that social network sites give users to communicate with one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the founder and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, \"Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=154 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref> Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, \"They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then wonder if they are among friends. They become confused about companionship\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=17 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref>\n\n===Psychological effects of social networking===\n<!-- [[Social network addiction]] links to this section -->\nAs social networking sites have risen in popularity over the past years, people have been spending an excessive amount of time on the Internet in general and social networking sites in specific. This has led researchers to debate the establishment of Internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/24/earlyshow/main4205009.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title= CBS \"Social Networking: An Internet Addiction?\", CBS News, June 24, 2008 |publisher= CBS News |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>\nSocial networking can also affect the extent to which a person feels lonely. In a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, Johannah Cornblatt explains \"Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone.\" John T. Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, claims that social networking can foster feelings of sensitivity to disconnection, which can lead to loneliness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/20/lonely-planet.html |title= Cornblatt, Johannah, \"Lonely Planet\", Newsweek, August 21, 2009 |work= Newsweek |date=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> Fabio Sabatini and Francesco Sarracino found that if an individual tends to (a) trust people and (b) have a significant number of face-to-face interactions, the individual is likely to assess their own well-being as relatively high. The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself). Sabatini and Sarracino conclude that \"The overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative.\"<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/view/530401/evidence-grows-that-online-social-networks-have-insidious-negative-effects/ Evidence Grows That Online Social Networks Have Insidious Negative Effects], ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-20048148-238.html|title= Magid, Larry, \"Is there really 'Facebook depression?'\" |website= CNET|date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Social Media can be argued to have a positive influence on society by giving those who are highly introverted or socially inept a low risk means of communication that removes interpersonal cues that could cause anxiety or panic attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Cumming |first2=Steven R. |last3=Hughes |first3=Ian |title=Internet Use by the Socially Fearful: Addiction or Therapy? |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=February 2006 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201381 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9.69 |pmid=16497120 }}</ref> It has also been argued among academics that correct moderation by an authority figure such as a boss or parent can improve the perceived well being of an individual who navigates social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Padilla-Walker |first2=Laura M. |last3=Day |first3=Randal D. |last4=Harper |first4=James |last5=Stockdale |first5=Laura |title=A Friend Request from Dear Old Dad: Associations Between Parent\u2013Child Social Networking and Adolescent Outcomes |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |date=January 2014 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=8\u201313 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0623 |pmid=23845157 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fa6bb65447610c16d03154b31f0f5c50659c2126 }}</ref> As well as a variety of longitudinal studies that look at children at the start of the social media digital era up to the present, finding no correlation between social media screen time and mental health.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Padilla-Walker |first2=Laura M. |last3=Holmgren |first3=Hailey G. |last4=Stockdale |first4=Laura A. |title=Instagrowth: A Longitudinal Growth Mixture Model of Social Media Time Use Across Adolescence |journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=897\u2013907 |doi=10.1111/jora.12424 |pmid=29953692 |year=2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Rogers |first2=Adam A. |last3=Zurcher |first3=Jessica D. |last4=Stockdale |first4=Laura |last5=Booth |first5=McCall |title=Does time spent using social media impact mental health?: An eight year longitudinal study |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |date=March 2020 |volume=104 |pages=106160 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2019.106160 }}</ref>\n\n===Patents===\n[[File:Soc-net-paten-growth-chart.png|thumb|right|300px|Number of US social network patent applications published per year and patents issued per year]]\n\nThere has been rapid growth in the number of U.S. patent applications that cover new technologies related to social networking.

There are several proposals, leveraging a decentralized architecture to ensure the scalability of SNS sites with low infrastructure cost.

A 2013 study in the journal ''Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking'' investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%).

The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vlahakis|first=George|title=The Breakup 2.0': A Look at How New Media Is Used to End Relationships|url=http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|publisher=Indiana University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120226/http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|archive-date=June 25, 2013|df=}}</ref> In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook.<ref name=\"O'Dell\">{{cite web|last=O'Dell|first=Jolie|title=Would You Break Up via Facebook?|url=http://mashable.com/2010/06/21/facebook-break-up/|publisher=Mashable}}</ref> New media websites have made our private lives much more public, especially when it comes to breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed \"single\" relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.\n\nThis creates further problems, as it is even more crucial to 'save face' after one's relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. [[Erving Goffman]] argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as \"face-work\", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=On Face-Work: Interactions Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior|year=1967|publisher=Anchor|location=Garden City, NY|pages=5\u201345}}</ref> Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what \"face\" you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can \"save face\" by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.<ref name=\"O'Dell\"/>\n\nMany people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely. Social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult. In a 2012 study, 48% of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on Facebook, and of these people, 88% stated they 'creeped' their ex after the breakup. Many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a user's interactions,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Melander|first=L.A.|title=College students' perceptions of intimate partner cyber harassment|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|year=2010|volume=13|issue=3|pages=263\u2013268|doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0221|pmid=20557245|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c47d8b6027814a346ac7a11f57914aac66dc7ee}}</ref> so deleting content may be an arduous process, more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters, photos, and mementos.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Dijck|first=Jose|title=Mediated memories in the digital age|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref> Additionally, this content can still remain online.\n\n===Social overload===\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'.<ref name=\"Maier, C. 2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Maier | first1 = C. | last2 = Laumer | first2 = S. | last3 = Eckhardt | first3 = A. | last4 = Weitzel | first4 = T. | year = 2014 | title = Giving too much Social Support: Social Overload on Social Networking Sites | url = | journal = European Journal of Information Systems | volume =  24| issue = 5| pages =  447\u2013464| doi = 10.1057/ejis.2014.3 }}</ref> It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.<ref name=\"Maier, C. 2014\"/>\n\n=== Social anxiety ===\nSmartphones and social networking services enable us to stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called [[Fear of missing out|FoMO]]. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and [[life satisfaction]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Przybylski|first=Andrew K.|last2=Murayama|first2=Kou|last3=DeHaan|first3=Cody R.|last4=Gladwell|first4=Valerie|date=July 2013|title=Motivational, emotional, and behavioral correlates of fear of missing out|url= |journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1841\u20131848|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.014}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/12/18/the-devolution-of-friendship-full-essay-pts-i-ii/|title=Social Media and the Devolution of Friendship: Full Essay (Pts I & II)|last=Boesel|first=Whitney Erin|date=December 18, 2012|work=Cyborgology|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume.

Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem and there is a high correlation between the number of \"friends\" on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia.  If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship \"redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves\" as stated by Francis Bacon.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-27.html| title=Of Friendship|publisher=Francis Bacon| date = 1601}}</ref> However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends, for instance, encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship, or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems. Actually, a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media. Friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n \nCroom et al. found that Facebook users know only a bit more than two thirds of their \"friends\" on the platform, meaning that they did not know one-third of the individuals in their friend-lists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Croom |first1=Charles |last2=Gross |first2=Bay |last3=Rosen |first3=Larry D. |last4=Rosen |first4=Brad |title=What's Her Face(book)?

Information posted on sites such as MySpace and Facebook has been used by police ([[forensic profiling]]), probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said sites.

This site being the number one online destination for college students, allows users to create profile pages with personal details. These pages can be viewed by other registered users from the same school, which often include resident assistants and campus police who have signed up for the service.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=670380 \"Getting booked by Facebook\"], courtesy of campus police: [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

Social networking tools serve as a quick and easy way for the government to get the suggestion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity, however this comes with a significant risk of abuse, for example, to cultivate a [[culture of fear]] such as that outlined in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[THX-1138]]''.\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control]] demonstrated the importance of [[vaccinations]] on the popular children's site [[Whyville]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] has a virtual island on [[Second Life]] where people can explore caves or explore the [[effects of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/topics/reader.aspx?oss=37848 |title=Government Agencies Establishing Presence on Social-Networking Sites |publisher=Itbusinessedge.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Likewise, NASA has taken advantage of a few social networking tools, including [[Twitter]] and [[Flickr]].

Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for [[entrepreneur]]s and [[small business]]es looking to expand their contact bases. These networks often act as a customer relationship management tool for companies selling products and services. Companies can also use social networks for advertising in the form of banners and text ads. Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as [[brand networking]]. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or score system. Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool. The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into internal culture of businesses where they are finding uses for [[collaboration]], [[file sharing]] and [[knowledge transfer]]. The term \"[[enterprise social software]]\" is becoming increasingly popular for these types of applications.\n\n===Dating applications===\n{{See also|Online dating service}}\nMany social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396461,00.html ''MySpace, Facebook Add Opportunity for Love, Trouble to Online Dating''], [[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] website.</ref> Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336688 ''MySpace Adds a Security Monitor''], [[NPR.com]] website.</ref> This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time, people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.<ref>[http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3659911 ''Online Dating: Can Social Networks Cut In?''], [[internetnews.com]] website.</ref>\n\nHowever, an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee, where social networks are free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/opinion/story/2449164/ |title=Online Dating vs. Social Networking \u2013 Which Will Emerge as Premier Matchmaker? |publisher=localtechwire.com|date=2008-08-18 }}</ref>\nThis difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as [[Match.com]], [[Yahoo Personals]], and [[eHarmony.com]] are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like [[MySpace]] and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users.<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid={4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD} ''Social networks vs. dating sites Commentary: Fragmenting may save online dating sites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203122438/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD%7D |date=December 3, 2007 }}, [[marketwatch.com]] website.</ref> The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/20/online-dating-love-tech-personal-cx_wt_1221dating.html ''Seeking Love Around The Web ''], ''[[Forbes]]'' website.</ref> Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.\n\n===Educational applications===\nThe [[National School Boards Association]] reports that almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day\u2014even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educators professional development, and content sharing. [[HASTAC]] is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; [[Ning (website)|Ning]] supports teachers; [[TermWiki]], [[TeachStreet]] and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, portfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online [[yearbook]]s, both public and private. One such service is [[MyYearbook]], which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is <!--Predicate agrees in number with its subject.--> private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to [[Facebook]]'s beginning within Harvard.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Finance applications===\nThe use of [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] systems inside social networks create new opportunities for global finance.

For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. [[DailyStrength]] is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by [[PatientsLikeMe]] and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. [[SparkPeople]] and [[HealthUnlocked]] offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users. Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks (such as Twitter) to discover large crowd concentration events (based on tweets location statistical analysis) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility-challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kousiouris |first1=George |last2=Akbar |first2=Adnan |last3=Sancho |first3=Juan |last4=Ta-shma |first4=Paula |last5=Psychas |first5=Alexandros |last6=Kyriazis |first6=Dimosthenis |last7=Varvarigou |first7=Theodora |title=An integrated information lifecycle management framework for exploiting social network data to identify dynamic large crowd concentration events in smart cities applications |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |date=January 2018 |volume=78 |pages=516\u2013530 |doi=10.1016/j.future.2017.07.026 |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/841839/1/LCC_pre_final%20%281%29.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Social and political applications===\nSocial networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Auer |first1=Matthew R. |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709\u2013736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 }}</ref> In the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt.

It was the first of its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forevermore in the ever-changing technological world we find ourselves in today.

However, a year later, Obama was sending out voting reminders to thousands of people through Twitter, showing just how fast social media moves. Obama's campaign was current and needed to be successful in incorporating social media, as social media acts best and is most effective in real time.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nBuilding up to the 2012 presidential election, it was interesting to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media.<ref name=Rutledge>{{cite web |title=How Obama Won the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential Campaign |url=http://mprcenter.org/blog/2013/01/how-obama-won-the-social-media-battle-in-the-2012-presidential-campaign/ |website=Media Psychology Research Center }}</ref> Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.\n\nOther political campaigns have followed on from Obama's successful social media campaigns, recognizing the power of social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their political campaigns, for example, Donald Trump's presidential electoral campaign, 2016. Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's former digital and social media guru, commented that Donald Trump is \"way better at the internet than anyone else in the GOP which is partly why he is winning\".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Hannah Jane |last1=Parkinson |year=2015 |title=Can Donald Trump's social media genius take him all the way to the White House?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/donald-trump-social-media-strategy-internet-republican-nomination-president |accessdate=April 25, 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that 66% of social media users actively engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones.<ref name=Rutledge/> With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that young people who are politically active online are double as likely to vote than those who are not politically active online.<ref name=Rutledge/> Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites.
