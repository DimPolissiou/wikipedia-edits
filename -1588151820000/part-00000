Debates about human nature are related to, although not the same as, debates about the comparative importance of [[gene]]s and environment in [[Developmental psychology|development]] (\"[[nature versus nurture]]\").\n\nThe concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments is traditionally said to have begun in [[Greek philosophy]], at least as regards the [[Western world|Western]] and [[Middle East]]ern languages and perspectives which are heavily influenced by it.<ref>\"Progress or Refurn\" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.</ref>\n\nThe [[Teleology|teleological]] approach of [[Aristotle]] came to be dominant by late classical and medieval times. By this account, human nature really causes humans to become what they become, and so it exists somehow independently of individuals. This in turn has been understood as also showing a special connection between human nature and [[divinity]]. This approach understands human nature in terms of [[final cause|final]] and [[formal cause|formal]] [[Causality|causes]]. In other words, nature itself (or a nature-creating divinity) has intentions and goals, similar somehow to human intentions and goals, and one of those goals is humanity living naturally. Such understandings of human nature see this nature as an \"idea\", or \"[[Theory of Forms|form]]\" of a human.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D13%3Asection%3D1078b 1078b].</ref>\n\nHowever, the existence of this invariable and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] human nature is subject of much historical debate, continuing into modern times. Against this idea of a fixed human nature, the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries\u2014firstly by early modernists such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. In Rousseau's ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', Rousseau wrote: \"We do not know what our nature permits us to be\".<ref>{{cite encyclopaedia|year=1995 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |last=Saunders |first=Jason Lewis |url=http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_99_82.html |title=Western Philosophical Schools and Doctrines: Ancient and Medieval Schools: Sophists: Particular Doctrines: Theoretical issues |accessdate=7 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527020558/http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_99_82.html |archivedate=27 May 2011 }}</ref> Since the early 19th century, thinkers such as [[Hegel]], [[Marx's theory of human nature|Marx]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Sartre]], [[Structuralism|structuralists]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodernists]] have also sometimes argued against a fixed or innate human nature.\n\n[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] has changed the nature of the discussion, supporting the proposition that mankind's ancestors were not like mankind today. Still more recent scientific perspectives\u2014such as [[behaviorism]], [[determinism]], and the chemical model within modern [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]]\u2014claim to be neutral regarding human nature. As in much of modern science, such disciplines seek to explain with little or no recourse to [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] causation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = TELEOLOGICAL REALISM IN BIOLOGY|url = https://www.academia.edu/6927336|website = www.academia.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> They can be offered to explain the origins of human nature and its underlying mechanisms, or to demonstrate capacities for change and diversity which would arguably violate the concept of a fixed human nature.\nGOD HAS BEEN CREATE HUMAN NATURE BUT MOST OF US HAVE TO BE A NATURE OF THIS GOD OWN,CIVILIZATION IS ACT OF ACT.GOD IS ACT OF CIVILIZATION TO GET PEOPLE ARE BEING MADE TO ORDER OF PREFERENCE FOR LIFE.\n\n==Classical Greek philosophy==\n{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy#Classical Greek philosophy}}\nPhilosophy in [[classical Greece]] is the ultimate origin{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} of the [[Western world|Western]] conception of the nature of a thing. According to [[Aristotle]], the philosophical study of human nature itself originated with [[Socrates]], who turned philosophy from study of the heavens to study of the human things.<ref>Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''</ref> Socrates is said to have studied the question of how a person should best live, but he left no written works. It is clear from the works of his students [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], and also by what was said about him by Aristotle (Plato's student), that Socrates was a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed that the best life and the life most suited to human nature involved [[reason]]ing. The Socratic school was the dominant surviving influence in philosophical discussion in the [[Middle Ages]], amongst [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], and [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]].\n\nThe human [[soul]] in the works of Plato and Aristotle has a divided nature, divided in a specifically human way. One part is specifically human and rational, and divided into a part which is rational on its own, and a spirited part which can understand reason. Other parts of the soul are home to desires or passions similar to those found in animals. In both Aristotle and Plato, spiritedness (''thumos'') is distinguished from the other passions (''epithumiai'').<ref>Aristotle ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' Book I and VI; Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Book IV.</ref> The proper function of the \"rational\" was to rule the other parts of the soul, helped by spiritedness. By this account, using one's reason is the best way to live, and philosophers are the highest types of humans.\n\nAristotle\u2014Plato's most famous student\u2014made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature. In his works, apart from using a similar scheme of a divided human soul, some clear statements about human nature are made:\n* Man is a conjugal animal, meaning an animal which is born to couple when an adult, thus building a household (''oikos'') and, in more successful cases, a clan or small village still run upon patriarchal lines.<ref>Aristotle, [[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1162a 1162a]; [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0058 1252a].</ref>\n* Man is a political animal, meaning an animal with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities the size of a city or town, with a [[division of labor]] and law-making. This type of community is different in kind from a large family, and requires the special use of human reason.<ref>Aristotle, [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1252b 1252b].</ref>\n* Man is a [[Mimesis|mimetic]] animal. Man loves to use his imagination (and not only to make laws and run town councils). He says \"we enjoy looking at accurate likenesses of things which are themselves painful to see, obscene beasts, for instance, and corpses.\" And the \"reason why we enjoy seeing likenesses is that, as we look, we learn and infer what each is, for instance, 'that is so and so.{{'\"}}<ref>Aristotle, ''[[Poetics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448b 1148b].</ref>\n\nFor Aristotle, reason is not only what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, but it is also what we were meant to achieve at our best. Much of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today. However, the particular teleological idea that humans are \"meant\" or intended to be something has become much less popular in [[modern history|modern times]].<ref>Aristotle, The Politics of Aristotle: With an Introduction, Two Prefactory Essays and Notes Critical and Explanatory, Clarendon Press, 1887, Pg. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\nFor the Socratics, human nature, and all natures, are metaphysical concepts. Aristotle developed the standard presentation of this approach with his theory of [[four causes]]. Every living thing exhibits four aspects or \"causes\": matter, form, effect, and end. For example, an oak tree is made of plant cells (matter), grew from an acorn (effect), exhibits the nature of oak trees (form), and grows into a fully mature oak tree (end). Human nature is an example of a formal cause, according to Aristotle. Likewise, to become a fully actualized human being (including fully actualizing the mind) is our end. Aristotle (''Nicomachean Ethics,'' Book X) suggests that the human intellect (\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2) is \"smallest in bulk\" but the most significant part of the human psyche, and should be cultivated above all else. The cultivation of learning and intellectual growth of the philosopher, which is thereby also the happiest and least painful life.\n\n== Chinese philosophy ==\n===Confucianism===\n[[File:Half Portraits of the Great Sage and Virtuous Men of Old - Meng Ke (\u5b5f\u8efb).jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Mencius]], a Confucian philosopher]]\nHuman nature is a central question in [[Chinese philosophy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tang, Paul C.; Basafa, N.

Bacon sometimes wrote as if he accepted the traditional four causes (\"It is a correct position that \"true knowledge is knowledge by causes\". And causes again are not improperly distributed into four kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final\") but he adapted these terms and rejected one of the three: <blockquote>But of these the final cause rather corrupts than advances the sciences, except such as have to do with human action. The discovery of the formal is despaired of. The efficient and the material (as they are investigated and received, that is, as remote causes, without reference to the latent process leading to the form) are but slight and superficial, and contribute little, if anything, to true and active science.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Francis Bacon: Novum Organum (1620)|url = http://www.constitution.org/bacon/nov_org.htm|website = www.constitution.org|access-date = 2016-02-23|pages = Book II, Section II}}</ref></blockquote>This line of thinking continued with [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], whose new approach returned philosophy or science to its [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] focus upon non-human things. [[Thomas Hobbes]], then [[Giambattista Vico]], and [[David Hume]] all claimed to be the first to properly use a modern Baconian scientific approach to human things.\n\nHobbes famously followed Descartes in describing humanity as matter in motion, just like machines. He also very influentially described man's natural state (without science and artifice) as one where life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\".<ref>Hobbes, Thomas, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', XIII.9</ref> Following him, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[empiricism]] also saw human nature as a ''[[tabula rasa]]''. In this view, the mind is at birth a \"blank slate\" without rules, so data are added, and rules for processing them are formed solely by our sensory experiences.<ref>Locke, John, ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', Kenneth P. Winkler (ed.), Hackett Publishing Company, Indianapolis, IN, 1996, pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] pushed the approach of Hobbes to an extreme and criticized it at the same time. He was a contemporary and acquaintance of Hume, writing before the [[French Revolution]] and long before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. He shocked [[Western culture|Western civilization]] with his [[Second Discourse]] by proposing that humans had once been solitary animals, without reason or language or communities, and had developed these things due to accidents of pre-history. (This proposal was also less famously made by Giambattista Vico.) In other words, Rousseau argued that human nature was not only not fixed, but not even approximately fixed compared to what had been assumed before him. Humans are political, and rational, and have language now, but originally they had none of these things.<ref>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, ''The Social Contract'', Translated by Maurice Cranston, Published by Penguin Classics, 1968, {{ISBN|0-14-044201-4}}, pg. 136</ref> This in turn implied that living under the management of human reason might not be a happy way to live at all, and perhaps there is no ideal way to live. Rousseau is also unusual in the extent to which he took the approach of Hobbes, asserting that primitive humans were not even naturally social. A civilized human is therefore not only imbalanced and unhappy because of the mismatch between civilized life and human nature, but unlike Hobbes, Rousseau also became well known for the suggestion that primitive humans had been happier, \"[[noble savage]]s\".<ref>{{Citation |last=Velkley |first=Richard |title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question |year=2002 |publisher= University of Chicago Press}}</ref>\n\nRousseau's conception of human nature has been seen as the origin of many intellectual and political developments of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>Delaney, James, Rousseau and the Ethics of Virtue, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8264-8724-6}}, pg. 49\u201352</ref> He was an important influence upon [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], and [[Marx]], and the development of [[German idealism]], [[historicism]], and [[romanticism]].\n\nWhat human nature did entail, according to Rousseau and the other modernists of the 17th and 18th centuries, were animal-like passions that led humanity to develop language and reasoning, and more complex communities (or communities of any kind, according to Rousseau).\n\nIn contrast to Rousseau, David Hume was a critic of the oversimplifying and systematic approach of Hobbes, Rousseau, and some others whereby, for example, all human nature is assumed to be driven by variations of selfishness. Influenced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], he argued against oversimplification. On the one hand, he accepted that, for many political and economic subjects, people could be assumed to be driven by such simple selfishness, and he also wrote of some of the more social aspects of \"human nature\" as something which could be destroyed, for example if people did not associate in just societies. On the other hand, he rejected what he called the \"paradox of the sceptics\", saying that no politician could have invented words like {{\"'}}honourable' and 'shameful,' 'lovely' and 'odious,' 'noble' and 'despicable{{'\"}}, unless there was not some natural \"original constitution of the mind\".<ref name=humeENQ>[http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/humemora.pdf An Enquiry into the Sources of Morals] Section 5.1</ref>\n\nHume\u2014like Rousseau\u2014was controversial in his own time for his modernist approach, following the example of Bacon and Hobbes, of avoiding consideration of metaphysical explanations for any type of cause and effect. He was accused of being an [[Atheism|atheist]]. He wrote: {{quote|We needn't push our researches so far as to ask \"Why do we have humanity, i.e. a fellow-feeling with others?\" It's enough that we experience this as a force in human nature. Our examination of causes must stop somewhere.<ref name=humeENQ/>}}\n\nAfter Rousseau and Hume, the nature of philosophy and science changed, branching into different disciplines and approaches, and the study of human nature changed accordingly. Rousseau's proposal that human nature is malleable became a major influence upon international revolutionary movements of various kinds, while Hume's approach has been more typical in Anglo-Saxon countries, including the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAccording to Edouard Machery, the concept of human nature is an outgrowth of [[folk biology]] and in particular, the concept of folk essentialism - the tendency of ordinary people to ascribe essences to kinds. Machery argues that while the idea that humans have an \"essence\" is a very old idea, the idea that all humans have a unified human nature is relatively modern; for a long time, people thought of humans as \"us versus them\" and thus did not think of human beings as a unified kind.<ref>Fuentes, Agust\u00edn, and Aku Visala.

Conversely, defenders of the concept argue that when defined in certain ways, human nature is both scientifically respectable and meaningful.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> Therefore, the value and usefulness of the concept depends essentially on how one construes it. This section summarizes the prominent construals of human nature and outlines the key arguments from philosophers on both sides of the debate.\n\n=== Criticism of the concept of human nature ===\nPhilosopher of science [[David Hull|David L. Hull]] has influentially argued that there is no such thing as human nature. Hull's criticism is raised against philosophers who conceive human nature as a set of intrinsic [[phenotypic trait]]s (or [[Character (biology)|characters]]) that are universal among humans, unique to humans, and definitive of what it is to be a member of the biological species ''[[Homo sapiens]].'' In particular, Hull argues that such \"essential sameness of human beings\" is \"temporary, contingent and relatively rare\" in biology.<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\" /> He argues that variation, insofar as it is the result of evolution, is an essential feature of all biological species. Moreover, the type of variation which characterizes a certain species in a certain historical moment is \"to a large extent accidental\".<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\" /> He writes:<blockquote>Periodically a biological species might be characterized by one or more characters which are both universally distributed among and limited to the organisms belonging to that species, but such states of affairs are temporary, contingent and relatively rare.''<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\"/>{{rp|3}}''</blockquote>Hull reasons that properties universally shared by all members of a certain species are usually also possessed by members of other species, whereas properties exclusively possessed by the members of a certain species are rarely possessed by ''all'' members of that species. For these reasons, Hull observes that, in contemporary [[evolutionary taxonomy]], belonging to a particular species does not depend on the possession of any specific intrinsic properties. Rather, it depends on standing in the right kind of relations (relations of [[genealogy]] or interbreeding, depending on the precise [[species concept]] being used) to other members of the species. Consequently, there can be no ''intrinsic'' properties that define what it is to be a member of the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Individual organisms, including humans, are part of a species by virtue of their relations with other members of the same species, not shared intrinsic properties.\n\nAccording to Hull, the moral significance of his argument lies in its impact on the biologically legitimate basis for the concept of \"human rights\". While it has long been argued that there is a sound basis for \"human rights\" in the idea that all human beings are essentially the same, should Hull's criticism work, such a basis \u2013 at least on a biological level \u2013 would disappear. Nevertheless, Hull does not perceive this to be a fundamental for human rights, because people can choose to continue respecting human rights even without sharing the same human nature.<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\" />\n\n=== Defences of the concept of human nature ===\nSeveral contemporary philosophers have attempted to defend the notion of human nature against charges that it is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology by proposing alternative interpretations. They claim that the concept of human nature continues to bear relevance in the fields of [[neuroscience]] and [[biology]]. Many have proposed non-essentialist notions. Others have argued that, even if Darwinism has shown that any attempt to base species membership on \"''intrinsic'' essential properties\" is untenable, essences can still be \"relational\" \u2013 this would be consistent with the interbreeding, ecological, and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] species concepts, which are accepted by modern [[evolutionary biology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okasha|first=Samir|date=2002|title=Darwinian Metaphysics: Species and the Question of Essentialism|url=|journal=Synthese|volume=131|issue=2|pages=191\u2013213|doi=10.1023/A:1015731831011}}</ref> These attempts aim to make Darwinism compatible with a certain conception of human nature which is stable across time.\n\n==== Machery's \"nomological\" account ====\nPhilosopher of science [[Edouard Machery]] has proposed that the above criticisms only apply to a specific definition (or \"notion\") of human nature, and not to \"human nature in general\".<ref name=\":0\" /> He distinguishes between two different notions:\n\n* An '''essentialist''' notion of human nature - \"Human nature is the set of properties that are separately necessary and jointly sufficient for being a human\". These properties are also usually considered as ''distinctive'' of human beings. They are also intrinsic to humans and inherent to their essence.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Machery|first=Edouard|date=June 2008|title=A Plea for Human Nature|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=321\u2013329|doi=10.1080/09515080802170119|issn=0951-5089}}</ref>\n* A '''nomological''' notion of human nature - \"Human nature is the set of properties that humans tend to possess as a result of the evolution of their species\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMachery clarifies that, to count as being \"a result of evolution\", a property must have an [[Proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate explanation]] in [[Ernst Mayr]]'s sense. It must be possible to explain the trait as the product of evolutionary processes. Importantly, properties can count as part of human nature in the nomological sense even if they are not universal among humans and not unique to humans. In other words, nomological properties need not be necessary nor sufficient for being human. Instead, it is enough that these properties are shared by most humans, as a result of the evolution of their species \u2013 they \"need to be typical\".<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198823650.001.0001/oso-9780198823650-chapter-2|title=Doubling Down on the Nomological Notion of Human Nature|last=Machery|first=Edouard|date=2018-07-19|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=1|doi=10.1093/oso/9780198823650.003.0002|isbn=9780191862267}}</ref> Therefore, human nature in the nomological sense does not define what it is to be a member of the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Examples of properties that count as parts of human nature on the nomological definition include: being [[Bipedalism|bipedal]], having the capacity to speak, having a tendency towards [[Biparentalness|biparental]] investment in children, having fear reactions to unexpected noises.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, since they are the product of evolution, properties belonging to the nomological notion of human nature are not fixed, but they can change over time.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMachery agrees with biologists and others philosophers of biology that the essentialist notion of human nature is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology: we cannot explain membership in the human species by means of a definition or a set of properties. However, he maintains that this does not mean humans have no nature, because we can accept the nomological notion which is not a definitional notion. Therefore, we should think of human nature as the many properties humans have in common as a result of evolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMachery argues that notions of human nature can help explain why that, while cultures are very diverse, there are also many constants across cultures. For Machery, most forms of cultural diversity are in fact diversity on a common theme; for example, Machery observes that the concept of a kinship system is common across cultures but the exact form it takes and the specifics vary between cultures.<ref>Fuentes, A. and Visala, A., 2016. Conversations on human nature. Routledge.</ref>\n\n==== Problems with the nomological account ====\nMachery also highlights potential drawbacks of the nomological account.<ref name=\":0\" /> One is that the nomological notion is a watered-down notion that cannot perform many of the roles that the concept of human nature is expected to perform in science and philosophy. The properties endowed upon humans by the nomological account do not distinguish humans from other animals or define what it is to be human. Machery pre-empts this objection by claiming that the nomological concept of human nature still fulfils many roles. He highlights the importance of a conception which picks out what humans share in common which can be used to make scientific, psychological generalizations about human-beings.<ref name=\":7\" /> One advantage of such a conception is that it gives an idea of the traits displayed by the majority of human beings which can be explained in evolutionary terms.\n\nAnother potential drawback is that the nomological account of human nature threatens to lead to the absurd conclusion that all properties of humans are parts of human nature. According to the nomological account, a trait is only part of human nature if it is a result of evolution. However, there is a sense in which all human traits are results of evolution. For example, the belief that water is wet is shared by all humans. However, this belief is only possible because we have, for example, evolved a sense of touch. It is difficult to separate traits which are the result of evolution and those which are not. Machery claims the distinction between [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate and ultimate explanation]] can do the work here: only some human traits can be given an ultimate explanation, he argues.\n\nAccording to the philosopher Richard Samuels<ref name=\":2\" /> the account of human nature is expected to fulfill the five following roles:\n\n* an '''organizing''' function that demarks a territory of scientific inquiry\n* a '''descriptive''' function that is traditionally understood as specifying properties that are universal across and unique to human being\n* a '''causal explanatory''' function that offers causal explanation for occurring human behaviours and features\n* a '''taxonomic''' function that specifies possessing human nature as a necessary and sufficient criterion for belonging to the human species\n* '''Invariances''' that assume the understanding that human nature is to some degree fixed, invariable or at least hard to change and stable across time.\n\nSamuels objects that Machery's nomological account fails to deliver on the causal explanatory function, because it claims that superficial and co-varying properties ''are'' the essence of human nature. Thus, human nature cannot be the underlying ''cause'' of these properties and accordingly cannot fulfill its causal explanatory role.\n\nPhilosopher [[Grant Ramsey]] also rejects Machery's nomological account. For him, defining human nature with respect to only universal traits fails to capture many important human characteristics.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Ramsey |first=Grant |date=December 2013 |title=Human Nature in a Post-essentialist World |journal=Philosophy of Science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271651973 |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=983\u2013993 |doi=10.1086/673902 |issn=0031-8248 |via=ResearchGate |access-date=2019-01-21|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.7085 }}</ref> Ramsey quotes the anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], who claims that \"the notion that unless a cultural phenomenon is empirically universal it cannot reflect anything about the nature of man is about as logical as the notion that because [[Sickle cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]] is, fortunately, not universal, it cannot tell us anything about human genetic processes. It is not whether phenomena are empirically common that is critical in science...but whether they can be made to reveal the enduring natural processes that underly them\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Basic Books|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=44}}</ref> Following Geertz, Ramsey holds that the study of human nature should not rely exclusively on universal or near-universal traits. There are many idiosyncratic and particular traits of scientific interest. Machery's account of human nature cannot give an account to such differences between men and women as the nomological account only picks out the common features within a species. In this light, the female menstrual cycle which is a biologically an essential and useful feature cannot be included in a nomological account of human nature.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nRamsey<ref name=\":1\"/> also objects that Machery uncritically adopts the [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate-acquired dichotomy]], distinguishing between human properties due to enculturation and those due to evolution. Ramsey objects that human properties do not just fall in one of the two categories, writing that \"any organismic property is going to be due to both heritable features of the organism as well as the particular environmental features the organism happens to encounter during its life.\"<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==== Samuels' \"causal essentialist\" account ====\nRichard Samuels (in his article ''Science and Human Nature'') proposes a causal essentialist view that \"human nature should be identified with a suite of mechanisms, processes, and structures that causally explain many of the more superficial properties and regularities reliably associated with humanity\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Richard|date=2012|title=Science and Human Nature|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SAMSAH|journal=Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement|volume=70|issue=4887|pages=587\u2013588|via=PhilPapers|doi=10.1017/S1358246112000021|pmc=2079588}}</ref> This view is \"causal\" because the mechanisms [[Causality|causally explain]] the superficial properties reliably associated with humanity by referencing the underlying causal structures the properties belong to. For example, it is true that the belief that water is wet is shared by all humans yet it is not in itself a significant aspect of human nature. Instead, the psychological process that lead us to assign the word \"wetness\" to water is a universal trait shared by all human beings. In this respect, the superficial belief that water is wet reveals an important causal psychological process which is widely shared by most human beings. The explanation is also \"[[Essentialism|essentialist]]\" because there is a core set of empirically discoverable cognitive mechanism that count as part of the human nature. According to Samuels, his view avoids the standard biological objections to human nature essentialism.\n\nSamuels argues that the theoretical roles of human nature includes: organizing role, descriptive functions, causal explanatory functions, taxonomic functions, and invariances.\n\nIn comparison with traditional essentialist view, the \"causal essentialist\" view does not accomplish the taxonomic role of human nature (the role of defining what it is to be human). He claims however, that no conception could achieve this, as the fulfillment of the role would not survive evolutionary biologists\u2019 objections (articulated above by in \"Criticisms of the concept of human nature\"). In comparison with Machery's nomological conception, Samuels wants to restore the causal-explanatory function of human nature. He defines the essence of human nature as causal mechanisms and not as surface-level properties. For instance, on this view, linguistic behaviour is not part of human nature, but the cognitive mechanisms underpinning linguistic behaviour might count as part of human nature.\n\n==== Ramsey's \"life-history trait cluster\" account ====\nGrant Ramsey proposes an alternative account of human nature, which he names the \"life-history trait cluster\" account.<ref name=\":1\"/> This view stems from the recognition that the combination of a specific genetic constitution with a specific environment is not sufficient to determine how a life will go, i.e., whether one is rich, poor, dies old, dies young, etc. Many \u2018life histories\u2019 are possible for a given individual, each populated by a great number of traits. Ramsey defines his conception of\u00a0human nature in reference to the \u201cpattern of trait clusters within the totality of extant possible life-histories\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In other words, there are certain life histories, i.e., possible routes one's life can take, for example: being rich, being a PhD student, or getting ill. Ramsey underlines the patterns behind these possible routes by delving into the causes of these life histories. For example, one can make the following claim: \u201cHumans sweat when they get exhausted\" or one can also propose neurological claims such as \u201cHumans secrete Adrenaline when they are in flight-fight mode.\u201d This approach enables Ramsey to go beyond the superficial appearances and understand the similarities/differences between individuals in a deeper level which refers to the causal mechanisms (processes, structures and constraints etc.) which lie beneath them. Once we list all the possible life-histories of an individual, we can find these causal patterns and add them together to form the basis of individual nature.\n\nRamsey's next argumentative manoeuvre is to point out that traits are not randomly scattered across potential life histories; there are patterns. \u201cThese patterns\u201d he states \u201cprovide the basis for the notion of individual and human nature\u201d.<ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|987}} While one's \u2018individual nature\u2019 consists of the pattern of trait clusters distributed across that individual's set of possible life histories, Human Nature, Ramsey defines as \u201cthe pattern of trait clusters within the totality of extant human possible life histories\u201d.<ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|987}} Thus, if we were to combine all possible life histories of all individuals in existence we would have access to the trait distribution patterns that constitute human nature.\n\nTrait patterns, on Ramsey's account, can be captured in the form of [[conditional sentence|conditional statements]], such as \"if female, you develop [[Ovary|ovaries]]\" or \"if male, you develop [[Testicle|testes]]\". These statements will not be true of all humans. Ramsey contends that these statements capture part of human nature if they have a good balance of ''pervasiveness'' (many people satisfy the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of the conditional statement), and ''robustness'' (many people who satisfy the antecedent go on to satisfy the [[consequent]]).\n\n=== Human nature and human enhancement ===\n{{Main|Bioconservatism}} {{Main|Transhumanism}}\nThe contemporary debate between so-called \u201c[[Bioconservatism|bioconservatives]]\u201d and \u201c[[Transhumanism|transhumanists]]\u201d is directly related to the concept of human nature: transhumanists argue that \"current human nature is improvable through the use of applied science and other rational methods\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Bioconservatives believe that the costs outweigh the benefits: in particular, they present their position as a defense of human nature which, according to them, is threatened by human enhancement technologies. Although this debate is mainly of an ethical kind, it is deeply rooted in the different interpretations of human nature, human freedom, and human dignity (which, according to bioconservatives, is specific to human beings, while transhumanists think that it can be possessed also by posthumans). As explained by [[Allen Buchanan]],<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Allen|date=2009|title=Human nature and enhancement|url=|journal=Bioethics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=141\u2013150|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00633.x|pmid=19161567}}</ref> the literature against human enhancement is characterized by two main concerns: that \"enhancement may alter or destroy human nature\" and that \"if enhancement alters or destroys human nature, this will undercut our ability to ascertain the good\", as \"the good is determined by our nature\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBioconservatives include [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Future of Human Nature|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Leon Kass]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass|first=Leon|date=2003|title=Happy Souls: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Perfection |url=|journal=The New Atlantis|volume=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> [[Francis Fukuyama]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> and [[Bill McKibben]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date=2005 |title=In Defense of Posthuman Dignity|url=|journal=Bioethics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=202\u201314|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x |pmid=16167401 }}</ref> Some of the reasons why they oppose (certain forms of) human enhancement technology are to be found in the worry that such technology would be \u201cdehumanizing\u201d (as they would undermine the human dignity intrinsically built in our human nature).

His argument is two-folded: The most immediate threat is on the \u201cethical freedom\u201d of programmed individuals, and the subsequent threat is on the viability of liberal democracy. Reasoning of the former can be formulated as the following: [[Genetic programming]] of desirable traits, capabilities and dispositions puts restrictions on a person's freedom to choose a life of his own, to be the ''sole author'' of his existence. A genetically-programmed child may feel ''alienated'' from his identity, which is now irreversibly co-written by human agents other than himself. This feeling of alienation, resulted from\u201ccontingency of a life's beginning that is not at [one's] disposal,\u201d makes it difficult for genetically-modified persons to perceive themselves as [[Moral agency|moral agents]] who can make ethical judgement freely and independently - that is, without any substantial or definitive interference from another agent. Habermas proposes a second threat - the undermining power of genetic programming on the viability of democracy. The basis of [[liberal democracy]], Habermas rightfully claims, is the symmetrical and independent mutual recognition among free, equal and autonomous persons. Genetic programming jeopardizes this condition by irreversibly subjecting children to permanent dependence on their parents, thus depriving them of their ''perceived'' ability to be full citizens of the legal community. This fundamental modification to human relationship erodes the foundation of liberal democracy and puts its viability in danger.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Future of Human Nature|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=60\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous proponent of transhumanism, on the other hand, is [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]]. According to Bostrom, \"human enhancement technologies should be made widely available\",<ref name=\":3\" /> as they would offer enormous potential for improving the lives of human beings, without  \"dehumanizing\" them: for instance, improving their intellectual and physical capacities, or protecting them from suffering, illnesses, aging, and physical and cognitive shortcomings.<ref name=\":3\" /> In response to bioconservatives, transhumanists argue that expanding a person's \"capability set\" would increase her freedom of choice, rather than reducing it.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[Allen Buchanan]] has questioned the relevance of the concept of human nature to this debate. In \"Human Nature and Enhancement\", he argued that good but also bad characteristics are part of human nature, and that changing the \"bad\" ones does not necessarily imply that the \"good\" ones will be affected. Moreover, Buchanan argued that the way we evaluate the good is independent of human nature: in fact, we can \"make coherent judgements about the defective aspects of human nature, and if those defects were readied this need not affect our ability to judge what is good\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Buchanan's conclusion is that the debate on enhancement of human beings would be more fruitful if it was conducted without appealing to the concept of human nature.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Tim Lewens]] presented a similar position: since the only notions of human nature which are compatible with biology offer \"no ethical guidance in debates over enhancement\", we should set the concept of human nature aside when debating about enhancement. On the other hand, \"folk\", neo-Aristotelian conceptions of human nature seem to have normative implications, but they have no basis in scientific research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewens|first=Tim|date=2012|title=Human Nature: The Very Idea|url=|journal=Philosophy & Technology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=459\u2013474|doi=10.1007/s13347-012-0063-x}}</ref> Grant Ramsey replied to these claims, arguing that his \"life-history trait cluster\" account allows the concept of human nature \"to inform questions of human enhancement\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=Grant|date=2012|title=How Human Nature Can Inform Human Enhancement: a Commentary on Tim Lewens's Human Nature: the Very Idea|url=|journal=Philosophy and Technology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=479\u2013483|doi=10.1007/s13347-012-0087-2}}</ref>\n\nAppeals to nature often fall foul of the [[naturalistic fallacy]], whereby certain capacities or traits are considered morally 'good' in virtue of their ''naturalness.'' The fallacy was initially introduced by [[G. E. Moore|G E Moore]] in 1903, who challenged philosopher's attempts to define ''good'' reductively, in terms of natural properties (such as ''desirable''). Reliance on 'the natural' as a justification for resisting enhancement is criticised on several grounds by transhumanists, against the bioconservative motivation to preserve or protect 'human nature'.\n\nFor example, Nick Bostrom asserts \"had Mother Nature been a real parent, she would have been in jail for child abuse and murder\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=June 2005|journal=Bioethics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=202\u2013214|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x|issn=0269-9702|title=In Defense of Posthuman Dignity|pmid=16167401}}</ref> thus not worthy of unqualified protection.\n\nSimilarly, [[Arthur Caplan]] opposes naturalistic objections to [[life extension]] enhancements, by claiming that:\n\n\"The explanation of why ageing occurs has many of the attributes of a stochastic or chance phenomenon.

By this account, human nature really causes humans to become what they become, and so it exists somehow independently of individuals. This in turn has been understood as also showing a special connection between human nature and [[divinity]]. This approach understands human nature in terms of [[final cause|final]] and [[formal cause|formal]] [[Causality|causes]]. In other words, nature itself (or a nature-creating divinity) has intentions and goals, similar somehow to human intentions and goals, and one of those goals is humanity living naturally. Such understandings of human nature see this nature as an \"idea\", or \"[[Theory of Forms|form]]\" of a human.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D13%3Asection%3D1078b 1078b].</ref>\n\nHowever, the existence of this invariable and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] human nature is subject of much historical debate, continuing into modern times. Against this idea of a fixed human nature, the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries\u2014firstly by early modernists such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

Still more recent scientific perspectives\u2014such as [[behaviorism]], [[determinism]], and the chemical model within modern [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]]\u2014claim to be neutral regarding human nature.

According to [[Aristotle]], the philosophical study of human nature itself originated with [[Socrates]], who turned philosophy from study of the heavens to study of the human things.<ref>Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''</ref> Socrates is said to have studied the question of how a person should best live, but he left no written works. It is clear from the works of his students [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], and also by what was said about him by Aristotle (Plato's student), that Socrates was a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed that the best life and the life most suited to human nature involved [[reason]]ing. The Socratic school was the dominant surviving influence in philosophical discussion in the [[Middle Ages]], amongst [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], and [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]].\n\nThe human [[soul]] in the works of Plato and Aristotle has a divided nature, divided in a specifically human way. One part is specifically human and rational, and divided into a part which is rational on its own, and a spirited part which can understand reason. Other parts of the soul are home to desires or passions similar to those found in animals. In both Aristotle and Plato, spiritedness (''thumos'') is distinguished from the other passions (''epithumiai'').<ref>Aristotle ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' Book I and VI; Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Book IV.</ref> The proper function of the \"rational\" was to rule the other parts of the soul, helped by spiritedness. By this account, using one's reason is the best way to live, and philosophers are the highest types of humans.\n\nAristotle\u2014Plato's most famous student\u2014made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature. In his works, apart from using a similar scheme of a divided human soul, some clear statements about human nature are made:\n* Man is a conjugal animal, meaning an animal which is born to couple when an adult, thus building a household (''oikos'') and, in more successful cases, a clan or small village still run upon patriarchal lines.<ref>Aristotle, [[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1162a 1162a]; [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0058 1252a].</ref>\n* Man is a political animal, meaning an animal with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities the size of a city or town, with a [[division of labor]] and law-making. This type of community is different in kind from a large family, and requires the special use of human reason.<ref>Aristotle, [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1252b 1252b].</ref>\n* Man is a [[Mimesis|mimetic]] animal. Man loves to use his imagination (and not only to make laws and run town councils). He says \"we enjoy looking at accurate likenesses of things which are themselves painful to see, obscene beasts, for instance, and corpses.\" And the \"reason why we enjoy seeing likenesses is that, as we look, we learn and infer what each is, for instance, 'that is so and so.{{'\"}}<ref>Aristotle, ''[[Poetics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448b 1148b].</ref>\n\nFor Aristotle, reason is not only what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, but it is also what we were meant to achieve at our best. Much of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today. However, the particular teleological idea that humans are \"meant\" or intended to be something has become much less popular in [[modern history|modern times]].<ref>Aristotle, The Politics of Aristotle: With an Introduction, Two Prefactory Essays and Notes Critical and Explanatory, Clarendon Press, 1887, Pg. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\nFor the Socratics, human nature, and all natures, are metaphysical concepts. Aristotle developed the standard presentation of this approach with his theory of [[four causes]]. Every living thing exhibits four aspects or \"causes\": matter, form, effect, and end. For example, an oak tree is made of plant cells (matter), grew from an acorn (effect), exhibits the nature of oak trees (form), and grows into a fully mature oak tree (end). Human nature is an example of a formal cause, according to Aristotle. Likewise, to become a fully actualized human being (including fully actualizing the mind) is our end. Aristotle (''Nicomachean Ethics,'' Book X) suggests that the human intellect (\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2) is \"smallest in bulk\" but the most significant part of the human psyche, and should be cultivated above all else. The cultivation of learning and intellectual growth of the philosopher, which is thereby also the happiest and least painful life.\n\n== Chinese philosophy ==\n===Confucianism===\n[[File:Half Portraits of the Great Sage and Virtuous Men of Old - Meng Ke (\u5b5f\u8efb).jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Mencius]], a Confucian philosopher]]\nHuman nature is a central question in [[Chinese philosophy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tang, Paul C.; Basafa, N.

Bacon sometimes wrote as if he accepted the traditional four causes (\"It is a correct position that \"true knowledge is knowledge by causes\". And causes again are not improperly distributed into four kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final\") but he adapted these terms and rejected one of the three: <blockquote>But of these the final cause rather corrupts than advances the sciences, except such as have to do with human action. The discovery of the formal is despaired of. The efficient and the material (as they are investigated and received, that is, as remote causes, without reference to the latent process leading to the form) are but slight and superficial, and contribute little, if anything, to true and active science.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Francis Bacon: Novum Organum (1620)|url = http://www.constitution.org/bacon/nov_org.htm|website = www.constitution.org|access-date = 2016-02-23|pages = Book II, Section II}}</ref></blockquote>This line of thinking continued with [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], whose new approach returned philosophy or science to its [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] focus upon non-human things. [[Thomas Hobbes]], then [[Giambattista Vico]], and [[David Hume]] all claimed to be the first to properly use a modern Baconian scientific approach to human things.\n\nHobbes famously followed Descartes in describing humanity as matter in motion, just like machines. He also very influentially described man's natural state (without science and artifice) as one where life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\".<ref>Hobbes, Thomas, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', XIII.9</ref> Following him, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[empiricism]] also saw human nature as a ''[[tabula rasa]]''. In this view, the mind is at birth a \"blank slate\" without rules, so data are added, and rules for processing them are formed solely by our sensory experiences.<ref>Locke, John, ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', Kenneth P. Winkler (ed.), Hackett Publishing Company, Indianapolis, IN, 1996, pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] pushed the approach of Hobbes to an extreme and criticized it at the same time. He was a contemporary and acquaintance of Hume, writing before the [[French Revolution]] and long before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. He shocked [[Western culture|Western civilization]] with his [[Second Discourse]] by proposing that humans had once been solitary animals, without reason or language or communities, and had developed these things due to accidents of pre-history. (This proposal was also less famously made by Giambattista Vico.) In other words, Rousseau argued that human nature was not only not fixed, but not even approximately fixed compared to what had been assumed before him. Humans are political, and rational, and have language now, but originally they had none of these things.<ref>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, ''The Social Contract'', Translated by Maurice Cranston, Published by Penguin Classics, 1968, {{ISBN|0-14-044201-4}}, pg. 136</ref> This in turn implied that living under the management of human reason might not be a happy way to live at all, and perhaps there is no ideal way to live. Rousseau is also unusual in the extent to which he took the approach of Hobbes, asserting that primitive humans were not even naturally social. A civilized human is therefore not only imbalanced and unhappy because of the mismatch between civilized life and human nature, but unlike Hobbes, Rousseau also became well known for the suggestion that primitive humans had been happier, \"[[noble savage]]s\".<ref>{{Citation |last=Velkley |first=Richard |title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question |year=2002 |publisher= University of Chicago Press}}</ref>\n\nRousseau's conception of human nature has been seen as the origin of many intellectual and political developments of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>Delaney, James, Rousseau and the Ethics of Virtue, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8264-8724-6}}, pg. 49\u201352</ref> He was an important influence upon [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], and [[Marx]], and the development of [[German idealism]], [[historicism]], and [[romanticism]].\n\nWhat human nature did entail, according to Rousseau and the other modernists of the 17th and 18th centuries, were animal-like passions that led humanity to develop language and reasoning, and more complex communities (or communities of any kind, according to Rousseau).\n\nIn contrast to Rousseau, David Hume was a critic of the oversimplifying and systematic approach of Hobbes, Rousseau, and some others whereby, for example, all human nature is assumed to be driven by variations of selfishness. Influenced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], he argued against oversimplification. On the one hand, he accepted that, for many political and economic subjects, people could be assumed to be driven by such simple selfishness, and he also wrote of some of the more social aspects of \"human nature\" as something which could be destroyed, for example if people did not associate in just societies. On the other hand, he rejected what he called the \"paradox of the sceptics\", saying that no politician could have invented words like {{\"'}}honourable' and 'shameful,' 'lovely' and 'odious,' 'noble' and 'despicable{{'\"}}, unless there was not some natural \"original constitution of the mind\".<ref name=humeENQ>[http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/humemora.pdf An Enquiry into the Sources of Morals] Section 5.1</ref>\n\nHume\u2014like Rousseau\u2014was controversial in his own time for his modernist approach, following the example of Bacon and Hobbes, of avoiding consideration of metaphysical explanations for any type of cause and effect. He was accused of being an [[Atheism|atheist]]. He wrote: {{quote|We needn't push our researches so far as to ask \"Why do we have humanity, i.e. a fellow-feeling with others?\" It's enough that we experience this as a force in human nature. Our examination of causes must stop somewhere.<ref name=humeENQ/>}}\n\nAfter Rousseau and Hume, the nature of philosophy and science changed, branching into different disciplines and approaches, and the study of human nature changed accordingly. Rousseau's proposal that human nature is malleable became a major influence upon international revolutionary movements of various kinds, while Hume's approach has been more typical in Anglo-Saxon countries, including the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAccording to Edouard Machery, the concept of human nature is an outgrowth of [[folk biology]] and in particular, the concept of folk essentialism - the tendency of ordinary people to ascribe essences to kinds. Machery argues that while the idea that humans have an \"essence\" is a very old idea, the idea that all humans have a unified human nature is relatively modern; for a long time, people thought of humans as \"us versus them\" and thus did not think of human beings as a unified kind.<ref>Fuentes, Agust\u00edn, and Aku Visala.

Conversely, defenders of the concept argue that when defined in certain ways, human nature is both scientifically respectable and meaningful.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> Therefore, the value and usefulness of the concept depends essentially on how one construes it. This section summarizes the prominent construals of human nature and outlines the key arguments from philosophers on both sides of the debate.\n\n=== Criticism of the concept of human nature ===\nPhilosopher of science [[David Hull|David L. Hull]] has influentially argued that there is no such thing as human nature. Hull's criticism is raised against philosophers who conceive human nature as a set of intrinsic [[phenotypic trait]]s (or [[Character (biology)|characters]]) that are universal among humans, unique to humans, and definitive of what it is to be a member of the biological species ''[[Homo sapiens]].'' In particular, Hull argues that such \"essential sameness of human beings\" is \"temporary, contingent and relatively rare\" in biology.<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\" /> He argues that variation, insofar as it is the result of evolution, is an essential feature of all biological species. Moreover, the type of variation which characterizes a certain species in a certain historical moment is \"to a large extent accidental\".<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\" /> He writes:<blockquote>Periodically a biological species might be characterized by one or more characters which are both universally distributed among and limited to the organisms belonging to that species, but such states of affairs are temporary, contingent and relatively rare.''<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\"/>{{rp|3}}''</blockquote>Hull reasons that properties universally shared by all members of a certain species are usually also possessed by members of other species, whereas properties exclusively possessed by the members of a certain species are rarely possessed by ''all'' members of that species. For these reasons, Hull observes that, in contemporary [[evolutionary taxonomy]], belonging to a particular species does not depend on the possession of any specific intrinsic properties. Rather, it depends on standing in the right kind of relations (relations of [[genealogy]] or interbreeding, depending on the precise [[species concept]] being used) to other members of the species. Consequently, there can be no ''intrinsic'' properties that define what it is to be a member of the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Individual organisms, including humans, are part of a species by virtue of their relations with other members of the same species, not shared intrinsic properties.\n\nAccording to Hull, the moral significance of his argument lies in its impact on the biologically legitimate basis for the concept of \"human rights\". While it has long been argued that there is a sound basis for \"human rights\" in the idea that all human beings are essentially the same, should Hull's criticism work, such a basis \u2013 at least on a biological level \u2013 would disappear. Nevertheless, Hull does not perceive this to be a fundamental for human rights, because people can choose to continue respecting human rights even without sharing the same human nature.<ref name=\"Hull 3\u201313\" />\n\n=== Defences of the concept of human nature ===\nSeveral contemporary philosophers have attempted to defend the notion of human nature against charges that it is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology by proposing alternative interpretations. They claim that the concept of human nature continues to bear relevance in the fields of [[neuroscience]] and [[biology]]. Many have proposed non-essentialist notions. Others have argued that, even if Darwinism has shown that any attempt to base species membership on \"''intrinsic'' essential properties\" is untenable, essences can still be \"relational\" \u2013 this would be consistent with the interbreeding, ecological, and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] species concepts, which are accepted by modern [[evolutionary biology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okasha|first=Samir|date=2002|title=Darwinian Metaphysics: Species and the Question of Essentialism|url=|journal=Synthese|volume=131|issue=2|pages=191\u2013213|doi=10.1023/A:1015731831011}}</ref> These attempts aim to make Darwinism compatible with a certain conception of human nature which is stable across time.\n\n==== Machery's \"nomological\" account ====\nPhilosopher of science [[Edouard Machery]] has proposed that the above criticisms only apply to a specific definition (or \"notion\") of human nature, and not to \"human nature in general\".<ref name=\":0\" /> He distinguishes between two different notions:\n\n* An '''essentialist''' notion of human nature - \"Human nature is the set of properties that are separately necessary and jointly sufficient for being a human\". These properties are also usually considered as ''distinctive'' of human beings. They are also intrinsic to humans and inherent to their essence.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Machery|first=Edouard|date=June 2008|title=A Plea for Human Nature|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=321\u2013329|doi=10.1080/09515080802170119|issn=0951-5089}}</ref>\n* A '''nomological''' notion of human nature - \"Human nature is the set of properties that humans tend to possess as a result of the evolution of their species\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMachery clarifies that, to count as being \"a result of evolution\", a property must have an [[Proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate explanation]] in [[Ernst Mayr]]'s sense. It must be possible to explain the trait as the product of evolutionary processes. Importantly, properties can count as part of human nature in the nomological sense even if they are not universal among humans and not unique to humans. In other words, nomological properties need not be necessary nor sufficient for being human. Instead, it is enough that these properties are shared by most humans, as a result of the evolution of their species \u2013 they \"need to be typical\".<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198823650.001.0001/oso-9780198823650-chapter-2|title=Doubling Down on the Nomological Notion of Human Nature|last=Machery|first=Edouard|date=2018-07-19|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=1|doi=10.1093/oso/9780198823650.003.0002|isbn=9780191862267}}</ref> Therefore, human nature in the nomological sense does not define what it is to be a member of the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Examples of properties that count as parts of human nature on the nomological definition include: being [[Bipedalism|bipedal]], having the capacity to speak, having a tendency towards [[Biparentalness|biparental]] investment in children, having fear reactions to unexpected noises.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, since they are the product of evolution, properties belonging to the nomological notion of human nature are not fixed, but they can change over time.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMachery agrees with biologists and others philosophers of biology that the essentialist notion of human nature is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology: we cannot explain membership in the human species by means of a definition or a set of properties. However, he maintains that this does not mean humans have no nature, because we can accept the nomological notion which is not a definitional notion. Therefore, we should think of human nature as the many properties humans have in common as a result of evolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMachery argues that notions of human nature can help explain why that, while cultures are very diverse, there are also many constants across cultures. For Machery, most forms of cultural diversity are in fact diversity on a common theme; for example, Machery observes that the concept of a kinship system is common across cultures but the exact form it takes and the specifics vary between cultures.<ref>Fuentes, A. and Visala, A., 2016. Conversations on human nature. Routledge.</ref>\n\n==== Problems with the nomological account ====\nMachery also highlights potential drawbacks of the nomological account.<ref name=\":0\" /> One is that the nomological notion is a watered-down notion that cannot perform many of the roles that the concept of human nature is expected to perform in science and philosophy. The properties endowed upon humans by the nomological account do not distinguish humans from other animals or define what it is to be human. Machery pre-empts this objection by claiming that the nomological concept of human nature still fulfils many roles. He highlights the importance of a conception which picks out what humans share in common which can be used to make scientific, psychological generalizations about human-beings.<ref name=\":7\" /> One advantage of such a conception is that it gives an idea of the traits displayed by the majority of human beings which can be explained in evolutionary terms.\n\nAnother potential drawback is that the nomological account of human nature threatens to lead to the absurd conclusion that all properties of humans are parts of human nature. According to the nomological account, a trait is only part of human nature if it is a result of evolution. However, there is a sense in which all human traits are results of evolution. For example, the belief that water is wet is shared by all humans. However, this belief is only possible because we have, for example, evolved a sense of touch. It is difficult to separate traits which are the result of evolution and those which are not. Machery claims the distinction between [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate and ultimate explanation]] can do the work here: only some human traits can be given an ultimate explanation, he argues.\n\nAccording to the philosopher Richard Samuels<ref name=\":2\" /> the account of human nature is expected to fulfill the five following roles:\n\n* an '''organizing''' function that demarks a territory of scientific inquiry\n* a '''descriptive''' function that is traditionally understood as specifying properties that are universal across and unique to human being\n* a '''causal explanatory''' function that offers causal explanation for occurring human behaviours and features\n* a '''taxonomic''' function that specifies possessing human nature as a necessary and sufficient criterion for belonging to the human species\n* '''Invariances''' that assume the understanding that human nature is to some degree fixed, invariable or at least hard to change and stable across time.\n\nSamuels objects that Machery's nomological account fails to deliver on the causal explanatory function, because it claims that superficial and co-varying properties ''are'' the essence of human nature. Thus, human nature cannot be the underlying ''cause'' of these properties and accordingly cannot fulfill its causal explanatory role.\n\nPhilosopher [[Grant Ramsey]] also rejects Machery's nomological account. For him, defining human nature with respect to only universal traits fails to capture many important human characteristics.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Ramsey |first=Grant |date=December 2013 |title=Human Nature in a Post-essentialist World |journal=Philosophy of Science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271651973 |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=983\u2013993 |doi=10.1086/673902 |issn=0031-8248 |via=ResearchGate |access-date=2019-01-21|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.7085 }}</ref> Ramsey quotes the anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], who claims that \"the notion that unless a cultural phenomenon is empirically universal it cannot reflect anything about the nature of man is about as logical as the notion that because [[Sickle cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]] is, fortunately, not universal, it cannot tell us anything about human genetic processes. It is not whether phenomena are empirically common that is critical in science...but whether they can be made to reveal the enduring natural processes that underly them\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Basic Books|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=44}}</ref> Following Geertz, Ramsey holds that the study of human nature should not rely exclusively on universal or near-universal traits. There are many idiosyncratic and particular traits of scientific interest. Machery's account of human nature cannot give an account to such differences between men and women as the nomological account only picks out the common features within a species. In this light, the female menstrual cycle which is a biologically an essential and useful feature cannot be included in a nomological account of human nature.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nRamsey<ref name=\":1\"/> also objects that Machery uncritically adopts the [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate-acquired dichotomy]], distinguishing between human properties due to enculturation and those due to evolution. Ramsey objects that human properties do not just fall in one of the two categories, writing that \"any organismic property is going to be due to both heritable features of the organism as well as the particular environmental features the organism happens to encounter during its life.\"<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==== Samuels' \"causal essentialist\" account ====\nRichard Samuels (in his article ''Science and Human Nature'') proposes a causal essentialist view that \"human nature should be identified with a suite of mechanisms, processes, and structures that causally explain many of the more superficial properties and regularities reliably associated with humanity\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Richard|date=2012|title=Science and Human Nature|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SAMSAH|journal=Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement|volume=70|issue=4887|pages=587\u2013588|via=PhilPapers|doi=10.1017/S1358246112000021|pmc=2079588}}</ref> This view is \"causal\" because the mechanisms [[Causality|causally explain]] the superficial properties reliably associated with humanity by referencing the underlying causal structures the properties belong to. For example, it is true that the belief that water is wet is shared by all humans yet it is not in itself a significant aspect of human nature. Instead, the psychological process that lead us to assign the word \"wetness\" to water is a universal trait shared by all human beings. In this respect, the superficial belief that water is wet reveals an important causal psychological process which is widely shared by most human beings. The explanation is also \"[[Essentialism|essentialist]]\" because there is a core set of empirically discoverable cognitive mechanism that count as part of the human nature. According to Samuels, his view avoids the standard biological objections to human nature essentialism.\n\nSamuels argues that the theoretical roles of human nature includes: organizing role, descriptive functions, causal explanatory functions, taxonomic functions, and invariances.\n\nIn comparison with traditional essentialist view, the \"causal essentialist\" view does not accomplish the taxonomic role of human nature (the role of defining what it is to be human). He claims however, that no conception could achieve this, as the fulfillment of the role would not survive evolutionary biologists\u2019 objections (articulated above by in \"Criticisms of the concept of human nature\"). In comparison with Machery's nomological conception, Samuels wants to restore the causal-explanatory function of human nature. He defines the essence of human nature as causal mechanisms and not as surface-level properties. For instance, on this view, linguistic behaviour is not part of human nature, but the cognitive mechanisms underpinning linguistic behaviour might count as part of human nature.\n\n==== Ramsey's \"life-history trait cluster\" account ====\nGrant Ramsey proposes an alternative account of human nature, which he names the \"life-history trait cluster\" account.<ref name=\":1\"/> This view stems from the recognition that the combination of a specific genetic constitution with a specific environment is not sufficient to determine how a life will go, i.e., whether one is rich, poor, dies old, dies young, etc. Many \u2018life histories\u2019 are possible for a given individual, each populated by a great number of traits. Ramsey defines his conception of\u00a0human nature in reference to the \u201cpattern of trait clusters within the totality of extant possible life-histories\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In other words, there are certain life histories, i.e., possible routes one's life can take, for example: being rich, being a PhD student, or getting ill. Ramsey underlines the patterns behind these possible routes by delving into the causes of these life histories. For example, one can make the following claim: \u201cHumans sweat when they get exhausted\" or one can also propose neurological claims such as \u201cHumans secrete Adrenaline when they are in flight-fight mode.\u201d This approach enables Ramsey to go beyond the superficial appearances and understand the similarities/differences between individuals in a deeper level which refers to the causal mechanisms (processes, structures and constraints etc.) which lie beneath them. Once we list all the possible life-histories of an individual, we can find these causal patterns and add them together to form the basis of individual nature.\n\nRamsey's next argumentative manoeuvre is to point out that traits are not randomly scattered across potential life histories; there are patterns. \u201cThese patterns\u201d he states \u201cprovide the basis for the notion of individual and human nature\u201d.<ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|987}} While one's \u2018individual nature\u2019 consists of the pattern of trait clusters distributed across that individual's set of possible life histories, Human Nature, Ramsey defines as \u201cthe pattern of trait clusters within the totality of extant human possible life histories\u201d.<ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|987}} Thus, if we were to combine all possible life histories of all individuals in existence we would have access to the trait distribution patterns that constitute human nature.\n\nTrait patterns, on Ramsey's account, can be captured in the form of [[conditional sentence|conditional statements]], such as \"if female, you develop [[Ovary|ovaries]]\" or \"if male, you develop [[Testicle|testes]]\". These statements will not be true of all humans. Ramsey contends that these statements capture part of human nature if they have a good balance of ''pervasiveness'' (many people satisfy the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of the conditional statement), and ''robustness'' (many people who satisfy the antecedent go on to satisfy the [[consequent]]).\n\n=== Human nature and human enhancement ===\n{{Main|Bioconservatism}} {{Main|Transhumanism}}\nThe contemporary debate between so-called \u201c[[Bioconservatism|bioconservatives]]\u201d and \u201c[[Transhumanism|transhumanists]]\u201d is directly related to the concept of human nature: transhumanists argue that \"current human nature is improvable through the use of applied science and other rational methods\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Bioconservatives believe that the costs outweigh the benefits: in particular, they present their position as a defense of human nature which, according to them, is threatened by human enhancement technologies. Although this debate is mainly of an ethical kind, it is deeply rooted in the different interpretations of human nature, human freedom, and human dignity (which, according to bioconservatives, is specific to human beings, while transhumanists think that it can be possessed also by posthumans). As explained by [[Allen Buchanan]],<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Allen|date=2009|title=Human nature and enhancement|url=|journal=Bioethics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=141\u2013150|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00633.x|pmid=19161567}}</ref> the literature against human enhancement is characterized by two main concerns: that \"enhancement may alter or destroy human nature\" and that \"if enhancement alters or destroys human nature, this will undercut our ability to ascertain the good\", as \"the good is determined by our nature\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBioconservatives include [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Future of Human Nature|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Leon Kass]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass|first=Leon|date=2003|title=Happy Souls: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Perfection |url=|journal=The New Atlantis|volume=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> [[Francis Fukuyama]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> and [[Bill McKibben]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date=2005 |title=In Defense of Posthuman Dignity|url=|journal=Bioethics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=202\u201314|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x |pmid=16167401 }}</ref> Some of the reasons why they oppose (certain forms of) human enhancement technology are to be found in the worry that such technology would be \u201cdehumanizing\u201d (as they would undermine the human dignity intrinsically built in our human nature).

His argument is two-folded: The most immediate threat is on the \u201cethical freedom\u201d of programmed individuals, and the subsequent threat is on the viability of liberal democracy. Reasoning of the former can be formulated as the following: [[Genetic programming]] of desirable traits, capabilities and dispositions puts restrictions on a person's freedom to choose a life of his own, to be the ''sole author'' of his existence. A genetically-programmed child may feel ''alienated'' from his identity, which is now irreversibly co-written by human agents other than himself. This feeling of alienation, resulted from\u201ccontingency of a life's beginning that is not at [one's] disposal,\u201d makes it difficult for genetically-modified persons to perceive themselves as [[Moral agency|moral agents]] who can make ethical judgement freely and independently - that is, without any substantial or definitive interference from another agent. Habermas proposes a second threat - the undermining power of genetic programming on the viability of democracy. The basis of [[liberal democracy]], Habermas rightfully claims, is the symmetrical and independent mutual recognition among free, equal and autonomous persons. Genetic programming jeopardizes this condition by irreversibly subjecting children to permanent dependence on their parents, thus depriving them of their ''perceived'' ability to be full citizens of the legal community. This fundamental modification to human relationship erodes the foundation of liberal democracy and puts its viability in danger.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Future of Human Nature|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=60\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous proponent of transhumanism, on the other hand, is [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]]. According to Bostrom, \"human enhancement technologies should be made widely available\",<ref name=\":3\" /> as they would offer enormous potential for improving the lives of human beings, without  \"dehumanizing\" them: for instance, improving their intellectual and physical capacities, or protecting them from suffering, illnesses, aging, and physical and cognitive shortcomings.<ref name=\":3\" /> In response to bioconservatives, transhumanists argue that expanding a person's \"capability set\" would increase her freedom of choice, rather than reducing it.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[Allen Buchanan]] has questioned the relevance of the concept of human nature to this debate. In \"Human Nature and Enhancement\", he argued that good but also bad characteristics are part of human nature, and that changing the \"bad\" ones does not necessarily imply that the \"good\" ones will be affected. Moreover, Buchanan argued that the way we evaluate the good is independent of human nature: in fact, we can \"make coherent judgements about the defective aspects of human nature, and if those defects were readied this need not affect our ability to judge what is good\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Buchanan's conclusion is that the debate on enhancement of human beings would be more fruitful if it was conducted without appealing to the concept of human nature.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Tim Lewens]] presented a similar position: since the only notions of human nature which are compatible with biology offer \"no ethical guidance in debates over enhancement\", we should set the concept of human nature aside when debating about enhancement. On the other hand, \"folk\", neo-Aristotelian conceptions of human nature seem to have normative implications, but they have no basis in scientific research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewens|first=Tim|date=2012|title=Human Nature: The Very Idea|url=|journal=Philosophy & Technology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=459\u2013474|doi=10.1007/s13347-012-0063-x}}</ref> Grant Ramsey replied to these claims, arguing that his \"life-history trait cluster\" account allows the concept of human nature \"to inform questions of human enhancement\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=Grant|date=2012|title=How Human Nature Can Inform Human Enhancement: a Commentary on Tim Lewens's Human Nature: the Very Idea|url=|journal=Philosophy and Technology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=479\u2013483|doi=10.1007/s13347-012-0087-2}}</ref>\n\nAppeals to nature often fall foul of the [[naturalistic fallacy]], whereby certain capacities or traits are considered morally 'good' in virtue of their ''naturalness.'' The fallacy was initially introduced by [[G. E. Moore|G E Moore]] in 1903, who challenged philosopher's attempts to define ''good'' reductively, in terms of natural properties (such as ''desirable''). Reliance on 'the natural' as a justification for resisting enhancement is criticised on several grounds by transhumanists, against the bioconservative motivation to preserve or protect 'human nature'.\n\nFor example, Nick Bostrom asserts \"had Mother Nature been a real parent, she would have been in jail for child abuse and murder\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=June 2005|journal=Bioethics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=202\u2013214|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x|issn=0269-9702|title=In Defense of Posthuman Dignity|pmid=16167401}}</ref> thus not worthy of unqualified protection.\n\nSimilarly, [[Arthur Caplan]] opposes naturalistic objections to [[life extension]] enhancements, by claiming that:\n\n\"The explanation of why ageing occurs has many of the attributes of a stochastic or chance phenomenon. And this makes ageing unnatural and in no way an intrinsic part of human nature. As such, there is no reason why it is intrinsically wrong to try to reverse or cure ageing.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Caplan|first=Arthur L.|date=2005-07-01|title=Death as an unnatural process: Why is it wrong to seek a cure for ageing?|journal=EMBO Reports|volume=6|issue=S1|pages=S72\u2013S75|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400435|issn=1469-221X|pmid=15995668|pmc=1369280}}</ref>\n\n== Scientific understanding ==\n{{See also|Evolutionary psychology|Instinct#In humans}}\n[[Instinct|Instinctual]] behaviour, an inherent inclination towards a particular complex behaviour, has been observed in humans.

He became active in local politics. Forbes first entered the House of Representatives in 1908 as a member of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], and when that party declined he became the leader of the newly created [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] in 1928. His rise to power as Prime Minister was unexpected, and some believed him unsuited to the post; it was his misfortune to hold office during the very worst period of the [[Great Depression]]. He nevertheless remained in power for five years. Forbes headed the [[United\u2013Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|United\u2013Reform coalition Government]] that eventually became the modern [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\nOften referred to as \"Honest George\", Forbes had a reputation for probity, rare debating skill, and impressive memory. His courteous and friendly attitude earned him the liking and respect of parliamentarians from all sides of the House.  Throughout his time in national politics his [[Hurunui (New Zealand electorate)|Hurunui]] constituents held Forbes in high regard: even when Prime Minister he would roll up his sleeves and help load sheep from his farm on the railway wagons for market.\n\n==Early life==\nForbes was born in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], just outside the city of [[Christchurch]]. He gained his education at [[Christchurch Boys' High School]] in Christchurch, and did not attend university. He became known for his ability at sport, particularly in athletics, [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], and [[rugby football|rugby]] where he captained the Canterbury team.

He stood as an independent, having failed to gain the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] nomination. He lost the election. At the {{NZ election link|1908}}, however, he became the Liberal Party's official Hurunui candidate, and won the seat of Hurunui. He would hold this seat for thirty-five years.\n\nForbes remained a [[backbencher]] for some time, but became the Liberal Party's [[Senior Whip of the Liberal Party|Whip]] when party leader [[Thomas Mackenzie]] became Prime Minister in March 1912. He retained this position when his party went into [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] on 10 July 1912. However, he had considerably higher status within the party than his official responsibilities indicated, although few thought of him as a potential leader.\n\nBy the early 1920s, the Liberal Party faced a decision as to its political future. The [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]] government of [[William Massey]] dominated the political scene, having secured the conservative vote, while the growing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] had started to undermine Liberal's progressive voter-base. Many members of the Liberal Party believed an alliance with the Reform Party inevitable, seeing such co-operation as necessary to counteract the \"radicalism\" of the Labour Party. When Massey died in 1925, Liberal leader [[Thomas Wilford]] decided to approach Massey's successor with a merger-proposal, suggesting that the new party could use the name \"the National Party\". The Liberal Party chose Forbes to represent them at a joint conference. The new Reform Party leader, [[Gordon Coates]], rejected the proposal, although Wilford declared that Liberal would adopt the name \"National\" regardless.\n\n==Party leader==\n[[File:George Forbes, 1914.jpg|thumb|Forbes in 1914]]\nShortly after the merger proposal was rejected, Wilford resigned as leader, and Forbes unexpectedly became party leader. In the [[1925 New Zealand general election|election later that year]], however, the party did very badly, gaining only eleven seats compared with Reform's fifty-five. To compound the injury, Forbes no longer even held the post of [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] \u2013 the Labour Party had won twelve seats, enabling its leader [[Harry Holland]] to claim seniority in Opposition, although with two independents sitting in opposition as well the position of Leader of the Opposition remained vacant until Labour won the [[1926 Eden by-election]].\n\nThe party's poor fortune did not last long, however. In 1927, Liberal Party politician [[Bill Veitch]] secured an alliance with [[Albert Davy]], a former Reform Party [[Party organizer|organiser]] who had become dissatisfied with what he saw as Reform's [[paternalism]] and intrusive governance. The former Liberal Party (still known as National) absorbed Davy's new \"United New Zealand Political Organization\", and adopted the name \"[[United Party (New Zealand)|the United Party]]\". Forbes and Veitch both vied as candidates for the leadership of the United Party, but the position eventually went to a former Liberal Party Prime Minister, [[Joseph Ward]]. Forbes  became one of two deputy leaders, having particular responsibility for the [[South Island]].\n\nUnder the United banner, bolstered by Reform Party dissidents, the remnants of the old Liberal Party once again gained traction. In the [[1928 New Zealand general election|1928 election]], United formed a government with backing from the Labour Party. Forbes gained the portfolios of Lands and Agriculture. Gradually, however, Ward's health declined to the state where he was unable to carry out his duties, and Forbes became leader in all but name. In 1930, Ward finally gave his official resignation, and Forbes became Prime Minister. He also made himself [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].\n\n==Prime Minister==\nAs Prime Minister, Forbes, described as \"apathetic and fatalistic\", reacted to events but showed little vision or purpose. Opponents also criticised him for relying too much on the advice of his friends. However, the depression years proved a difficult time for many governments around the world, and his defenders claim that he did the best job possible in the circumstances of the economic crisis. During his premiership, Forbes also served as the [[Department of Island Territories (New Zealand)#Minister of Island Territories|Minister of External Affairs]] between 1930 and 1935.<ref>''New Zealand Parliamentary Debates'', vol. 226-243 (1930-1935).</ref>\n\nThe Forbes government began to show signs of instability when the Labour Party withdrew its support. Labour expressed dissatisfaction with a number of the government's economic measures \u2013 Forbes intended them to reduce the government deficit and to stimulate the economy, but Labour claimed that they unnecessarily harmed the interests of poorer citizens. Forbes had perforce to continue with reluctant support from the Reform Party, which now feared Labour's growing popularity.\n\nIn late 1931, Forbes called for a \"grand coalition\" of United, Reform, and Labour to resolve the country's economic problems. Forbes told a joint conference that he would not implement the measures he deemed necessary without broad backing. Labour refused to join this coalition, but ex-PM Coates (prompted by the Reform Party's finance spokesperson, [[William Downie Stewart Jr]]) eventually agreed.\n\nIn the [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931 election]], the [[United-Reform Coalition]] performed well, winning a combined total of fifty-one seats. Forbes remained Prime Minister, but surrendered the finance role to William Stewart. Slowly, however, many people came to believe that Coates held significantly too much power, and that Forbes showed himself overwilling to give in to Coates' demands. This view became reinforced when Coates and Stewart argued over financial policy \u2013 although Forbes was known to prefer Stewart's policy, he publicly sided with Coates, and Stewart resigned.\n\nCoates replaced Stewart as Minister of Finance, and became even more dominant in the coalition. Stewart, noting this, complained that \"the Prime Minister is too passive and the Minister of Finance is too active\". Both Forbes and Coates, however, increasingly took the blame for the country's ongoing economic problems, and could not avoid public dissatisfaction. In the [[1935 New Zealand general election|election of 1935]] the Labour Party defeated the coalition government, gaining fifty-five votes to the coalition's nineteen.\n\nIn 1935, Forbes was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]],<ref name=\"EP\">{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4 }}</ref> and in 1937, he was awarded the [[King George VI Coronation Medal]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Alister|last=Taylor| title=The New Zealand Roll of Honour| publisher=Alister Taylor| year=1998 | isbn=0-908578-58-X| pages=449}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nBy 1935 Forbes had become increasingly weary of politics, writing that he agreed with Stewart's description of the profession as \"slavery that is miscalled power\". Nevertheless, Forbes reluctantly allowed his colleagues to select him as Leader of the Opposition, and from May 1936 led the new [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] (created out of United and Reform) until October 1936 when [[Adam Hamilton]] became the party leader. Both party and leader agreed on Forbes's tenure as leader of the new National Party as a temporary measure, as Forbes had indicated his desire to withdraw from the limelight, and younger figures in the party saw his past tenure as a political liability.\n\nForbes retained his parliamentary seat until 1943, when he retired after 35 years as a Member of Parliament. He declined the offer of the customary knighthood, and four years after his retirement he died at Crystal Brook, his farm near [[Cheviot, New Zealand|Cheviot]].\n\nThe national memorial for Forbes, the George Forbes Memorial Library, forms part of [[Lincoln University, New Zealand|Lincoln University]] near Christchurch.<ref>See {{citation |title = Architectural competition |journal=Journal of the NZ Institute of Architects |volume = 23 |issue = 8 |page = 201 |year = 1956}}, and {{citation |first1 = M.

[[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|22nd Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 28 May 1930 to 6 December 1935.\n\nForbes was born in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] and later began farming near [[Christchurch]]. He became active in local politics. Forbes first entered the House of Representatives in 1908 as a member of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], and when that party declined he became the leader of the newly created [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] in 1928. His rise to power as Prime Minister was unexpected, and some believed him unsuited to the post; it was his misfortune to hold office during the very worst period of the [[Great Depression]]. He nevertheless remained in power for five years. Forbes headed the [[United\u2013Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|United\u2013Reform coalition Government]] that eventually became the modern [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\nOften referred to as \"Honest George\", Forbes had a reputation for probity, rare debating skill, and impressive memory. His courteous and friendly attitude earned him the liking and respect of parliamentarians from all sides of the House.  Throughout his time in national politics his [[Hurunui (New Zealand electorate)|Hurunui]] constituents held Forbes in high regard: even when Prime Minister he would roll up his sleeves and help load sheep from his farm on the railway wagons for market.\n\n==Early life==\nForbes was born in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], just outside the city of [[Christchurch]]. He gained his education at [[Christchurch Boys' High School]] in Christchurch, and did not attend university. He became known for his ability at sport, particularly in athletics, [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], and [[rugby football|rugby]] where he captained the Canterbury team. After finishing school he briefly worked in his father's ships' [[chandlery]] business in Lyttelton, but later established himself as a successful farmer near [[Cheviot, New Zealand|Cheviot]], to the north of Christchurch. He quickly became active in the local politics of the region, particularly with regard to the Cheviot County Council and the Cheviot Settlers' Association.<ref name=\"DNZB Forbes\">{{DNZB|last=Gardner|first=W.

Both party and leader agreed on Forbes's tenure as leader of the new National Party as a temporary measure, as Forbes had indicated his desire to withdraw from the limelight, and younger figures in the party saw his past tenure as a political liability.\n\nForbes retained his parliamentary seat until 1943, when he retired after 35 years as a Member of Parliament. He declined the offer of the customary knighthood, and four years after his retirement he died at Crystal Brook, his farm near [[Cheviot, New Zealand|Cheviot]].\n\nThe national memorial for Forbes, the George Forbes Memorial Library, forms part of [[Lincoln University, New Zealand|Lincoln University]] near Christchurch.<ref>See {{citation |title = Architectural competition |journal=Journal of the NZ Institute of Architects |volume = 23 |issue = 8 |page = 201 |year = 1956}}, and {{citation |first1 = M.

''Kurf\u00fcrsten'', {{lang-cz|Kurfi\u0159t}}, {{lang-la|Princeps Elector}}) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], or '''Electors''' for short, were the members of the [[electoral college]] that elected the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nFrom the 13th century onwards, the Prince-Electors had the privilege of [[Imperial election|electing the monarch]] who would receive the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronation]] at the hands of the [[Pope]]. After 1508, the election was sufficient to acquire the Imperial title without Papal coronation. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last person to be a crowned Emperor (elected 1519, crowned 1530); his successors were only elected Emperors by the electoral college, each being titled \"Elected Emperor of the Romans\" ({{lang-de|erw\u00e4hlter R\u00f6mischer Kaiser}}; {{lang-la|electus Romanorum imperator}}). \n\nIn practice, election by the princely electoral college was merely a [[de jure]] requirement. [[De facto]] the Imperial throne followed the [[order of succession]] of the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]]: every emperor from 1440 onwards came from the [[House of Austria]] except for [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]] (r. 1742\u20131745) and [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] (r. 1745\u20131765), both of whom were related to the Habsburgs by blood or marriage. In the end, the Electors merely ratified such inheritance.\n\nThe dignity of Elector carried great prestige and was considered to be second only to that of King or Emperor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/nations.htm|title=Precedence among Nations|website=www.heraldica.org|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> The Electors held exclusive privileges that were not shared with other princes of the Empire, and they continued to hold their original titles alongside that of Elector. \n\nThe [[heir apparent]] to a secular prince-elector was known  as an '''electoral prince''' ({{lang-de|Kurprinz}}).\n\n== Etymology of ''Kurf\u00fcrst'' ==\n\nThe German element ''Kur-'' is based on the [[Middle High German]] irregular verb ''kiesen''<ref>[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]: [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kurfuerst Kurf\u00fcrst], [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kuer K\u00fcr] and [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kiesen kiesen]</ref> and is related etymologically to the English word ''choose'' (cf. [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceosan'' {{IPA-ang|t\u0283eo\u032fzan|}}, participle ''coren'' 'having been chosen' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''kiusan''). In English, the \"s\"/\"r\" mix in the Germanic verb conjugation has been regularized to \"s\" throughout, while German retains the ''r'' in ''Kur-''. There is also a modern German verb ''k\u00fcren'' which means 'to choose' in a ceremonial sense. \n\n''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' is German for 'prince', but while the German language distinguishes between the head of a principality (''der F\u00fcrst'') and the son of a monarch (''der Prinz''), English uses ''prince'' for both concepts. ''F\u00fcrst'' itself is related to English ''first'' and is thus the 'foremost' person in his realm. Note that 'prince' derives from Latin ''princeps'', which carried the same meaning.\n\n== Rights and privileges ==\nElectors were ''reichsst\u00e4nde'' ([[Imperial State|Imperial Estates]]), enjoying precedence over the other princes. They were, until the 18th century, exclusively entitled to be addressed with the title ''Durchlaucht'' (Serene Highness). In 1742, the electors became entitled to the superlative ''Durchl\u00e4uchtigste'' (Most Serene Highness), while other princes were promoted to ''Durchlaucht''.\n\nAs Imperial Estates, the electors enjoyed all the privileges of the other princes enjoying that status, including the right to enter into alliances, to autonomy in relation to dynastic affairs and to precedence over other subjects. The Golden Bull had granted them the [[Privilegium de non appellando]], which prevented their subjects from lodging an appeal to a higher Imperial court. However, while this privilege, and some others, were automatically granted to Electors, they were not exclusive to them and many of the larger Imperial Estates were also to be individually granted some or all those rights and privileges.<ref>Even a small [[Free Imperial City]] such as [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] had been granted the ''Privilegium de non appellando'' in 1475. Cf. [[:s:de:Kaiser Friedrich III.: Privilegium de non appellando f\u00fcr Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 1475|Kaiser Friedrich III.: Privilegium de non appellando f\u00fcr Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 1475]]</ref>\n\n== Imperial Diet ==\nThe electors, like the other princes ruling States of the Empire, were members of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], which was divided into three ''collegia'': the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities. In addition to being members of the Council of Electors, several lay electors were therefore members of the Council of Princes as well by virtue of other territories they possessed. In many cases, the lay electors ruled numerous States of the Empire, and therefore held several votes in the Council of Princes. In 1792, the King of Bohemia held three votes, the Elector of Bavaria six votes, the Elector of Brandenburg eight votes, and the Elector of Hanover six votes. \n\nThus, of the hundred votes in the [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)|Council of Princes in 1792]], twenty-three belonged to electors. The lay electors therefore exercised considerable influence, being members of the small Council of Electors and holding a significant number of votes in the Council of Princes. The assent of both bodies was required for important decisions affecting the structure of the Empire, such as the creation of new electorates or States of the Empire.\n\nIn addition to voting by colleges or councils, the Imperial Diet also voted in religious coalitions, as provided for in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The Archbishop of Mainz presided over the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] body, or ''corpus catholicorum'', while the Elector of Saxony presided over the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] body, or ''[[corpus evangelicorum]]''. The division into religious bodies was on the basis of the official religion of the state, and not of its rulers. Thus, even when the Electors of Saxony were Catholics during the eighteenth century, they continued to preside over the ''corpus evangelicorum'', since the state of Saxony was officially Protestant.\n\n== Elections ==\n{{Main|Imperial election}}\n\nThe electors were originally summoned by the Archbishop of Mainz within one month of an Emperor's death, and met within three months of being summoned. During the ''interregnum'', imperial power was exercised by two [[imperial vicar]]s. Each vicar, in the words of the Golden Bull, was \"the administrator of the empire itself, with the power of passing judgments, of presenting to ecclesiastical benefices, of collecting returns and revenues and investing with fiefs, of receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the holy empire\". The Elector of Saxony was vicar in areas operating under Saxon law ([[Saxony]], [[Westphalia]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], and northern Germany), while the Elector Palatine was vicar in the remainder of the Empire ([[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], the [[Rhine]], and southern Germany). The Elector of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, but when the latter was granted a new electorate in 1648, there was a dispute between the two as to which was vicar. In 1659, both purported to act as vicar, but the other vicar recognised the Elector of Bavaria. Later, the two electors made a pact to act as joint vicars, but the Imperial Diet rejected the agreement. In 1711, while the Elector of Bavaria was under the [[ban of the Empire]], the Elector Palatine again acted as vicar, but his cousin was restored to his position upon his restoration three years later.  \n\nFinally, in 1745, the two agreed to alternate as vicars, with Bavaria starting first. This arrangement was upheld by the Imperial Diet in 1752. In 1777 the question was settled when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.  On many occasions, however, there was no interregnum, as a new king had been elected during the lifetime of the previous Emperor.\n\n[[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] regularly served as the site of the election from the fifteenth century on, but elections were also held at [[Cologne]] (1531), [[Regensburg]] (1575 and 1636), and [[Augsburg]] (1653 and 1690). An elector could appear in person or could appoint another elector as his proxy. More often, an electoral suite or embassy was sent to cast the vote; the credentials of such representatives were verified by the Archbishop of Mainz, who presided over the ceremony. The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or ''Wahlkapelle'', was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased (including themselves), but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice. \n\nElectors drafted a ''[[Wahlkapitulation]]'', or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries, princes often acted merely to confirm hereditary succession in the Saxon [[Ottonian dynasty]] and Franconian [[Salian dynasty]]. But with the actual formation of the prince-elector class, elections became more open, starting with the election of [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]] in 1125. The [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty managed to get its sons formally elected in their fathers' lifetimes almost as a formality. After these lines ended in extinction, the electors began to elect kings from different families so that the throne would not once again settle within a single dynasty. \n\nFor some two centuries, the monarchy was elective both in theory and in practice; the arrangement, however, did not last, since the powerful [[House of Habsburg]] managed to secure succession within their dynasty during the fifteenth century. All kings elected from 1438 onwards were from among the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria (and later Kings of Hungary and Bohemia) until 1740, when the archduchy was inherited by a woman, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], sparking the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. \n\nA representative of the House of Wittelsbach was elected for a short period of time, but in 1745 Maria Theresa's husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, became King. All of his successors were also from the same family. Hence, for the greater part of the Empire's history, the role of the electors was largely ceremonial.\n\n=== High offices ===\n<!--This section linked from [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]-->\nAlthough highly ceremonial, the High Offices were comparable in status to modern Cabinet positions, as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Augmentation !!Imperial office !!

The three spiritual electors were all Arch-Chancellors ({{lang-de|Erzkanzler}}, {{lang-la|Archicancellarius}}): the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] was Arch-Chancellor of Germany, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] was Arch-Chancellor of Italy, and the [[Archbishop of Trier]] was Arch-Chancellor of Burgundy. That left between four and six secular electors.\n\nWhen the [[Duke of Bavaria]] replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, he assumed the latter's office of Arch-Steward. When the Count Palatine was granted a new electorate, he assumed the position of Arch-Treasurer of the Empire. When the Duke of Bavaria was banned in 1706, the Elector Palatine returned to the office of Arch-Steward, and in 1710 the Elector of Hanover was promoted to the post of Arch-Treasurer. Matters were complicated by the Duke of Bavaria's restoration in 1714; the Elector of Bavaria resumed the office of Arch-Steward, while the Elector Palatine returned to the post of Arch-Treasurer, and the Elector of Hanover was given the new office of Archbannerbearer. The Electors of Hanover, however, continued to be styled Arch-Treasurers, though the Elector Palatine was the one who actually exercised the office until 1777, when he inherited Bavaria and the Arch-Stewardship. After 1777, no further changes were made to the Imperial Household; new offices were planned for the Electors admitted in 1803, but the Empire was abolished before they could be created. The Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, however, started to adopt the trappings of the Arch-Bannerbearer.\n\nMany High Officers were entitled to use [[Augmentation of Honour|augmentations]] on their [[heraldry|coats of arms]]; these augmentations, which were special marks of honour, appeared in the centre of the electors' shields (as shown in the image above) atop the other charges (in [[Heraldry|heraldic]] terms, the augmentations appeared in the form of [[inescutcheon]]s). The Arch-Steward used ''[[gules]] an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'' (a gold orb on a red field). The Arch-Marshal utilised the more complicated ''[[Fess|per fess]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and [[argent]], two swords in [[saltire]] gules'' (two red swords arranged in the form of a [[saltire]], on a black and white field). The Arch-Chamberlain's augmentation was ''[[azure (heraldry)|azure]] a sceptre [[Pale (heraldry)|palewise]] Or'' (a gold sceptre on a blue field), while the Arch-Treasurer's was ''gules the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of Charlemagne]] Or'' (a gold crown on a red field). As noted above, the Elector Palatine and the Elector of Hanover styled themselves Arch-Treasurer from 1714 until 1777; during this time, both electors used the corresponding augmentations. The three Arch-Chancellors and the Arch-Cupbearer did not use any augmentations.\n\nThe electors discharged the ceremonial duties associated with their offices only during coronations, where they bore the crown and regalia of the Empire. Otherwise, they were represented by holders of corresponding \"[[Hereditary Offices of the Household]]\". The Arch-Butler was represented by the Butler ([[Cupbearer]]) (the [[Count of Althann]]), the Arch-Seneschal by the [[Steward (office)|Steward]] (the [[House of Waldburg|Count of Waldburg]]), the Arch-Chamberlain by the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] (the [[Count of Hohenzollern]]), the Arch-Marshal by the [[Marshal]] (the [[Count of Pappenheim]]), and the Arch-Treasurer by the [[Treasurer]] (the [[Count of Sinzendorf]]). The Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg assigned the count of Zeppelin-[[Aschhausen]] as hereditary Bannerbearer.\n\n===Electoral Arms===\n[[File:Wapen 1545 Kaiserwappen des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reichs Polychromie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Coats of arms of prince electors surround the Holy Roman Emperor's; from flags book of [[Jacob K\u00f6bel]] (1545).

Elections were irregularly held by the [[Franks]], whose [[successor state]]s include [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]] eventually became [[Heredity|hereditary]], but the Holy Roman Emperors remained elective, at least in theory, although the Habsburgs provided most of the later monarchs. While all free men originally exercised the right to vote in such elections, suffrage eventually came to be limited to the leading men of the realm. In the election of [[Lothar II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar II]] in 1125, a small number of eminent [[nobility|noble]]s chose the monarch and then submitted him to the remaining magnates for their approbation.\n\nSoon, the right to choose the monarch was settled on an exclusive group of princes, and the procedure of seeking the approval of the remaining nobles was abandoned. The college of electors was mentioned in 1152 and again in 1198. The composition of electors at that time is unclear, but appears to have included representatives of the church and the [[duke]]s of the [[Stem duchy|four nations of Germany]]: the [[Franks]] ([[Duchy of Franconia]]), [[Swabians]] ([[Duchy of Swabia]]), [[Saxons]] ([[Duchy of Saxony]]) and [[Bavarians]] ([[Duchy of Bavaria]]).\n\n=== 1257 to Thirty Years' War ===\n\nThe electoral college is known to have existed by 1152, but its composition is unknown. A letter written by [[Pope Urban IV]] in 1265 suggests that by \"[[time immemorial|immemorial custom]]\", seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor. The pope wrote that the seven electors were those who had just voted in the election of 1257, which resulted in the election of two kings.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryce |first1=James |title=The Holy Roman Empire |date=1866 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=252 |edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n* Three ecclesiastical Electors:\n** The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]]\n** The [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]]\n** The [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]\n* Four secular Electors:\n** The [[King of Bohemia]]\n** The [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]]\n** The [[Electorate of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]\n** The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]]\n\nThe three Archbishops oversaw the most venerable and powerful [[Episcopal see|see]]s in Germany, while the other four were supposed to represent the dukes of the four nations. The Count Palatine of the Rhine held most of the former Duchy of Franconia after the last Duke died in 1039. The Margrave of Brandenburg became an Elector when the Duchy of Swabia was dissolved after the last Duke of Swabia was beheaded in 1268. Saxony, even with diminished territory, retained its eminent position.\n\nThe Palatinate and Bavaria were originally (since 1214) held by the same individual, but in 1253 they were divided between two members of the [[House of Wittelsbach]]. The other electors refused to allow two princes from the same dynasty to have electoral rights, so a heated rivalry arose between the Count Palatine and the Duke of Bavaria over who should hold the Wittelsbach seat.\n\nMeanwhile, the King of Bohemia, who held the ancient imperial office of Arch-Cupbearer, asserted his right to participate in elections. Sometimes he was challenged on the grounds that his kingdom was not German, though usually he was recognized, instead of Bavaria which after all was just a younger line of Wittelsbachs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[Declaration of Rhense]] issued in 1338 had the effect that election by the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] finally resolved the disputes among the electors. Under it, the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Archbishop of Trier|Trier]], and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], as well as the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], and the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] held the right to elect the King.\n\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The Ratification of the Treaty of M\u00fcnster'' by Gerard Terborch, 1648.]]\n\nThe college's composition remained unchanged until the 17th century, although the Electorate of Saxony was transferred from the senior to the junior branch of the Wettin family in 1547, in the aftermath of the [[Schmalkaldic War]].\n\n=== Thirty Years' War to Napoleon ===\n\nIn 1621, the Elector Palatine, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]], came under the [[imperial ban]] after participating in the [[Thirty Years' War#The Bohemian Revolt|Bohemian Revolt]] (a part of the [[Thirty Years' War]]). The Elector Palatine's seat was conferred on the Duke of Bavaria, the head of a junior branch of his family. Originally, the Duke held the electorate personally, but it was later made hereditary along with the duchy. When the Thirty Years' War concluded with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, a new electorate was created for the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Since the Elector of Bavaria retained his seat, the number of electors increased to eight; the two Wittelsbach lines were now sufficiently estranged so as not to pose a combined potential threat.\n\nIn 1685, the religious composition of the College of Electors was disrupted when a Catholic branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the Palatinate. A new Protestant electorate was created in 1692 for the Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, who became known as the Elector of Hanover (the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] officially confirmed the creation in 1708). The Elector of Saxony converted to Catholicism in 1697 so that he could become King of Poland, but no additional Protestant electors were created. Although the Elector of Saxony was personally Catholic, the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant, and the Elector even remained the leader of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)#Religious bodies|Protestant body in the Reichstag]].\n\nIn 1706, the Elector of Bavaria and Archbishop of Cologne were [[Imperial ban|banned]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], but both were restored in 1714 after the [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Peace of Baden]]. In 1777, the number of electors was reduced to eight when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.\n\nMany changes to the composition of the college were necessitated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s aggression during the early 19th century. The [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), which ceded territory on the [[Rhine]]'s left bank to [[France]], led to the abolition of the archbishoprics of Trier and Cologne, and the transfer of the remaining spiritual Elector from Mainz to [[Regensburg]]. In 1803, electorates were created for the [[Rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], the [[Margrave of Baden]], the [[Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]], and the [[Duchy of Salzburg|Duke of Salzburg]], bringing the total number of electors to ten. When [[Austria]] annexed Salzburg under the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)]], the Duke of Salzburg moved to the [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] and retained his electorate. None of the new electors, however, had an opportunity to cast votes, as the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806, and the new electorates were never confirmed by the Emperor.\n\n=== After the Empire ===\n\nAfter the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in August 1806, the Electors continued to reign over their territories, many of them taking higher titles. The Electors of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Saxony styled themselves Kings, while the Electors of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Regensburg]], and [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|W\u00fcrzburg]] became Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hesse-Kassel, however, retained the meaningless title \"Elector of Hesse\", thus distinguishing himself from other Hessian princes (the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt and the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg). Napoleon soon exiled him and Kassel was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], a new creation. The King of Great Britain remained at war with Napoleon and continued to style himself Elector of Hanover, while the Hanoverian government continued to operate in London.\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] accepted the Electors of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Saxony as Kings, along with the newly created Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hanover finally joined his fellow Electors by declaring himself the King of Hanover. The restored Elector of Hesse, a Napoleonic creation, tried to be recognized as the King of the [[Chatti]]. However, the European powers refused to acknowledge this title at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]] and instead listed him with the [[grand duchy|grand dukes]] as a \"Royal Highness\".<ref name=\"satow1932\">{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetodiplomati00satouoft|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London}}</ref> Believing the title of Prince-Elector to be superior in dignity to that of Grand Duke, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel chose to remain an Elector, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor to elect. Hesse-Kassel remained the only Electorate in Germany until 1866, when the country backed the losing side in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was absorbed into Prussia.\n\n==Confessional balance==\n\nReligion was a factor in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor, as some [[Protestant]] electors would refuse to vote for a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[vice versa]]. Most of the time, religion played a minor role and was overshadowed by other factors, including dynastic, territorial and other political interests. For example, the Protestant [[Elector of Saxony]] voted for [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]], putting his political interests first even though Ferdinand was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] who would eventually lead the Empire into the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt the height of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there were times when the electoral college had a Protestant majority. However, all of the Holy Roman Emperors were Catholic. Some historians maintain that [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] had been touched by the Reformed theology and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained nominally Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed.<ref>See Parker, pp. 20\u201350.</ref> Other historians maintain he was as Catholic as his brother, but tended to see religion as outside the political sphere.<ref>Holborn, pp. 250\u2013251.</ref>\n\n===Spiritual===\n\n*The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Elector of Mainz]] was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Trier|Elector of Trier]]  was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]] was usually a [[Roman Catholic]], with the exception of [[Hermann V von Wied]] ([[Lutheran]], 1542\u20131546) and [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg]] ([[Calvinist|Reformed]] 1582\u20131588).\n\n===Secular===\n*The [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Elector of Bohemia]] was usually a [[Roman Catholic]], with the exception of [[George of Podebrady]] ([[Hussite]], 1457\u20131471) and [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick I]] ([[Calvinist|Reformed]], 1619\u20131620).\n*The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]], who was also [[List of monarchs of Prussia|Duke of Prussia]] from 1618 (King in Prussia from 1701, King of Prussia from 1772), was [[Roman Catholic]] until 1539, then [[Lutheran]] until 1613, then [[Calvinist|Reformed]] until the end of the Empire.\n*The [[Electoral Palatinate|Elector Palatine]] was [[Roman Catholic]] until the 1530s, then a [[Lutheran]] until 1559, then a [[Calvinist|Reformed]] until 1575, then again [[Lutheran]] until 1583, then again [[Calvinist|Refomed]] until 1623, when the electoral dignity was lost to [[Electoral Bavaria|Bavaria]].\n*The [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] was [[Roman Catholic]] until 1525, then [[Lutheran]] until 1697, and then again [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n===Added in the 17th century===\n*The [[Electorate of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] was always [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Elector of Hanover]], was [[Lutheran]] until 1714, when he became [[List of British monarchs|King of Great Britain]] and also the head of the [[Anglican]] [[Church of England]].\n\n===Added in the 19th century===\n*The [[Principality of Regensburg|Elector of Regensburg]] [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]] was [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Salzburg|Elector of Salzburg]] (1803\u20131805) and [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] (1805\u20131806) [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III and I]] was [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Elector of W\u00fcrttemberg]] [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]] was [[Lutheran]].\n*The [[Electorate of Baden|Elector of Baden]] [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick]] was [[Lutheran]].\n*The [[Electorate of Hesse|Elector of Hesse]] [[William I, Elector of Hesse|William I]] was [[Calvinist|Reformed]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[Elective monarchy]]\n* [[Electoral Palace (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Electress]]\n* [[Imperial election]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Bryce, J.

''Kurf\u00fcrsten'', {{lang-cz|Kurfi\u0159t}}, {{lang-la|Princeps Elector}}) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], or '''Electors''' for short, were the members of the [[electoral college]] that elected the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nFrom the 13th century onwards, the Prince-Electors had the privilege of [[Imperial election|electing the monarch]] who would receive the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronation]] at the hands of the [[Pope]]. After 1508, the election was sufficient to acquire the Imperial title without Papal coronation. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last person to be a crowned Emperor (elected 1519, crowned 1530); his successors were only elected Emperors by the electoral college, each being titled \"Elected Emperor of the Romans\" ({{lang-de|erw\u00e4hlter R\u00f6mischer Kaiser}}; {{lang-la|electus Romanorum imperator}}). \n\nIn practice, election by the princely electoral college was merely a [[de jure]] requirement. [[De facto]] the Imperial throne followed the [[order of succession]] of the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]]: every emperor from 1440 onwards came from the [[House of Austria]] except for [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]] (r. 1742\u20131745) and [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] (r. 1745\u20131765), both of whom were related to the Habsburgs by blood or marriage. In the end, the Electors merely ratified such inheritance.\n\nThe dignity of Elector carried great prestige and was considered to be second only to that of King or Emperor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/nations.htm|title=Precedence among Nations|website=www.heraldica.org|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> The Electors held exclusive privileges that were not shared with other princes of the Empire, and they continued to hold their original titles alongside that of Elector. \n\nThe [[heir apparent]] to a secular prince-elector was known  as an '''electoral prince''' ({{lang-de|Kurprinz}}).\n\n== Etymology of ''Kurf\u00fcrst'' ==\n\nThe German element ''Kur-'' is based on the [[Middle High German]] irregular verb ''kiesen''<ref>[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]: [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kurfuerst Kurf\u00fcrst], [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kuer K\u00fcr] and [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kiesen kiesen]</ref> and is related etymologically to the English word ''choose'' (cf. [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceosan'' {{IPA-ang|t\u0283eo\u032fzan|}}, participle ''coren'' 'having been chosen' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''kiusan''). In English, the \"s\"/\"r\" mix in the Germanic verb conjugation has been regularized to \"s\" throughout, while German retains the ''r'' in ''Kur-''. There is also a modern German verb ''k\u00fcren'' which means 'to choose' in a ceremonial sense. \n\n''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' is German for 'prince', but while the German language distinguishes between the head of a principality (''der F\u00fcrst'') and the son of a monarch (''der Prinz''), English uses ''prince'' for both concepts. ''F\u00fcrst'' itself is related to English ''first'' and is thus the 'foremost' person in his realm. Note that 'prince' derives from Latin ''princeps'', which carried the same meaning.\n\n== Rights and privileges ==\nElectors were ''reichsst\u00e4nde'' ([[Imperial State|Imperial Estates]]), enjoying precedence over the other princes. They were, until the 18th century, exclusively entitled to be addressed with the title ''Durchlaucht'' (Serene Highness). In 1742, the electors became entitled to the superlative ''Durchl\u00e4uchtigste'' (Most Serene Highness), while other princes were promoted to ''Durchlaucht''.\n\nAs Imperial Estates, the electors enjoyed all the privileges of the other princes enjoying that status, including the right to enter into alliances, to autonomy in relation to dynastic affairs and to precedence over other subjects. The Golden Bull had granted them the [[Privilegium de non appellando]], which prevented their subjects from lodging an appeal to a higher Imperial court. However, while this privilege, and some others, were automatically granted to Electors, they were not exclusive to them and many of the larger Imperial Estates were also to be individually granted some or all those rights and privileges.<ref>Even a small [[Free Imperial City]] such as [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] had been granted the ''Privilegium de non appellando'' in 1475. Cf. [[:s:de:Kaiser Friedrich III.: Privilegium de non appellando f\u00fcr Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 1475|Kaiser Friedrich III.: Privilegium de non appellando f\u00fcr Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 1475]]</ref>\n\n== Imperial Diet ==\nThe electors, like the other princes ruling States of the Empire, were members of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], which was divided into three ''collegia'': the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities. In addition to being members of the Council of Electors, several lay electors were therefore members of the Council of Princes as well by virtue of other territories they possessed. In many cases, the lay electors ruled numerous States of the Empire, and therefore held several votes in the Council of Princes. In 1792, the King of Bohemia held three votes, the Elector of Bavaria six votes, the Elector of Brandenburg eight votes, and the Elector of Hanover six votes. \n\nThus, of the hundred votes in the [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)|Council of Princes in 1792]], twenty-three belonged to electors. The lay electors therefore exercised considerable influence, being members of the small Council of Electors and holding a significant number of votes in the Council of Princes. The assent of both bodies was required for important decisions affecting the structure of the Empire, such as the creation of new electorates or States of the Empire.\n\nIn addition to voting by colleges or councils, the Imperial Diet also voted in religious coalitions, as provided for in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The Archbishop of Mainz presided over the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] body, or ''corpus catholicorum'', while the Elector of Saxony presided over the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] body, or ''[[corpus evangelicorum]]''. The division into religious bodies was on the basis of the official religion of the state, and not of its rulers. Thus, even when the Electors of Saxony were Catholics during the eighteenth century, they continued to preside over the ''corpus evangelicorum'', since the state of Saxony was officially Protestant.\n\n== Elections ==\n{{Main|Imperial election}}\n\nThe electors were originally summoned by the Archbishop of Mainz within one month of an Emperor's death, and met within three months of being summoned. During the ''interregnum'', imperial power was exercised by two [[imperial vicar]]s. Each vicar, in the words of the Golden Bull, was \"the administrator of the empire itself, with the power of passing judgments, of presenting to ecclesiastical benefices, of collecting returns and revenues and investing with fiefs, of receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the holy empire\". The Elector of Saxony was vicar in areas operating under Saxon law ([[Saxony]], [[Westphalia]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], and northern Germany), while the Elector Palatine was vicar in the remainder of the Empire ([[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], the [[Rhine]], and southern Germany). The Elector of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, but when the latter was granted a new electorate in 1648, there was a dispute between the two as to which was vicar. In 1659, both purported to act as vicar, but the other vicar recognised the Elector of Bavaria. Later, the two electors made a pact to act as joint vicars, but the Imperial Diet rejected the agreement. In 1711, while the Elector of Bavaria was under the [[ban of the Empire]], the Elector Palatine again acted as vicar, but his cousin was restored to his position upon his restoration three years later.  \n\nFinally, in 1745, the two agreed to alternate as vicars, with Bavaria starting first. This arrangement was upheld by the Imperial Diet in 1752. In 1777 the question was settled when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.  On many occasions, however, there was no interregnum, as a new king had been elected during the lifetime of the previous Emperor.\n\n[[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] regularly served as the site of the election from the fifteenth century on, but elections were also held at [[Cologne]] (1531), [[Regensburg]] (1575 and 1636), and [[Augsburg]] (1653 and 1690). An elector could appear in person or could appoint another elector as his proxy. More often, an electoral suite or embassy was sent to cast the vote; the credentials of such representatives were verified by the Archbishop of Mainz, who presided over the ceremony. The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or ''Wahlkapelle'', was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased (including themselves), but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice. \n\nElectors drafted a ''[[Wahlkapitulation]]'', or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries, princes often acted merely to confirm hereditary succession in the Saxon [[Ottonian dynasty]] and Franconian [[Salian dynasty]]. But with the actual formation of the prince-elector class, elections became more open, starting with the election of [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]] in 1125. The [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty managed to get its sons formally elected in their fathers' lifetimes almost as a formality. After these lines ended in extinction, the electors began to elect kings from different families so that the throne would not once again settle within a single dynasty. \n\nFor some two centuries, the monarchy was elective both in theory and in practice; the arrangement, however, did not last, since the powerful [[House of Habsburg]] managed to secure succession within their dynasty during the fifteenth century. All kings elected from 1438 onwards were from among the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria (and later Kings of Hungary and Bohemia) until 1740, when the archduchy was inherited by a woman, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], sparking the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. \n\nA representative of the House of Wittelsbach was elected for a short period of time, but in 1745 Maria Theresa's husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, became King. All of his successors were also from the same family. Hence, for the greater part of the Empire's history, the role of the electors was largely ceremonial.\n\n=== High offices ===\n<!--This section linked from [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]-->\nAlthough highly ceremonial, the High Offices were comparable in status to modern Cabinet positions, as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Augmentation !!Imperial office !!

The three spiritual electors were all Arch-Chancellors ({{lang-de|Erzkanzler}}, {{lang-la|Archicancellarius}}): the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] was Arch-Chancellor of Germany, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] was Arch-Chancellor of Italy, and the [[Archbishop of Trier]] was Arch-Chancellor of Burgundy. That left between four and six secular electors.\n\nWhen the [[Duke of Bavaria]] replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, he assumed the latter's office of Arch-Steward. When the Count Palatine was granted a new electorate, he assumed the position of Arch-Treasurer of the Empire. When the Duke of Bavaria was banned in 1706, the Elector Palatine returned to the office of Arch-Steward, and in 1710 the Elector of Hanover was promoted to the post of Arch-Treasurer. Matters were complicated by the Duke of Bavaria's restoration in 1714; the Elector of Bavaria resumed the office of Arch-Steward, while the Elector Palatine returned to the post of Arch-Treasurer, and the Elector of Hanover was given the new office of Archbannerbearer. The Electors of Hanover, however, continued to be styled Arch-Treasurers, though the Elector Palatine was the one who actually exercised the office until 1777, when he inherited Bavaria and the Arch-Stewardship. After 1777, no further changes were made to the Imperial Household; new offices were planned for the Electors admitted in 1803, but the Empire was abolished before they could be created. The Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, however, started to adopt the trappings of the Arch-Bannerbearer.\n\nMany High Officers were entitled to use [[Augmentation of Honour|augmentations]] on their [[heraldry|coats of arms]]; these augmentations, which were special marks of honour, appeared in the centre of the electors' shields (as shown in the image above) atop the other charges (in [[Heraldry|heraldic]] terms, the augmentations appeared in the form of [[inescutcheon]]s). The Arch-Steward used ''[[gules]] an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'' (a gold orb on a red field). The Arch-Marshal utilised the more complicated ''[[Fess|per fess]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and [[argent]], two swords in [[saltire]] gules'' (two red swords arranged in the form of a [[saltire]], on a black and white field). The Arch-Chamberlain's augmentation was ''[[azure (heraldry)|azure]] a sceptre [[Pale (heraldry)|palewise]] Or'' (a gold sceptre on a blue field), while the Arch-Treasurer's was ''gules the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of Charlemagne]] Or'' (a gold crown on a red field). As noted above, the Elector Palatine and the Elector of Hanover styled themselves Arch-Treasurer from 1714 until 1777; during this time, both electors used the corresponding augmentations. The three Arch-Chancellors and the Arch-Cupbearer did not use any augmentations.\n\nThe electors discharged the ceremonial duties associated with their offices only during coronations, where they bore the crown and regalia of the Empire. Otherwise, they were represented by holders of corresponding \"[[Hereditary Offices of the Household]]\". The Arch-Butler was represented by the Butler ([[Cupbearer]]) (the [[Count of Althann]]), the Arch-Seneschal by the [[Steward (office)|Steward]] (the [[House of Waldburg|Count of Waldburg]]), the Arch-Chamberlain by the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] (the [[Count of Hohenzollern]]), the Arch-Marshal by the [[Marshal]] (the [[Count of Pappenheim]]), and the Arch-Treasurer by the [[Treasurer]] (the [[Count of Sinzendorf]]). The Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg assigned the count of Zeppelin-[[Aschhausen]] as hereditary Bannerbearer.\n\n===Electoral Arms===\n[[File:Wapen 1545 Kaiserwappen des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reichs Polychromie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Coats of arms of prince electors surround the Holy Roman Emperor's; from flags book of [[Jacob K\u00f6bel]] (1545).

Elections were irregularly held by the [[Franks]], whose [[successor state]]s include [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]] eventually became [[Heredity|hereditary]], but the Holy Roman Emperors remained elective, at least in theory, although the Habsburgs provided most of the later monarchs. While all free men originally exercised the right to vote in such elections, suffrage eventually came to be limited to the leading men of the realm. In the election of [[Lothar II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar II]] in 1125, a small number of eminent [[nobility|noble]]s chose the monarch and then submitted him to the remaining magnates for their approbation.\n\nSoon, the right to choose the monarch was settled on an exclusive group of princes, and the procedure of seeking the approval of the remaining nobles was abandoned. The college of electors was mentioned in 1152 and again in 1198. The composition of electors at that time is unclear, but appears to have included representatives of the church and the [[duke]]s of the [[Stem duchy|four nations of Germany]]: the [[Franks]] ([[Duchy of Franconia]]), [[Swabians]] ([[Duchy of Swabia]]), [[Saxons]] ([[Duchy of Saxony]]) and [[Bavarians]] ([[Duchy of Bavaria]]).\n\n=== 1257 to Thirty Years' War ===\n\nThe electoral college is known to have existed by 1152, but its composition is unknown. A letter written by [[Pope Urban IV]] in 1265 suggests that by \"[[time immemorial|immemorial custom]]\", seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor. The pope wrote that the seven electors were those who had just voted in the election of 1257, which resulted in the election of two kings.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryce |first1=James |title=The Holy Roman Empire |date=1866 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=252 |edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n* Three ecclesiastical Electors:\n** The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]]\n** The [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]]\n** The [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]\n* Four secular Electors:\n** The [[King of Bohemia]]\n** The [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]]\n** The [[Electorate of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]\n** The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]]\n\nThe three Archbishops oversaw the most venerable and powerful [[Episcopal see|see]]s in Germany, while the other four were supposed to represent the dukes of the four nations. The Count Palatine of the Rhine held most of the former Duchy of Franconia after the last Duke died in 1039. The Margrave of Brandenburg became an Elector when the Duchy of Swabia was dissolved after the last Duke of Swabia was beheaded in 1268. Saxony, even with diminished territory, retained its eminent position.\n\nThe Palatinate and Bavaria were originally (since 1214) held by the same individual, but in 1253 they were divided between two members of the [[House of Wittelsbach]]. The other electors refused to allow two princes from the same dynasty to have electoral rights, so a heated rivalry arose between the Count Palatine and the Duke of Bavaria over who should hold the Wittelsbach seat.\n\nMeanwhile, the King of Bohemia, who held the ancient imperial office of Arch-Cupbearer, asserted his right to participate in elections. Sometimes he was challenged on the grounds that his kingdom was not German, though usually he was recognized, instead of Bavaria which after all was just a younger line of Wittelsbachs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[Declaration of Rhense]] issued in 1338 had the effect that election by the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] finally resolved the disputes among the electors. Under it, the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Archbishop of Trier|Trier]], and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], as well as the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], and the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] held the right to elect the King.\n\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The Ratification of the Treaty of M\u00fcnster'' by Gerard Terborch, 1648.]]\n\nThe college's composition remained unchanged until the 17th century, although the Electorate of Saxony was transferred from the senior to the junior branch of the Wettin family in 1547, in the aftermath of the [[Schmalkaldic War]].\n\n=== Thirty Years' War to Napoleon ===\n\nIn 1621, the Elector Palatine, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]], came under the [[imperial ban]] after participating in the [[Thirty Years' War#The Bohemian Revolt|Bohemian Revolt]] (a part of the [[Thirty Years' War]]). The Elector Palatine's seat was conferred on the Duke of Bavaria, the head of a junior branch of his family. Originally, the Duke held the electorate personally, but it was later made hereditary along with the duchy. When the Thirty Years' War concluded with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, a new electorate was created for the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Since the Elector of Bavaria retained his seat, the number of electors increased to eight; the two Wittelsbach lines were now sufficiently estranged so as not to pose a combined potential threat.\n\nIn 1685, the religious composition of the College of Electors was disrupted when a Catholic branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the Palatinate. A new Protestant electorate was created in 1692 for the Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, who became known as the Elector of Hanover (the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] officially confirmed the creation in 1708). The Elector of Saxony converted to Catholicism in 1697 so that he could become King of Poland, but no additional Protestant electors were created. Although the Elector of Saxony was personally Catholic, the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant, and the Elector even remained the leader of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)#Religious bodies|Protestant body in the Reichstag]].\n\nIn 1706, the Elector of Bavaria and Archbishop of Cologne were [[Imperial ban|banned]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], but both were restored in 1714 after the [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Peace of Baden]]. In 1777, the number of electors was reduced to eight when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.\n\nMany changes to the composition of the college were necessitated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s aggression during the early 19th century. The [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), which ceded territory on the [[Rhine]]'s left bank to [[France]], led to the abolition of the archbishoprics of Trier and Cologne, and the transfer of the remaining spiritual Elector from Mainz to [[Regensburg]]. In 1803, electorates were created for the [[Rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], the [[Margrave of Baden]], the [[Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]], and the [[Duchy of Salzburg|Duke of Salzburg]], bringing the total number of electors to ten. When [[Austria]] annexed Salzburg under the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)]], the Duke of Salzburg moved to the [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] and retained his electorate. None of the new electors, however, had an opportunity to cast votes, as the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806, and the new electorates were never confirmed by the Emperor.\n\n=== After the Empire ===\n\nAfter the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in August 1806, the Electors continued to reign over their territories, many of them taking higher titles. The Electors of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Saxony styled themselves Kings, while the Electors of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Regensburg]], and [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|W\u00fcrzburg]] became Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hesse-Kassel, however, retained the meaningless title \"Elector of Hesse\", thus distinguishing himself from other Hessian princes (the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt and the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg). Napoleon soon exiled him and Kassel was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], a new creation. The King of Great Britain remained at war with Napoleon and continued to style himself Elector of Hanover, while the Hanoverian government continued to operate in London.\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] accepted the Electors of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Saxony as Kings, along with the newly created Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hanover finally joined his fellow Electors by declaring himself the King of Hanover. The restored Elector of Hesse, a Napoleonic creation, tried to be recognized as the King of the [[Chatti]]. However, the European powers refused to acknowledge this title at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]] and instead listed him with the [[grand duchy|grand dukes]] as a \"Royal Highness\".<ref name=\"satow1932\">{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetodiplomati00satouoft|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London}}</ref> Believing the title of Prince-Elector to be superior in dignity to that of Grand Duke, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel chose to remain an Elector, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor to elect. Hesse-Kassel remained the only Electorate in Germany until 1866, when the country backed the losing side in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was absorbed into Prussia.\n\n==Confessional balance==\n\nReligion was a factor in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor, as some [[Protestant]] electors would refuse to vote for a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[vice versa]]. Most of the time, religion played a minor role and was overshadowed by other factors, including dynastic, territorial and other political interests. For example, the Protestant [[Elector of Saxony]] voted for [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]], putting his political interests first even though Ferdinand was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] who would eventually lead the Empire into the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt the height of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there were times when the electoral college had a Protestant majority. However, all of the Holy Roman Emperors were Catholic. Some historians maintain that [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] had been touched by the Reformed theology and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained nominally Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed.<ref>See Parker, pp. 20\u201350.</ref> Other historians maintain he was as Catholic as his brother, but tended to see religion as outside the political sphere.<ref>Holborn, pp. 250\u2013251.</ref>\n\n===Spiritual===\n\n*The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Elector of Mainz]] was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Trier|Elector of Trier]]  was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]] was usually a [[Roman Catholic]], with the exception of [[Hermann V von Wied]] ([[Lutheran]], 1542\u20131546) and [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg]] ([[Calvinist|Reformed]] 1582\u20131588).\n\n===Secular===\n*The [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Elector of Bohemia]] was usually a [[Roman Catholic]], with the exception of [[George of Podebrady]] ([[Hussite]], 1457\u20131471) and [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick I]] ([[Calvinist|Reformed]], 1619\u20131620).\n*The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]], who was also [[List of monarchs of Prussia|Duke of Prussia]] from 1618 (King in Prussia from 1701, King of Prussia from 1772), was [[Roman Catholic]] until 1539, then [[Lutheran]] until 1613, then [[Calvinist|Reformed]] until the end of the Empire.\n*The [[Electoral Palatinate|Elector Palatine]] was [[Roman Catholic]] until the 1530s, then a [[Lutheran]] until 1559, then a [[Calvinist|Reformed]] until 1575, then again [[Lutheran]] until 1583, then again [[Calvinist|Refomed]] until 1623, when the electoral dignity was lost to [[Electoral Bavaria|Bavaria]].\n*The [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] was [[Roman Catholic]] until 1525, then [[Lutheran]] until 1697, and then again [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n===Added in the 17th century===\n*The [[Electorate of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] was always [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Elector of Hanover]], was [[Lutheran]] until 1714, when he became [[List of British monarchs|King of Great Britain]] and also the head of the [[Anglican]] [[Church of England]].\n\n===Added in the 19th century===\n*The [[Principality of Regensburg|Elector of Regensburg]] [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]] was [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Salzburg|Elector of Salzburg]] (1803\u20131805) and [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] (1805\u20131806) [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III and I]] was [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Elector of W\u00fcrttemberg]] [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]] was [[Lutheran]].\n*The [[Electorate of Baden|Elector of Baden]] [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick]] was [[Lutheran]].\n*The [[Electorate of Hesse|Elector of Hesse]] [[William I, Elector of Hesse|William I]] was [[Calvinist|Reformed]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[Elective monarchy]]\n* [[Electoral Palace (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Electress]]\n* [[Imperial election]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Bryce, J.

The film takes place after the events of [[Avengers: Endgame]], in which the Eternals, who have hidden themselves for thousands of years, must re-unite to protect Earth from their enemies, the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]].\n\nIn April 2018, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] announced that a film based on the Eternals had begun development, with Matthew and Ryan Firpo hired to write the script for the project in May 2018. By late-September, Marvel had hired Zhao to direct the film. [[Principal photography]] began in July 2019, with locations including [[Pinewood Studios]], London and [[Oxford]] in England, and the [[Canary Islands]], lasting until February 2020.\n\n''The Eternals'' is scheduled for release in the United States on February 12, 2021, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter an unexpected tragedy following the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /> the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]\u2014an immortal alien race created by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] who have secretly lived on Earth for over 7000 years<ref name=\"EternalsTimeline\" /><ref name=\"EternalsCCXP\" />\u2014reunite to protect humanity from their evil counterparts, the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]].<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart\" />\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Don Lee & Angelina Jolie (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|The cast of ''The Eternals'' at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do not change.

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as
