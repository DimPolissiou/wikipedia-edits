Utah State University.</ref>\n}}\n'''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''''Habsburg Empire''''') is an [[hyponymy|umbrella term]] used by historians for the numerous lands and kingdoms of the [[Habsburg dynasty]], especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 until 1806 (with the exception of 1742\u20131745) the head of the House of Habsburg was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. \n\nThe formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] as [[King of Germany]] in 1273 and his acquisition of the [[Duchy of Austria]] for his house in 1282. In 1482, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] through marriage. Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who also inherited [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its colonies]] and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Bohemia]] since 1526, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, Burgundy and lands in Italy) went extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary, Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single [[personal union]].\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns\u2014with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself\u2014composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The [[composite state]] became the dominant form of monarchies on the European continent in the early modern era.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Robert I.

Outside the empire it encompassed all the lands of the crown of Hungary, as well as conquests made at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. The dynastic capital was [[Vienna]], except from 1583 to 1611, when it was in [[Prague]].<ref name=HHus/>\n\n==Origins and expansion==\n[[File:Augsburg, Silver Medal 600th Anniversary of 1282 Hoftag, obverse.jpg|left|thumb|Silver medal by [[:de:Anton Scharff|Scharff]] commemorating the 600th anniversary of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1882 (obverse)]]\n\nThe Habsburg family originated with the [[Habsburg Castle]] in modern [[Switzerland]], and after 1279 came to rule in [[Austria]]. The [[Duchy of Austria]] was part of the elective [[Kingdom of Germany]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] of the Habsburg family assigned the [[Duchy of Austria]] to his sons at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1282), thus establishing the \"[[Austrian hereditary lands]]\". From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the [[House of Austria]]. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg [[Archduke of Austria]] was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Maximilian I married [[Mary of Burgundy]], thus bringing the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] into the Habsburg inheritance. Their son, [[Philip the Handsome]], married [[Joanna the Mad]] of Spain (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]). [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (son of Philip and Joanna) inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1506, [[Habsburg Spain]] and its territories in 1516, and [[Habsburg Austria]] in 1519. \n\nAt this point, the Habsburg Empire was so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as [[Isabella of Portugal]] in Spain and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, [[Emperor Charles V]] came to terms with his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. According to the [[Habsburg]] ''compact'' of Worms (1521), confirmed a year later in [[Brussels]], Ferdinand was made [[Archduke]] as a regent of Charles V in the Austrian hereditary lands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]  against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], Archduke Ferdinand (who was his brother-in-law by virtue of an adoption treaty signed by Maximilian and Louis at the [[First Congress of Vienna]]) was also elected the next King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Britannica2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I|title=Ferdinand I|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref><ref name=\"HHus\">\"Czech Republic \u2013 Historic Centre of Prague (1992)\" Heindorffhus, August 2007, [http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm HeindorffHus-Czech] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070320190321/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm |date=2007-03-20 }}.</ref> Bohemia and Hungary became hereditary Habsburg domains only in the 17th century: Following victory in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) over the Bohemian rebels, [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] promulgated a ''Renewed Constitution'' (1627) that established hereditary succession over Bohemoa; and following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1687)|Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1687), in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] reconquered almost all of Hungary from the [[Ottoman Turks]], the emperor held a [[Diet of Hungary|diet in Pressburg]] to establish hereditary succession in the Hungarian kingdom.\n\nCharles V divided the House in 1556 by ceding Austria along with the Imperial crown to Ferdinand (as decided at the [[Imperial election, 1531]]) and the [[Spanish empire]] to his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].

The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the Lands of the Hungarian Crown) was not considered a \"crownland\" after the establishment of Austria-Hungary 1867, so that the \"crownlands\" became identical with what was called the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council (''Die im Reichsrate vertretenen K\u00f6nigreiche und L\u00e4nder'').\n\nThe Hungarian parts of the Empire were called \"[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]\" or \"Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen's Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Heiligen Stephans Krone''). The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called \"Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Wenzels-Krone'').\n\nNames of some smaller territories:\n* Austrian lands (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') or \"Archduchies of Austria\" (''Erzherzogt\u00fcmer von \u00d6sterreich'') \u2013 Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996\u20131918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik \u00d6sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).\n:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state 1 January 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into \"Austria above the Enns\" and \"Austria below the Enns\" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the \"War of the Bavarian Succession\" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] (\"[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter\"), formerly part of Bavaria.\n* [[Hereditary Lands]] (''Erblande'' or ''Erbl\u00e4nder''; mostly used ''\u00d6sterreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] \u2013 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the \"original\" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term \"Crownlands\" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.\n===Territories===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|260px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy in Central Europe]]\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|The Habsburg Monarchy at the time of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s death in 1790. The red line marks the borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nThe territories ruled of the Austrian monarchy changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:\n* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]] and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]].

In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being picked up in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman administration]]).\n*[[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]]\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Europa regina]]'', symbolizing a Habsburg-dominated Europe]]\n[[File:Kraji\u0161nici, 1756. g.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Military Frontier]] against the incursions of the Ottoman Turks, 1756]]\nOver the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundogeniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686\u201391)|Serbia]] occupation (1686\u20131691)\n* [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (1699\u20131868)\n* [[Transylvania|Grand Principality of Transylvania]], between 1699 ([[Treaty of Karlowitz]]) and 1867 ([[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich]])\n* [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713\u20131792)\n* [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713\u20131797)\n* [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713\u20131735)\n* [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Kingdom of Serbia]] (1718\u20131739)\n* [[Banat of Temeswar]] (1718\u20131778)\n* [[Oltenia]] (1718\u20131739 de facto, 1716\u20131737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as ''Valachia Caesarea'')\n* [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720\u20131735)\n* [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735\u20131748)\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772\u20131918)\n* [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774\u20131918)\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia]] occupation (1788\u20131792)\n* [[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Krak\u00f3w]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795\u20131809)\n* [[Venetian Province|Venetia]] (1797\u20131805)\n* [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797\u20131805, 1814\u20131918)\n* [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814\u20131859)\n* [[Krak\u00f3w]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846\u20131918)\n* [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) de facto entity, officially unrecognized\n* [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] (1849\u20131860)\n* [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1868\u20131918)\n* [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] occupation (1878\u20131913)\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878\u20131918).\n\nThe boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.\n\n===Characteristics===\nWithin the early modern Habsburg Monarchy, each entity was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person\u2014junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at [[centralization]] began under [[Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] that followed.\n\nAnother attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, the centralized neo-absolutism tried to as well to nullify Hungary's constitution and Diet. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, these policies were step by step abandoned. \n\nAfter experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\") was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as \"Austria\", received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name \u2013 the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\". When Bosnia and Herzegovina was [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint [[Ministry of Finance (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. After its dissolution, the new republics of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the [[First Hungarian Republic]] were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Other lines==\nA junior line ruled over the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].\n\n==Rulers 1508\u20131918==\n{{main|List of rulers of Austria}}\nThe so-called \"Habsburg monarchs\" or \"Habsburg emperors\" held many different titles and ruled each kingdom with a different name and position.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife Infanta [[Maria of Spain]] with their children]]\n* [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] 1508\u20131519 \n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] 1519\u20131556\n* [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] 1556\u20131564\n* [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] 1564\u20131576\n* [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] 1576\u20131612\n* [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] 1612\u20131619\n* [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] 1619\u20131637\n* [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] 1637\u20131657\n* [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] 1657\u20131705\n* [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] 1705\u20131711\n* [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] 1711\u20131740\n* [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] 1740\u20131780 (German: Maria Theresia)\n\n===Habsburg-Lorraine===\n* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] 1780\u20131790 known as \"the great Reformer\"\n* [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] 1790\u20131792 from 1765 to 1790 \"Grandduke of Tuscany\"\n* [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] 1792\u20131835 correctly written \"Franz\" (became Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1804, at which point numbering starts anew)\n* [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] 1835\u20131848 known as \"Ferdinand the Good\" German: \"Ferdinand der G\u00fctige\"\n* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] 1848\u20131916 Brother of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (ruled 1864\u20131867)\n* [[Karl I of Austria|Charles I]] 1916\u20131918 last reigning Monarch of Austria-Hungary\n* Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen or sometimes called Otto von \u00d6sterreich Crown Prince of Austria to be found as [[Otto von Habsburg]]\n\n===Family tree===\n* [[Habsburg family tree]]\n\n==In literature==\nThe most famous memoir on the decline of the Habsburg Empire is Stefan Zweig's ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.<ref name=\"Manacorda 2010\">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in Roth ''La Marcia di Radetzky'', Newton Classici quotation: {{quotation|Stefan Zweig, l'autore del pi\u00f9 famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, Die Welt von Gestern}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* B\u00e9renger, Jean.

Utah State University.</ref>\n}}\n'''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''''Habsburg Empire''''') is an [[hyponymy|umbrella term]] used by historians for the numerous lands and kingdoms of the [[Habsburg dynasty]], especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 until 1806 (with the exception of 1742\u20131745) the head of the House of Habsburg was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. \n\nThe formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] as [[King of Germany]] in 1273 and his acquisition of the [[Duchy of Austria]] for his house in 1282. In 1482, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] through marriage. Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who also inherited [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its colonies]] and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Bohemia]] since 1526, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, Burgundy and lands in Italy) went extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary, Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single [[personal union]].\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns\u2014with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself\u2014composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The [[composite state]] was the dominant form on the European continent in the early modern era.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Robert I.

Outside the empire it encompassed all the lands of the crown of Hungary, as well as conquests made at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

The [[Duchy of Austria]] was part of the elective [[Kingdom of Germany]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] of the Habsburg family assigned the [[Duchy of Austria]] to his sons at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1282), thus establishing the \"[[Austrian hereditary lands]]\". From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the [[House of Austria]]. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg [[Archduke of Austria]] was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Maximilian I married [[Mary of Burgundy]], thus bringing the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] into the Habsburg inheritance. Their son, [[Philip the Handsome]], married [[Joanna the Mad]] of Spain (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]). [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (son of Philip and Joanna) inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1506, [[Habsburg Spain]] and its territories in 1516, and [[Habsburg Austria]] in 1519. \n\nAt this point, the Habsburg Empire was so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as [[Isabella of Portugal]] in Spain and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, [[Emperor Charles V]] came to terms with his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. According to the [[Habsburg]] ''compact'' of Worms (1521), confirmed a year later in [[Brussels]], Ferdinand was made [[Archduke]] as a regent of Charles V in the Austrian hereditary lands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]  against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], Archduke Ferdinand (who was his brother-in-law by virtue of an adoption treaty signed by Maximilian and Louis at the [[First Congress of Vienna]]) was also elected the next King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Britannica2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I|title=Ferdinand I|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref><ref name=\"HHus\">\"Czech Republic \u2013 Historic Centre of Prague (1992)\" Heindorffhus, August 2007, [http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm HeindorffHus-Czech] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070320190321/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm |date=2007-03-20 }}.</ref> Bohemia and Hungary became hereditary Habsburg domains only in the 17th century: Following victory in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) over the Bohemian rebels, [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] promulgated a ''Renewed Constitution'' (1627) that established hereditary succession over Bohemoa; and following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1687)|Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1687), in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] reconquered almost all of Hungary from the [[Ottoman Turks]], the emperor held a [[Diet of Hungary|diet in Pressburg]] to establish hereditary succession in the Hungarian kingdom.\n\nCharles V divided the House in 1556 by ceding Austria along with the Imperial crown to Ferdinand (as decided at the [[Imperial election, 1531]]) and the [[Spanish empire]] to his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].

The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called \"Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Wenzels-Krone'').\n\nNames of some smaller territories:\n* Austrian lands (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') or \"Archduchies of Austria\" (''Erzherzogt\u00fcmer von \u00d6sterreich'') \u2013 Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996\u20131918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik \u00d6sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).\n:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state 1 January 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into \"Austria above the Enns\" and \"Austria below the Enns\" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the \"War of the Bavarian Succession\" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] (\"[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter\"), formerly part of Bavaria.\n* [[Hereditary Lands]] (''Erblande'' or ''Erbl\u00e4nder''; mostly used ''\u00d6sterreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] \u2013 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the \"original\" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term \"Crownlands\" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.\n===Territories===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|260px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy in Central Europe]]\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|The Habsburg Monarchy at the time of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s death in 1790. The red line marks the borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nThe territories ruled of the Austrian monarchy changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:\n* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]] and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]]. The Hereditary provinces included:\n**[[Archduchy of Austria]] \n*** [[Upper Austria]]\n*** [[Lower Austria]]\n** [[Inner Austria]]\n*** [[Duchy of Styria]]\n*** [[Duchy of Carinthia]]\n*** [[Duchy of Carniola]]\n*** The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] port of [[Trieste]]\n*** [[March of Istria#Habsburg Margraviate|Margraviate of Istria]] (although much of Istria was [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory until 1797)\n*** [[Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca]]\n** [[County of Tyrol]] (although the Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen dominated what would become the South Tyrol before 1803)\n** [[Further Austria]], mostly ruled jointly with Tyrol.\n*** [[Vorarlberg]] (actually a collection of provinces, only united in the 19th century)\n*** The [[Vorlande]], a group of territories in [[Breisgau]] and elsewhere in southwestern Germany lost in 1801 (although the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] territories ([[Sundgau]]) which had formed a part of it had been lost as early as 1648)\n** [[Grand Duchy of Salzburg]] (only after 1805)[[File:Maria Theresa-coronation-1741-Pressburg-Hertz.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Maria Theresa in Pressburg, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], 1741]]\n* The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. The Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] ({{lang-cs|zemsk\u00fd sn\u011bm}}) elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, as king in 1526. Initially consisting of the five lands: \n** [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] \n** [[Margraviate of Moravia]]\n** [[Silesia]], Most of Silesia was conquered by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1740\u20131742 and the remnants which stayed under Habsburg sovereignty were ruled as [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]] (Austrian Silesia).\n** [[Lusatia]], was ceded to [[Saxony]] in 1635.\n*** [[Upper Lusatia]]\n*** [[Lower Lusatia]]\n* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] \u2013 two-thirds of the former territory that was administered by the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Princes of vassal Ottoman [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Transylvania]], while the Habsburg administration was restricted to the western and northern territories of the former kingdom, which remained to be officially referred as the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being picked up in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman administration]]).\n*[[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]]\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Europa regina]]'', symbolizing a Habsburg-dominated Europe]]\n[[File:Kraji\u0161nici, 1756. g.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Military Frontier]] against the incursions of the Ottoman Turks, 1756]]\nOver the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundogeniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686\u201391)|Serbia]] occupation (1686\u20131691)\n* [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (1699\u20131868)\n* [[Transylvania|Grand Principality of Transylvania]], between 1699 ([[Treaty of Karlowitz]]) and 1867 ([[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich]])\n* [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713\u20131792)\n* [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713\u20131797)\n* [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713\u20131735)\n* [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Kingdom of Serbia]] (1718\u20131739)\n* [[Banat of Temeswar]] (1718\u20131778)\n* [[Oltenia]] (1718\u20131739 de facto, 1716\u20131737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as ''Valachia Caesarea'')\n* [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720\u20131735)\n* [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735\u20131748)\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772\u20131918)\n* [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774\u20131918)\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia]] occupation (1788\u20131792)\n* [[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Krak\u00f3w]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795\u20131809)\n* [[Venetian Province|Venetia]] (1797\u20131805)\n* [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797\u20131805, 1814\u20131918)\n* [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814\u20131859)\n* [[Krak\u00f3w]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846\u20131918)\n* [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) de facto entity, officially unrecognized\n* [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] (1849\u20131860)\n* [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1868\u20131918)\n* [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] occupation (1878\u20131913)\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878\u20131918).\n\nThe boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.\n\n===Characteristics===\nWithin the early modern Habsburg Monarchy, each entity was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person\u2014junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at [[centralization]] began under [[Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] that followed.\n\nAnother attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, the centralized neo-absolutism tried to as well to nullify Hungary's constitution and Diet. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, these policies were step by step abandoned. \n\nAfter experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\") was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as \"Austria\", received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name \u2013 the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\". When Bosnia and Herzegovina was [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint [[Ministry of Finance (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. After its dissolution, the new republics of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the [[First Hungarian Republic]] were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Other lines==\nA junior line ruled over the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].\n\n==Rulers 1508\u20131918==\n{{main|List of rulers of Austria}}\nThe so-called \"Habsburg monarchs\" or \"Habsburg emperors\" held many different titles and ruled each kingdom with a different name and position.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife Infanta [[Maria of Spain]] with their children]]\n* [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] 1508\u20131519 \n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] 1519\u20131556\n* [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] 1556\u20131564\n* [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] 1564\u20131576\n* [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] 1576\u20131612\n* [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] 1612\u20131619\n* [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] 1619\u20131637\n* [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] 1637\u20131657\n* [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] 1657\u20131705\n* [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] 1705\u20131711\n* [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] 1711\u20131740\n* [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] 1740\u20131780 (German: Maria Theresia)\n\n===Habsburg-Lorraine===\n* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] 1780\u20131790 known as \"the great Reformer\"\n* [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] 1790\u20131792 from 1765 to 1790 \"Grandduke of Tuscany\"\n* [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] 1792\u20131835 correctly written \"Franz\" (became Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1804, at which point numbering starts anew)\n* [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] 1835\u20131848 known as \"Ferdinand the Good\" German: \"Ferdinand der G\u00fctige\"\n* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] 1848\u20131916 Brother of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (ruled 1864\u20131867)\n* [[Karl I of Austria|Charles I]] 1916\u20131918 last reigning Monarch of Austria-Hungary\n* Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen or sometimes called Otto von \u00d6sterreich Crown Prince of Austria to be found as [[Otto von Habsburg]]\n\n===Family tree===\n* [[Habsburg family tree]]\n\n==In literature==\nThe most famous memoir on the decline of the Habsburg Empire is Stefan Zweig's ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.<ref name=\"Manacorda 2010\">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in Roth ''La Marcia di Radetzky'', Newton Classici quotation: {{quotation|Stefan Zweig, l'autore del pi\u00f9 famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, Die Welt von Gestern}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* B\u00e9renger, Jean.

Much of Amber's current buildings were started or expanded during the reign of Raja Man Singh I in the 1600s. Among the chief building is the Diwan-i-Khas in Amber Palace of Rajasthan and the elaborately painted Ganesh Poll built by the Mirza Raja Jai Singh I.<ref name=DNA/>\n\nThe current Amer Palace was created in the late 16th century, as a larger palace to the already existing home of the rulers. The older palace, known as Kadimi Mahal (Persian for ancient) is known to be the oldest surviving palace in India. This ancient palace sits in the valley behind the Amer Palace.\n\nAmer was known in the medieval period as [[Dhundar]] (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards \u2013 between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer.<ref name=\"KhangarotNathawat1990\">{{cite book|author1=R.

This is one of the four courtyards of Amer Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693\u20131743 AD). Maharaja's personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or ''Fauj Bakshi''. The Maharaja used to inspect the guards contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables, with the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.<ref name=Jaleb>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Jaleb_Chowk_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque at Jaleb Chowk |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===First courtyard===\n[[File:Amer Fort Entrance.jpg|thumb|Ganesh Pol Entrance]]\nAn impressive stairway from Jalebi Chowk leads into the main palace grounds. Here, at the entrance to the right of the stairway steps is the Sila Devi temple where the Rajput Maharajas worshipped, starting with Maharaja Mansingh in the 16th century until the 1980s, when the animal sacrifice ritual (sacrifice of a buffalo) practiced by the royalty was stopped.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nGanesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, named after the [[Hindu god]] [[Lord Ganesh]], who removes all obstacles in life, is the entry into the private palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that were also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621\u20131627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies of the royal family used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through latticed marble windows called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|j\u00e2l\u00ees]]\".<ref name=Jaleb1>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Ganesh_Pol_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque on Ganesh Pol |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n; Sila Devi temple\n[[File: Silver door in Amber Fort, Rajasthan.jpg|left|thumb|Embossed double leaf silver door entry into the Sila Devi temple]]\nOn the right side of the Jalebi Chowk, there is a small but an elegant temple called the Sila Devi temple (Sila Devi was an incarnation of [[Kali]] or [[Durga]]). The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, there is also a carving of [[Lord Ganesha]], which is made out of a single piece of [[coral]].<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nAnother version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone slab which was said to have a link to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story in which [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had killed older siblings of [[Lord Krishna]] on this stone. In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of [[Durga]] [[Mahishasuramardini]], who had slain the demon king [[Mahishasura]] and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of [[Jamwa Ramgarh|Ramgarh]].<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\nAnother practice that is associated with this temple is the religious rites of animal sacrifice during the festival days of [[Navrathri]] (a nine-day festival celebrated twice a year). The practice was to sacrifice a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and also [[goats]] on the eighth day of the festival in front of the temple, which would be done in the presence of the royal family, watched by a large gathering of devotees. This practice was banned under the law from 1975, after which the sacrifice was held within the palace grounds in Jaipur, strictly as a private event with only the close kin of the royal family watching the event. However, now the practice of animal sacrifice has been totally stopped at the temple premises and offerings made to the goddess are only of the vegetarian type.<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\n===Second courtyard===\nThe second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n===Third courtyard===\n[[File:Amber Fort interior.jpg|thumb|Mirrored ceiling in the Mirror Palace]]\n[[File:Amber Fort - Sheesh Mahal Interior.jpg|thumb|Sheesh Mahal Interior]]\nThe third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the [[Mughal Gardens]]. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir, which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a \"glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight\".<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>  Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in the 16th century and completed in 1727. It is also the foundation year of Jaipur state.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=9&name=Sheesh%20mahal%20Amer%20palace|title = Sheesh mahal Amer palace|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = www.amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit Kumar Pareek and Agam kumar}}</ref> However, most of this work was allowed to deteriorate during the period 1970\u201380 but has since then been in the process of restoration and renovation. The walls around the hall hold carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nOn top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and [[alabaster]] relief work.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\nThe other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a [[sandalwood]] door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|ch\u00een\u00ee kh\u00e2na]]\". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.\n\n; Magic flower\nA particular attraction here is the \"magic flower\" carved marble panel at the base of one of the pillars around the mirror palace depicting two hovering butterflies; the flower has seven unique designs including a fishtail, lotus, hooded cobra, elephant trunk, lion's tail, cob of corn, and scorpion, each one of which is visible by a special way of partially hiding the panel with the hands.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\n; Garden\nThe garden, located between the Jai Mandir on the east and the Sukh Niwas on the west, both built on high platforms in the third courtyard, was built by Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1623\u201368). It is patterned on the lines of the Chahar Bagh or Mughal Garden. It is in a sunken bed, shaped in a hexagonal design. It is laid out with narrow channels lined with marble around a star-shaped pool with a fountain at the center. Water for the garden flows in cascades through channels from the Sukh Niwas and also from the cascade channels called the ''\"chini khana niches\"'' that originate on the terrace of the Jai Mandir.<ref name=\"Ruggles2008\"/>\n\n; Tripolia gate\nTripolia gate means three gates. It is access to the palace from the west. It opens in three directions, one to the Jaleb Chowk, another to the Man Singh Palace and the third one to the Zenana Deorhi on the south.\n\n; Lion gate\nThe Lion Gate, the premier gate, was once a guarded gate; it leads to the private quarters in the palace premises and is titled 'Lion Gate' to suggest strength. Built during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh (1699\u20131743 AD), it is covered with frescoes; its alignment is zigzag, probably made so from security considerations to attack intruders.\n\n===Fourth courtyard===\nThe fourth courtyard is where the [[Zenana]] (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n; Palace of Man Singh I\n[[File:Amber_Fort_-_Baradhari_pavlion_at_Man_Singh_Palace_Square.jpg|left|thumb|Baradari pavilion at Man Singh I Palace Square.]]\nSouth of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589\u20131614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared [[Baradari (building)|baradari]] or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.<ref name=\"Abram2003\"/>\n\nThe queen mothers and the Raja's consorts lived in this part of the palace in Zanani Deorhi, which also housed their female attendants. The queen mothers took a deep interest in building temples in Amer town.<ref name=Deorhi>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Zenani_Deorhi_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque on Zenani Deorhi |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nSix forts of Rajasthan, namely, Amber Fort, [[Chittor Fort]], [[Gagron Fort]], [[Jaisalmer Fort]], [[Kumbhalgarh]] and [[Ranthambore Fort]] were included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list during the 37th meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Phnom Penh during June 2013.

The older palace, known as Kadimi Mahal (Persian for ancient) is known to be the oldest surviving palace in India. This ancient palace sits in the valley behind the Amer Palace.\n\nAmer was known in the medieval period as [[Dhundar]] (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards \u2013 between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer.<ref name=\"KhangarotNathawat1990\">{{cite book|author1=R.

The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, there is also a carving of [[Lord Ganesha]], which is made out of a single piece of [[coral]].<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nAnother version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone slab which was said to have a link to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story in which [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had killed older siblings of [[Lord Krishna]] on this stone. In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of [[Durga]] [[Mahishasuramardini]], who had slain the demon king [[Mahishasura]] and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of [[Jamwa Ramgarh|Ramgarh]].<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\nAnother practice that is associated with this temple is the religious rites of animal sacrifice during the festival days of [[Navrathri]] (a nine-day festival celebrated twice a year). The practice was to sacrifice a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and also [[goats]] on the eighth day of the festival in front of the temple, which would be done in the presence of the royal family, watched by a large gathering of devotees. This practice was banned under the law from 1975, after which the sacrifice was held within the palace grounds in Jaipur, strictly as a private event with only the close kin of the royal family watching the event. However, now the practice of animal sacrifice has been totally stopped at the temple premises and offerings made to the goddess are only of the vegetarian type.<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\n===Second courtyard===\nThe second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n===Third courtyard===\n[[File:Amber Fort interior.jpg|thumb|Mirrored ceiling in the Mirror Palace]]\n[[File:Amber Fort - Sheesh Mahal Interior.jpg|thumb|Sheesh Mahal Interior]]\nThe third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the [[Mughal Gardens]]. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir, which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a \"glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight\".<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>  Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in the 16th century and completed in 1727.

The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nOn top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and [[alabaster]] relief work.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\nThe other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a [[sandalwood]] door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|ch\u00een\u00ee kh\u00e2na]]\". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.\n\n; Magic flower\nA particular attraction here is the \"magic flower\" carved marble panel at the base of one of the pillars around the mirror palace depicting two hovering butterflies; the flower has seven unique designs including a fishtail, lotus, hooded cobra, elephant trunk, lion's tail, cob of corn, and scorpion, each one of which is visible by a special way of partially hiding the panel with the hands.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\n; Garden\nThe garden, located between the Jai Mandir on the east and the Sukh Niwas on the west, both built on high platforms in the third courtyard, was built by Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1623\u201368). It is patterned on the lines of the Chahar Bagh or Mughal Garden. It is in a sunken bed, shaped in a hexagonal design. It is laid out with narrow channels lined with marble around a star-shaped pool with a fountain at the center. Water for the garden flows in cascades through channels from the Sukh Niwas and also from the cascade channels called the ''\"chini khana niches\"'' that originate on the terrace of the Jai Mandir.<ref name=\"Ruggles2008\"/>\n\n; Tripolia gate\nTripolia gate means three gates. It is access to the palace from the west. It opens in three directions, one to the Jaleb Chowk, another to the Man Singh Palace and the third one to the Zenana Deorhi on the south.\n\n; Lion gate\nThe Lion Gate, the premier gate, was once a guarded gate; it leads to the private quarters in the palace premises and is titled 'Lion Gate' to suggest strength. Built during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh (1699\u20131743 AD), it is covered with frescoes; its alignment is zigzag, probably made so from security considerations to attack intruders.\n\n===Fourth courtyard===\nThe fourth courtyard is where the [[Zenana]] (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n; Palace of Man Singh I\n[[File:Amber_Fort_-_Baradhari_pavlion_at_Man_Singh_Palace_Square.jpg|left|thumb|Baradari pavilion at Man Singh I Palace Square.]]\nSouth of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589\u20131614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared [[Baradari (building)|baradari]] or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.<ref name=\"Abram2003\"/>\n\nThe queen mothers and the Raja's consorts lived in this part of the palace in Zanani Deorhi, which also housed their female attendants.

He has been a pioneer in several areas of reproductive biology, including evolution of sexual behavior and differentiation, neural and phenotypic plasticity, and the role of endocrine disruptors on brain and behavior.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate [[Niko Tinbergen]] posited that to understand the behavior of any animal (including humans)  requires analysis of its Ontogeny (development within the individual), Causation (mechanism underlying the display), Ecology (adaptive significance), and Evolution (change through time).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tinbergen|first1=Niko|title=On Aims and Methods of Ethology|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Tierpsychologie|date=1963|volume=20|issue=4|pages=410\u2013433|url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/bard/pdf/week_02_tinbergen_on_aims_and_methods_of_ethology_zft_1963.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528091716/http://www.rockefeller.edu/bard/pdf/week_02_tinbergen_on_aims_and_methods_of_ethology_zft_1963.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-05-28|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x}}</ref> Dr. Crews strives to utilize all four elements in his research, and exemplifies how a comparative, interdisciplinary approach can integrate molecular through evolutionary levels of analysis. His field and laboratory research has revealed how the causal mechanisms and functional outcomes of reproductive processes operate at each level of biological organization while, at the same time, illuminating the relations among the levels.\n\n==Biography==\n\nDavid Pafford Crews was born April 18, 1947 in Jacksonville, Florida. As a child, most of his time involved reading, fishing and \u201ccatching critters.\u201d These experiences influenced his life's work, and led to the foundation of Reptile Conservation International.\n\n===Education===\nGrowing up in a military family, he spent his childhood at multiple Air Force bases across the globe. This effectively meant that he was in a new school each year and promptly failed most of his coursework due to lack of interest. Because of his low performance in school, he was not accepted to any university in the United States.  Fortunately, his father was transferred to Germany and, as a dependent, entitled to enroll at the Munich Campus of [[the University of Maryland]].  College proved interesting and, in 1967, he transferred  to the College Park campus, graduating with a B.A. (Psychology and Sociology majors) in 1969. Following a summer as a Research Assistant at [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] in the Department of Experimental Psychology sponsored by William Hodos, he decided to pursue a degree in Psychology.<ref name=\"David Crews CV\">{{cite web|title=David Crews Curriculum Vitae|url=https://www.utexas.edu/research/crewslab/curriculum_vitae.htm|website=The Reproductive Biology Laboratory of David Crews|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nDr. Crews received a Ph.D. in Psychobiology as a [[National Institute of Mental Health]] Predoctoral Trainee at the Institute of Animal Behavior at [[Rutgers University]] in 1973 under the mentorship of [[Daniel S. Lehrman]] and [[Jay S. Rosenblatt]]. He completed a [[National Science Foundation]] Postdoctoral Fellowship  mentored by Paul Licht at the Department of Integrative Biology at [[the University of California, Berkeley]] until 1975. This was followed by a NIMH Postdoctoral Fellowship with Ernest E. Williams at Harvard University.<ref name=\"David Crews CV\"/>\n\n===Academic===\nHis first faculty appointment (1975) was as a Lecturer, and promoted to Assistant Professor in 1976 in the Departments of Biology and Psychology at [[Harvard University]]; promotion to Associate Professor followed (1979). Throughout his tenure he was  an Associate at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].  In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Department of Zoology (now Integrative Biology)  at the University of Texas at Austin; he became the Ashbel Smith Professor of Zoology and Psychology in 1998.<ref name=\"David Crews CV\"/>\n\n==Research==\nCrews' research has taken advantage of Nature's own experiments to identify important problems or gaps, adding to our fundamental understanding of reproductive biology and behavior. Through his studies he has uncovered the principles and constraints imposed by diverse reproductive strategies that have led to the evolution of neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying species-typical reproductive behaviors.\n\n===Origin of Sexual Behavior===\n\nCrew extended his investigations to address the origin of sexual behavior. Through both empirical and scholarly research he has argued that the primary function of sexual behavior, namely the stimulation and coordination of the reproductive physiologies of the interacting individuals (usually male and female), originated with the first unicellular organisms and hence predates the evolution of sexual recombination. As mentioned, Crews has challenged the Organizational/Default doctrine of sex determination, extending it to sexual differentiation of the brain and arguing for its replacement with an Ancestral (female)/Derived (male) paradigm. This concept has led to questions such as why might males be more like females than females are like males? The utility of this concept is becoming apparent as we continue to gather evidence for gender differences in genetic and mental disorders. He also has been a major player in the area of the evolution and diversity of steroid hormone receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=The hormonal control of behavior in a lizard|journal=Scientific American|date=1979|volume=241|issue=2|pages=180\u2013187|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0879-180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Moore|first2=Michael C.|title=Evolution of mechanisms controlling mating behavior|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=231|issue=4734|pages=121\u2013125|doi=10.1126/science.3941893}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Animal sexuality|journal=Scientific American|date=1994|volume=270|issue=1|pages=108\u2013114|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0194-108}}</ref>\n\n====Red-sided Garter====\n\nDr. Crews discovered the important principle that sexual behavior, gamete production, and steroid hormone secretion could be dissociated, in his studies of the [[Common Garter Snake|red-sided garter snake]] (''T. s. parietalis''). These snakes are the northernmost reptile and hibernate for much of the year, responding to temperature both to emerge from winter dormancy and to engage in sexual behavior. It was his work with this species that provided the first demonstration that the activation of sexual behavior could be independent of sex steroid hormones, depending instead upon increasing spring temperature. This work also led to the first isolation, identification and synthesis of a new class of pheromones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Garstka|first2=William R.|title=The Ecological Physiology of a Garter Snake|journal=Scientific American|date=1982|volume=247|issue=5|pages=158\u2013168|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1182-158}}</ref>\n\n====Whiptail Lizard====\n\nThe [[Desert grassland whiptail lizard|whiptail lizard]] (''A. uniparens''), presented an opportunity to study first-hand how the neuroendocrine substrates underlying sexual behavior can evolve. In this instance, Dr. Crews used a parthenogenetic species derived from interbreeding of two sexual species. Remarkably, although the descendant species consists only of females, reproducing by obligate parthenogenesis, individuals continue to display sexual behaviors that are typical of both females and males, alternating behaviors depending upon their individual hormone profiles across reproductive cycles. Although it is not immediately apparent what benefit could come of females engaging in male-typical behaviors in a parthenogenetic species, Dr. Crews has shown that this behavior is important to stimulate reproduction of both individuals in these pairings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Courtship in unisexual lizards: A model for brain evolution|journal=Scientific American|date=1987|volume=257|issue=6|pages=116\u2013121|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1287-116}}</ref>\n\nBy comparing the unisexual descendants with their sexual ancestors, Dr. Crews revealed how hormone-brain controlling mechanisms evolve. This work led to the examination of how novel hormone-brain controlling mechanisms might respond to new challenges. Of particular note is the revelation that the male-typical sexual behaviors which parthenogenetic females display turn out to be under the control of the postovulatory surge of progesterone rather than androgen, which the parthenogens do not produce. This discovery in the parthenogenetic lizard led Dr. Crews to extend his work to genetically-modified mice and rats, demonstrating that progesterone is not a \u201cfemale-specific\u201d hormone but plays a critical role in sexual behavior in males. Indeed, Crews demonstrated that androgen and progesterone synergize in males to control copulatory behavior much as estrogen and progesterone synergize in females to facilitate sexual receptivity. These discoveries have shed light on recent work in humans suggesting a clinical significance of progesterone in male sexual behavior.\n\n====Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination====\n\nCrew has been the leader in determining the physiological and molecular bases of [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] (TSD). Sex determination is a case study in how evolution has produced different mechanisms for achieving the same end. In many reptiles the sex of the offspring depends on the incubation temperature of the egg, not on genotype as in mammals. One question concerns how the physical stimulus of temperature is transduced into a molecular and physiological stimulus to determine an individual\u2019s gonadal sex. Dr. Crews demonstrated that incubation temperature acts on a group of genes homologous to those in mammals that affect gonadal differentiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shoemaker|first1=Christina M.|last2=Crews|first2=David|title=Analyzing the coordinated gene network underlying temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles|journal=Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology|date=2009|volume=20|issue=3|pages=293\u2013303|doi=10.1016/j.semcdb.2008.10.010|pmid=19022389|pmc=2729108}}</ref> This work helped overturn the classic tenet that males are the \u201corganized\u201d sex and females the \u201cdefault\u201d sex. Today we recognize both sexes as organized and the question now becomes how the activation of a conserved network of genes leads to a binary response (ovary or testis).\n\n====Leopard Gecko====\n\nHe is a pioneer in the relatively new field (actually rebirth) of phenotypic plasticity, or the process by which the environment induces different phenotypes from a given genotype. When considering that species without sex chromosomes possess all of the genes necessary to develop the phenotype of both sexes, it becomes apparent that the process of sex determination and sexual differentiation represents a form of phenotypic plasticity. Using the [[leopard gecko]] (''E. macularius'') as the animal model system, Dr. Crews determined how the experience of temperature during a narrowly defined period of embryogenesis affects the total phenotype of the adult organism, accounting for much of the variation observed among individuals in morphology, growth, endocrinology, neural activity, and neuroanatomy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gutzke|first1=William H.|last2=Crews|first2=David|title=Embryonic temperature determines adult sexuality in a reptile|journal=Nature|date=1988|volume=332|issue=6167|pages=832\u2013834|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19797868|doi=10.1038/332832a0|pmid=3357551}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=Malcolm W.|title=In Lizards, Eggs' Heat Linked to Behavior|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/10/science/in-lizards-eggs-heat-linked-to-behavior.html|work=The New York TImes|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref> Some sociosexual behaviors and brain measures are affected directly by incubation temperature, whereas both incubation temperature as well as gonadal sex influences others.\n\n===Epigenetics===\n\nIn the past decade Dr. Crews made seminal contributions to the emerging area of behavioral [[epigenetics]]. He was the first to demonstrate that behavioral differences among genetically modified mice may be exaggerated or blurred by the postnatal environment. For example, mice develop in litters of varying sex ratios and genotypes, and it is possible that some of the diagnostic behavioral characteristics may result from an interaction of the sex ratio and genotype ratio of the litter.

Context-dependent epigenetic change occurs as a consequence of exposure. A defining element is that this type of change requires continued exposure to the environmental insult.  For example, environmental factors that bring about an epigenetic modification may simply continue to persist. Should the diet, behavior, or a toxic environmental exposure continues across generations, the epigenetic modification will manifest in each generation. Such environmentally induced epigenetic state(s) can be reversed by removal or alteration of the factor, addition of a different environmental factor, or emigration from the contaminated site. Another form of epigenetic modification may occur when the change in the epigenome is incorporated into the germline, a process Dr. Crews has termed germline-dependent epigenetic change. In this type, the effect manifests in each generation even in the absence of the causative agent. Context-dependent epigenetic modification is fundamentally different from germline-dependent epigenetic modification. Although both have been attributed with \u201ctransgenerational\u201d properties, only in the latter (germline) instance will the trait be passed to the next generation even in the absence of any continued exposures or stimuli. Taken together this work has generated a new perspective on the old question of \u2018inherited vs experienced, ancestral vs acquired, or nature vs nurture\u2019 and promises to shed new light on health management strategy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Epigenetic Modifications of Brain and Behavior: Theory and Practice|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=2011|volume=59|issue=3|pages=393\u2013398|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.07.001|pmid=20633562|pmc=3401366}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental Issues===\n\nWith Dr. Andrea Gore (the University of Texas at Austin, College of Pharmacy), Dr. Crews has explored the reality of living in a contaminated world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Gore|first2=Andrea C.|title=Life Imprints: Living in a Contaminated World|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=2011|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1208\u20131210|doi=10.1289/ehp.1103451|pmid=21571618|pmc=3230404}}</ref> Here they show the links between nature and nurture need to be redefined to accommodate anthropogenic chemical contamination. The fact is that at the global level environmental recovery is not possible. In recognizing and accepting this worldwide change, the types of adaptations that have occurred as a consequence must be considered. In addition, they proposed a fundamental shift in the field that integrates various disciplines involved in the study of environmental contamination to recognize that contamination is widespread and cannot be remedied at the global level. Thus, greater effort must be placed on integrative and interdisciplinary studies that explicitly illuminate how the causal mechanisms and functional outcomes of related processes operate at each level of biological organization while at the same time revealing the relations among the levels. This article caused a good deal of comment, and with analysis now extending to the problem of evolution in a contaminated world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Gore|first2=Andrea C.|title=Epigenetic synthesis: a need for a new paradigm for evolution in a contaminated world|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|date=2012|volume=4|pages=18|doi=10.3410/B4-18|pmid=22991583|pmc=3434969}}</ref> Here they discuss how epigenetic outcomes at the level of both the individual organism and the evolution of the population has created \u2018new species\u2019.\n\n===Educational Impact===\n\nDr. Crew has had a significant impact on science and our understanding of nature. Introductory textbooks in biology, psychology, ecology, evolution, and neuroscience use his work to illustrate various principles; indeed his work has penetrated to the high school textbook level. His work is also frequently seen in film and television programs and has been featured in several articles and texts in the philosophy of science (e.g., Writing Biology by Greg Myers). Lastly, he has played a major role in the mentoring of undergraduates in research, many of whom have gone on to research in medicine and various academic careers. This mainly has been via a vehicle of his own making, the Undergraduate Biomedical Training Program, initiated while he was at Harvard University and continued to this day at the University of Texas at Austin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Biomedical Training Program The University of Texas at Austin|url=http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~crewslab/ubtp.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021009234318/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~crewslab/ubtp.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 October 2002|website=The Reproductive Biology Laboratory of David Crews|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref> This program has graduated over 54 students, many of whom are active researchers today, and produced more than 80 original papers with the students as authors, in many cases as first author.\n\n==Honors and awards==\n\n*Daniel S.

His field and laboratory research has revealed how the causal mechanisms and functional outcomes of reproductive processes operate at each level of biological organization while, at the same time, illuminating the relations among the levels.\n\n==Biography==\n\nDavid Pafford Crews was born April 18, 1947 in Jacksonville, Florida. As a child, most of his time involved reading, fishing and \u201ccatching critters.\u201d These experiences influenced his life's work, and led to the foundation of Reptile Conservation International.\n\n===Education===\nGrowing up in a military family, he spent his childhood at multiple Air Force bases across the globe. This effectively meant that he was in a new school each year and promptly failed most of his coursework due to lack of interest. Because of his low performance in school, he was not accepted to any university in the United States.  Fortunately, his father was transferred to Germany and, as a dependent, entitled to enroll at the Munich Campus of [[the University of Maryland]].  College proved interesting and, in 1967, he transferred  to the College Park campus, graduating with a B.A. (Psychology and Sociology majors) in 1969. Following a summer as a Research Assistant at [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] in the Department of Experimental Psychology sponsored by William Hodos, he decided to pursue a degree in Psychology.<ref name=\"David Crews CV\">{{cite web|title=David Crews Curriculum Vitae|url=https://www.utexas.edu/research/crewslab/curriculum_vitae.htm|website=The Reproductive Biology Laboratory of David Crews|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nDr. Crews received a Ph.D. in Psychobiology as a [[National Institute of Mental Health]] Predoctoral Trainee at the Institute of Animal Behavior at [[Rutgers University]] in 1973 under the mentorship of [[Daniel S. Lehrman]] and [[Jay S. Rosenblatt]]. He completed a [[National Science Foundation]] Postdoctoral Fellowship  mentored by Paul Licht at the Department of Integrative Biology at [[the University of California, Berkeley]] until 1975. This was followed by a NIMH Postdoctoral Fellowship with Ernest E. Williams at Harvard University.<ref name=\"David Crews CV\"/>\n\n===Academic===\nHis first faculty appointment (1975) was as a Lecturer, and promoted to Assistant Professor in 1976 in the Departments of Biology and Psychology at [[Harvard University]]; promotion to Associate Professor followed (1979). Throughout his tenure he was  an Associate at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].  In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Department of Zoology (now Integrative Biology)  at the University of Texas at Austin; he became the Ashbel Smith Professor of Zoology and Psychology in 1998.<ref name=\"David Crews CV\"/>\n\n==Research==\nCrews' research has taken advantage of Nature's own experiments to identify important problems or gaps, adding to our fundamental understanding of reproductive biology and behavior. Through his studies he has uncovered the principles and constraints imposed by diverse reproductive strategies that have led to the evolution of neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying species-typical reproductive behaviors.\n\n===Origin of Sexual Behavior===\n\nCrew extended his investigations to address the origin of sexual behavior. Through both empirical and scholarly research he has argued that the primary function of sexual behavior, namely the stimulation and coordination of the reproductive physiologies of the interacting individuals (usually male and female), originated with the first unicellular organisms and hence predates the evolution of sexual recombination. As mentioned, Crews has challenged the Organizational/Default doctrine of sex determination, extending it to sexual differentiation of the brain and arguing for its replacement with an Ancestral (female)/Derived (male) paradigm. This concept has led to questions such as why might males be more like females than females are like males? The utility of this concept is becoming apparent as we continue to gather evidence for gender differences in genetic and mental disorders. He also has been a major player in the area of the evolution and diversity of steroid hormone receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=The hormonal control of behavior in a lizard|journal=Scientific American|date=1979|volume=241|issue=2|pages=180\u2013187|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0879-180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Moore|first2=Michael C.|title=Evolution of mechanisms controlling mating behavior|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=231|issue=4734|pages=121\u2013125|doi=10.1126/science.3941893}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Animal sexuality|journal=Scientific American|date=1994|volume=270|issue=1|pages=108\u2013114|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0194-108}}</ref>\n\n====Red-sided Garter====\n\nDr. Crews discovered the important principle that sexual behavior, gamete production, and steroid hormone secretion could be dissociated, in his studies of the [[Common Garter Snake|red-sided garter snake]] (''T. s. parietalis''). These snakes are the northernmost reptile and hibernate for much of the year, responding to temperature both to emerge from winter dormancy and to engage in sexual behavior. It was his work with this species that provided the first demonstration that the activation of sexual behavior could be independent of sex steroid hormones, depending instead upon increasing spring temperature. This work also led to the first isolation, identification and synthesis of a new class of pheromones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Garstka|first2=William R.|title=The Ecological Physiology of a Garter Snake|journal=Scientific American|date=1982|volume=247|issue=5|pages=158\u2013168|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1182-158}}</ref>\n\n====Whiptail Lizard====\n\nThe [[Desert grassland whiptail lizard|whiptail lizard]] (''A. uniparens''), presented an opportunity to study first-hand how the neuroendocrine substrates underlying sexual behavior can evolve. In this instance, Dr. Crews used a parthenogenetic species derived from interbreeding of two sexual species. Remarkably, although the descendant species consists only of females, reproducing by obligate parthenogenesis, individuals continue to display sexual behaviors that are typical of both females and males, alternating behaviors depending upon their individual hormone profiles across reproductive cycles. Although it is not immediately apparent what benefit could come of females engaging in male-typical behaviors in a parthenogenetic species, Dr. Crews has shown that this behavior is important to stimulate reproduction of both individuals in these pairings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Courtship in unisexual lizards: A model for brain evolution|journal=Scientific American|date=1987|volume=257|issue=6|pages=116\u2013121|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1287-116}}</ref>\n\nBy comparing the unisexual descendants with their sexual ancestors, Dr. Crews revealed how hormone-brain controlling mechanisms evolve. This work led to the examination of how novel hormone-brain controlling mechanisms might respond to new challenges. Of particular note is the revelation that the male-typical sexual behaviors which parthenogenetic females display turn out to be under the control of the postovulatory surge of progesterone rather than androgen, which the parthenogens do not produce. This discovery in the parthenogenetic lizard led Dr. Crews to extend his work to genetically-modified mice and rats, demonstrating that progesterone is not a \u201cfemale-specific\u201d hormone but plays a critical role in sexual behavior in males. Indeed, Crews demonstrated that androgen and progesterone synergize in males to control copulatory behavior much as estrogen and progesterone synergize in females to facilitate sexual receptivity. These discoveries have shed light on recent work in humans suggesting a clinical significance of progesterone in male sexual behavior.\n\n====Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination====\n\nCrew has been the leader in determining the physiological and molecular bases of [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] (TSD). Sex determination is a case study in how evolution has produced different mechanisms for achieving the same end. In many reptiles the sex of the offspring depends on the incubation temperature of the egg, not on genotype as in mammals. One question concerns how the physical stimulus of temperature is transduced into a molecular and physiological stimulus to determine an individual\u2019s gonadal sex. Dr. Crews demonstrated that incubation temperature acts on a group of genes homologous to those in mammals that affect gonadal differentiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shoemaker|first1=Christina M.|last2=Crews|first2=David|title=Analyzing the coordinated gene network underlying temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles|journal=Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology|date=2009|volume=20|issue=3|pages=293\u2013303|doi=10.1016/j.semcdb.2008.10.010|pmid=19022389|pmc=2729108}}</ref> This work helped overturn the classic tenet that males are the \u201corganized\u201d sex and females the \u201cdefault\u201d sex. Today we recognize both sexes as organized and the question now becomes how the activation of a conserved network of genes leads to a binary response (ovary or testis).\n\n====Leopard Gecko====\n\nHe is a pioneer in the relatively new field (actually rebirth) of phenotypic plasticity, or the process by which the environment induces different phenotypes from a given genotype. When considering that species without sex chromosomes possess all of the genes necessary to develop the phenotype of both sexes, it becomes apparent that the process of sex determination and sexual differentiation represents a form of phenotypic plasticity. Using the [[leopard gecko]] (''E. macularius'') as the animal model system, Dr. Crews determined how the experience of temperature during a narrowly defined period of embryogenesis affects the total phenotype of the adult organism, accounting for much of the variation observed among individuals in morphology, growth, endocrinology, neural activity, and neuroanatomy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gutzke|first1=William H.|last2=Crews|first2=David|title=Embryonic temperature determines adult sexuality in a reptile|journal=Nature|date=1988|volume=332|issue=6167|pages=832\u2013834|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19797868|doi=10.1038/332832a0|pmid=3357551}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=Malcolm W.|title=In Lizards, Eggs' Heat Linked to Behavior|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/10/science/in-lizards-eggs-heat-linked-to-behavior.html|work=The New York TImes|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref> Some sociosexual behaviors and brain measures are affected directly by incubation temperature, whereas both incubation temperature as well as gonadal sex influences others.\n\n===Epigenetics===\n\nIn the past decade Dr. Crews made seminal contributions to the emerging area of behavioral [[epigenetics]]. He was the first to demonstrate that behavioral differences among genetically modified mice may be exaggerated or blurred by the postnatal environment. For example, mice develop in litters of varying sex ratios and genotypes, and it is possible that some of the diagnostic behavioral characteristics may result from an interaction of the sex ratio and genotype ratio of the litter. By varying sex ratios and genotypes, he was able to show that the diagnostic behavioral characteristics and their underlying neural activity result from an interaction of sex and genotype ratio of the litter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Rushworth|first2=David|last3=Gonzalez-Lima|first3=Francisco|last4=Ogawa|first4=Sonoko|title=Litter Environment Affects Behavior and Brain Metabolic Activity of Adult Knockout Mice|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=3|page=12|doi=10.3389/neuro.08.012.2009|pmid=19707539|pmc=2730751}}</ref> This type of work calls attention to the need for researchers using [[genetically modified animal]] models to consider the context in which the phenotypes emerge.\n\n====Transgenerational Epigenetics====\n\nDr. Crews discovered that the [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|transgenerational epigenetic modification]] caused by [[Vinclozolin]] exposure changes the way rats three generations removed (F3) from the original exposure perceive and react to conspecifics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Gore|first2=Andrea C.|last3=Hsu|first3=Timothy S.|last4=Dangleben|first4=Nygerma L.|last5=Spinetta|first5=Michael|last6=Schallert|first6=Timothy|last7=Anway|first7=Matthew D.|last8=Skinner|first8=Michael K.|title=Transgenerational epigenetic imprints on mate preference|journal=PNAS|date=2007|volume=104|issue=14|pages=5942\u20135946|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610410104|pmid=17389367|pmc=1851596}}</ref> This was the first demonstration that [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs) can promote a transgenerational alteration in the epigenome that influences sexual selection, and possibly affect the viability of a population and evolution of the species.

Context-dependent epigenetic change occurs as a consequence of exposure. A defining element is that this type of change requires continued exposure to the environmental insult.  For example, environmental factors that bring about an epigenetic modification may simply continue to persist. Should the diet, behavior, or a toxic environmental exposure continues across generations, the epigenetic modification will manifest in each generation. Such environmentally induced epigenetic state(s) can be reversed by removal or alteration of the factor, addition of a different environmental factor, or emigration from the contaminated site. Another form of epigenetic modification may occur when the change in the epigenome is incorporated into the germline, a process Dr. Crews has termed germline-dependent epigenetic change. In this type, the effect manifests in each generation even in the absence of the causative agent. Context-dependent epigenetic modification is fundamentally different from germline-dependent epigenetic modification. Although both have been attributed with \u201ctransgenerational\u201d properties, only in the latter (germline) instance will the trait be passed to the next generation even in the absence of any continued exposures or stimuli. Taken together this work has generated a new perspective on the old question of \u2018inherited vs experienced, ancestral vs acquired, or nature vs nurture\u2019 and promises to shed new light on health management strategy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Epigenetic Modifications of Brain and Behavior: Theory and Practice|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=2011|volume=59|issue=3|pages=393\u2013398|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.07.001|pmid=20633562|pmc=3401366}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental Issues===\n\nWith Dr. Andrea Gore (the University of Texas at Austin, College of Pharmacy), Dr. Crews has explored the reality of living in a contaminated world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Gore|first2=Andrea C.|title=Life Imprints: Living in a Contaminated World|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=2011|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1208\u20131210|doi=10.1289/ehp.1103451|pmid=21571618|pmc=3230404}}</ref> Here they show the links between nature and nurture need to be redefined to accommodate anthropogenic chemical contamination. The fact is that at the global level environmental recovery is not possible. In recognizing and accepting this worldwide change, the types of adaptations that have occurred as a consequence must be considered. In addition, they proposed a fundamental shift in the field that integrates various disciplines involved in the study of environmental contamination to recognize that contamination is widespread and cannot be remedied at the global level. Thus, greater effort must be placed on integrative and interdisciplinary studies that explicitly illuminate how the causal mechanisms and functional outcomes of related processes operate at each level of biological organization while at the same time revealing the relations among the levels. This article caused a good deal of comment, and with analysis now extending to the problem of evolution in a contaminated world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|last2=Gore|first2=Andrea C.|title=Epigenetic synthesis: a need for a new paradigm for evolution in a contaminated world|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|date=2012|volume=4|pages=18|doi=10.3410/B4-18|pmid=22991583|pmc=3434969}}</ref> Here they discuss how epigenetic outcomes at the level of both the individual organism and the evolution of the population has created \u2018new species\u2019.\n\n===Educational Impact===\n\nDr. Crew has had a significant impact on science and our understanding of nature. Introductory textbooks in biology, psychology, ecology, evolution, and neuroscience use his work to illustrate various principles; indeed his work has penetrated to the high school textbook level. His work is also frequently seen in film and television programs and has been featured in several articles and texts in the philosophy of science (e.g., Writing Biology by Greg Myers). Lastly, he has played a major role in the mentoring of undergraduates in research, many of whom have gone on to research in medicine and various academic careers. This mainly has been via a vehicle of his own making, the Undergraduate Biomedical Training Program, initiated while he was at Harvard University and continued to this day at the University of Texas at Austin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Biomedical Training Program The University of Texas at Austin|url=http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~crewslab/ubtp.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021009234318/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~crewslab/ubtp.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 October 2002|website=The Reproductive Biology Laboratory of David Crews|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref> This program has graduated over 54 students, many of whom are active researchers today, and produced more than 80 original papers with the students as authors, in many cases as first author.\n\n==Honors and awards==\n\n*Daniel S.

Textile Technology Index. EBSCO.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn order to understand the Fast Fashion industry and how it became a global phenomenon, it\u2019s essential to first look at the context of its history and origins. Before the 1800s, fashion was an extensive and almost primitive process where one had to source materials like wool or leather, prepare and weave them into garments. However, the Industrial Revolution revolutionized the world of fashion by introducing new technology \u2013 like the sewing machine, textile machines, ready-made clothing factories and mass production of clothes. All of this resulted in clothes becoming cheaper, easier and quicker to make. Meanwhile, localized dressmaking businesses started to emerge to cater to the middle classes, and they employed workroom employees along with garment workers, who worked from home for meagre wages. These types of operations would, later on, lead to the growth of the \u2018sweatshops\u2019 that would provide the basis of modern clothing production <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goodonyou.eco/what-is-fast-fashion/|title=What Is Fast Fashion?|date=2018-08-07|website=Good On You|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. During World War II, the trend of more functional styles and fabric restrictions led to the standardized production of clothes. Once the middle-class consumers got accustomed to it, they became more receptive to the idea of mass-produced clothing.\n\nThe fashion industry produced and ran clothes for four seasons a year: fall, winter, spring and summer up until the mid-twentieth century, and the designers would work many months in advance to predict and strategize what the customers would want. It was in the 1960s and 1970s that this method changed drastically when the young generation started to create new trends and used cheaply-made clothing as a form of personal expression. Although most fashion brands tried to find ways of keeping up with the increasing demand for affordable clothes, there was still a clear distinction between the high-end and high street fashion. It was only in the late 1990s and 2000s that the notion of low-cost fashion reached its peak when fast fashion retailers like [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], [[H&M]], [[Topshop]] and [[Primark]] took over high street fashion. Initially starting as small stores located in Europe, they were able to infiltrate and gain prominence in the American market by examining and replicating the looks and design elements from runway shows and top fashion houses and quickly reproducing and selling them at a fraction of a cost<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion|title=Fashion History Lesson: The Origins of Fast Fashion|last=Idacavage|first=Sara|website=Fashionista|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>.\n\n=== Big Players of the Fast Fashion movement ===\nWhen it comes to question of who was the pioneer of the Fast Fashion phenomenon, it is difficult to pinpoint one particular brand or company. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that suggest the popular fashion brands that helped start the phenomenon. [[Amancio Ortega]], founder of [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], founded his clothing company in 1963 in a place called [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and it featured products that were affordable replications of popular higher-end clothing fashions in addition to producing its own unique designs. Later on in 1975 Ortega opened the first retail outlet in Europe in order to sell his collections in the short run and also to integrate production and distribution in the long run. He eventually was able to move to New York in the early 1990s where the ''New York Times'' first coined the term \u201cfast fashion\u201d to describe the mission of his store which said that \u201cit would only take 15 days for a garment to go from a designer's brain to being sold on the racks\u201d<ref name=\":4\" />. In the article ''\u201cFast Fashion Lessons\u201d''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sull|first=Donald|last2=Turconi|first2=Stefano|date=2008|title=Fast fashion lessons|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8616.2008.00527.x|journal=Business Strategy Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=4\u201311|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8616.2008.00527.x|issn=1467-8616}}</ref> Donald Sull and Stefano Turconi studies how Zara pioneered an approach to navigate the volatile world of the fast fashion industry. According to Sull and Turconi one of the reasons for Zara\u2019s success was that it built a [[supply chain]] and production network where they maintained complicated and capital-intensive operations (like computer-guided fabric cutting) in-house, while it outsourced labor intensive operations (like garment sewing) to a network of local subcontractors and seamstress operatives based in Galicia. Thus with shorter [[Lead time|lead times]] the company was able to respond very quickly when the sale of their products exceeded their expectations and also cut off production for items that didn\u2019t have very high demands. Unlike many fashion companies, Zara hardly invests in television or press promotional campaigns and instead relies on store windows to convey the brand image, spread of word-of-mouth and locating their shops strategically in areas with high consumer traffic.\n\nSimilar to Zara, the origin story of H&M also has common traits and technically it has also been the longest running retailer. In 1946 [[Erling Persson]], a Swedish entrepreneur, goes on a trip to the USA where he was greatly intrigued and impressed by the concept of efficient and high-volume production stores that he witnessed in New York. The following year in 1947 Persson establishes a women\u2019s wear store called Hennes (which is Swedish for \u201cHers\u201d) & Mauritz (also commonly known as [[H&M]]) in [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Sweden and then between the years of 1960 and 1979 the company rapidly expands not only in terms of location, with 42 stores across Europe, but also in terms of its clothing to include the whole family. The initial foundation for its global expansion is laid when in the 1980s H&M decides to acquire Rowells, a Swedish mail order company, and use it to shift the sale of their fashion products directly into the customer\u2019s homes. After that in the 1990s H&M decides to invest and capitalize on the transition to large city billboard advertising for their products by using famous celebrities and supermodels wearing their clothes. Finally H&M opens its first flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York in 2000, which marked the commencement of its international expansion outside of Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hmgroup.com/about-us/history.html|title=H&M group {{!}} History|website=hmgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Zaw Thiha Tun examines the secret of H&M\u2019s success as a company and mentions that the distinct business model of H&M is unlike Zara since they don\u2019t manufacture any of their products in-house. Rather it outsources its production to more than 900 independent suppliers that are mainly located in Europe and Asia and overseen by 30 strategically located oversight offices. At the same time it primarily depends on its state-of-the-art IT infrastructure and network to connect between the central national office and the production offices. This fact proves to be very crucial to their operations since they don\u2019t own factories or secure the fabrics in advance, and thus they have been able to reduce their lead times through continuous developments in the buying process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/041216/hm-secret-its-success.asp|title=H&M: The Secret to Its Success|last=Tun|first=Zaw Thiha|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>However, if one looks through the annual reports of Zara or H&M, they will find a lot of [[Greenwashing]] throughout their reports. This stems from the greater awareness among people about the damage that fast fashion does to the environment. Therefore, both the brands ''try''  to create chatter about sustainability, but their processes do not reflect any truth. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static.inditex.com/annual_report_2018/pdfs/en/Inditex%20Annual%20Report%202018.pdf|title=Inditex Annual Report 2018|last=ZaraAnnualReport|first=|date=2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\n[[File:H&MdowntownMontreal.jpg|thumb|right|A H&M store in Downtown [[Montreal]]]]\nFast fashion brands produce pieces to get the newest style on the market as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html|title=How Fast Fashion Is Destroying the Planet|last=Schlossberg|first=Tatiana|date=2019-09-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> They emphasize optimizing certain aspects of the [[supply chain]] for the trends to be designed and manufactured quickly and inexpensively and allow the [[mainstream]] [[consumer]] to buy current clothing styles at a lower price.

In recent Spring/Summer [[Fashion show|Fashion Show]] 2020, high end designers are leading the movement of slow fashion by  creating pieces that develop environmental friendly practices in the industry.<ref>https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/slow-fashion-trend</ref> [[British Vogue]] explains that the process of designing and creating clothing in slow fashion involves consciousness of materials, consumers demand, and the climate impact.<ref>https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/slow-fashion-trend</ref>\n\n== Strategy ==\n\n=== Management===\nThe primary objective of fast fashion is to quickly produce a product in a [[cost-efficient]] manner to respond to fast-changing [[consumer taste]]s in as near real time as possible. This efficiency is achieved through the retailers\u2019 understanding of the [[target market]]'s wants, which is a high fashion-looking garment at a price at the lower end of the [[clothing sector]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>  Primarily, the concept of [[category management]] has been used to align the retail buyer and the manufacturer in a more collaborative relationship.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sheridan | first1 = Mandy | last2 = Moore | first2 = Christopher | last3 = Nobbs | first3 = Karinna | year = 2006 | title = Fast fashion requires fast marketing: The role of category management in fast fashion positioning | url = | journal = Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 301\u201315 | doi=10.1108/13612020610679286}}</ref>  This collaboration occurs as many companies\u2019 resources are pooled to further develop more sophisticated and efficient supply chain models to increase the market's total profit. The fast fashion market utilizes this by uniting with foreign manufacturers to keep prices at a minimum.\n\n===Quick response method===\n[[Quick Response]] (QR) was developed to improve manufacturing processes in the textile industry with the aim of removing time from the production system.<ref>Hines, T.

(2004), Supply Chain Strategies: Customer Driven and Customer Focused, Oxford: Elsevier</ref>\n\nThe concept of quick response (QR) is now used to support \"fast fashion\", creating new, fresh products while also drawing consumers back to the retail experience for consecutive visits.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bruce | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Daly | first2 = Lucy | year = 2006 | title = Buyer behaviour for fast fashion | url = | journal = Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u201344 | doi=10.1108/13612020610679303}}</ref>  Quick response also makes it possible for new technologies to increase production and efficiency, typified by the introduction of the complementary concept of [[Fast Fit]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The Spanish mega chain [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], owned by [[Inditex]], has become the global model for how to decrease the time between design and production. This production short cut enables Zara to manufacture over 30,000 units of product every year to nearly 1,600 stores in 58 countries.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Pfeifer, Margarida O. \"Fast and Furious.\" Latin Trade (English) 15.9 (Sep. 2007): 14-14. Business Source Complete.</ref>  New items are delivered twice a week to the stores, reducing the time between initial sale and replenishment. As a result, the shortened time period improves consumer's garment choices and product availability while significantly increasing the number of per customer visits per annum. In the case of [[Renner (company)|Renner]], a Brazilian chain, a new mini-collection is released every two months.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[Marketing]] is the key driver of fast fashion. Marketing creates the desire for consumption of new designs as close as possible to the point of creation. Marketing closes the gap between creation and consumption by promoting this as something fast, low priced, and disposable.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/47608/|title = The life-cycle of the fashion garment and the role of Australian mass market designers|last = Payne|first = Alice|date = 2011|journal = The International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability|volume = 7|pages = 237\u2013246|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref> The continuous release of new products essentially makes the garments a highly cost effective marketing tool that drives consumer visits, increases brand awareness, and results in higher rates of consumer purchases. Fast fashion companies have also enjoyed higher profit margins in that their markdown percentage is only 15% compared to competitors\u2019 30% plus. The fast fashion business model is based on reducing the time cycles from production to consumption such that consumers engage in more cycles in any time period. For example, the traditional fashion seasons followed the annual cycle of summer, autumn, winter and spring, but in fast fashion cycles have compressed into shorter periods of 4\u20136 weeks and in some cases less than this. Marketers have thus created more buying seasons in the same time-space.<ref>Hines, Tony. 2001. \"Globalization: An introduction to fashion markets and fashion marketing.\" In Fashion marketing: Contemporary issues. Eds. T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 1-24.</ref>  Two approaches are currently being used by companies as market strategies; the difference is the amount of financial capital spent on advertisements. While some companies invest in advertising, fast fashion mega firm [[Primark]] operates with no advertising. Primark instead invests in store layout, shopfit and [[visual merchandising]] to create an instant hook.<ref>Baker, Rosie. \"Following fast fashion.\" In-Store (June 2008): 37-39. Business Source Complete. [[EBSCO]].</ref>  The instant hook creates an enjoyable shopping experience, resulting in the continuous return of customers. Research shows that seventy five percent of consumer's decisions are made in front of the fixture within three seconds.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  The alternative spending of Primark also \"allows the retailer to pass the benefits of a cost saving back to the consumer and maintain the company's price structure of producing garments at a lower cost\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===\"Supermarket\" market===\nThe consumer in the fast fashion market thrives on constant change and the frequent availability of new products.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Fast fashion is considered to be a \"[[supermarket]]\" segment within the larger sense of the fashion market.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  This term refers to fast fashion's nature to \"race to make apparel an even smarter and quicker cash generator\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Three crucial differentiating model factors exist within fast fashion consumption: [[market timing]], cost, and the buying cycle.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Timing's objective is to create the shortest production time possible. The quick turnover has increased the demand for the number of seasons presented in the stores. This demand also increases shipping and restocking time periods.\nCost is still the consumer's primary [[buying decision]]. Costs are largely reduced by taking advantage of lower prices in markets in developing countries. In 2004 developing countries accounted for nearly seventy five percent of all clothing exports and the removal of several [[import quota]]s has allowed companies to take advantage of the even lower cost of resources.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\nThe buying cycle is the final factor that affects the consumer. Traditionally, fashion buying cycles are based around long term forecasts that occur one year to six months before the season.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Yet, in the fast fashion market the quick response philosophy can result in higher forecast accuracy because the time period is significantly shortened. A higher sell-through for the goods produced is also a result of the shortened production period.\n\n===Supply chain, vendor relationships and internal relationships===\n\n====Supply chain====\nSupply chains are central to the creation of fast fashion. Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hines | first1 = T | year = 2010 | title = Trends in textile global supply chains | url = | journal = Textiles | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201320 }}</ref> Efficient [[supply chains]] are critical to delivering the retail customer promise of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>  Two kinds of supply chains exist, [[agile enterprise|agile]] and [[lean manufacturing|lean]]. In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A lean supply chain is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The combination of the two supply chains is called ''\"[[leagile]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n====Vendor relationships====\nThe companies in the fast fashion market also utilize a range of relationships with the suppliers. The product is first classified as \"core\" or \"fashion\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Suppliers close to the market are used for products that are produced in the middle of a season, meaning trendy, \"fashion\" items. In comparison, long-distance suppliers are utilized for cheap, \"core\" items, sometimes referred to as \"capsule\" clothing, that are used in collections every season and have a stable forecast.\n\n====Internal relationships====\nProductive internal relationships within the fast fashion companies are as important as the company's relationships with external suppliers, especially when it comes to the company's buyers. Traditionally with a \"supermarket\" market the buying is divided into multi-functional departments. The buying team uses the bottom-up approach when trend information is involved, meaning the information is only shared with the company's fifteen top suppliers.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  On the other hand, information about future aims, and strategies of production are shared downward within the buyer [[hierarchy]] so the team can consider lower cost production options.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The buyers also interact closely with [[merchandising]] and design departments of the company because of the buyer's focus on style and color. The buyer must also consult with the overall design team to understand the cohesion between trend forecasting and consumer's wants. The close relationships result in flexibility within the company and an accelerated response speed to the demands of the market.\n\n====Sustainable labor costing and efficiency dilemma in fast fashion====\n\nPublished by University of Manchester, the Working Papers of \"Capturing the Gains, global summit\" brings together an international network of experts from North and South. The Working Paper 14 focuses on a specific feature of buying behavior in the UK fashion retail industry: the negotiation of a manufacturing price (cut-make-trim, CMT, cost) with suppliers that does not separately itemize [[labour cost]]. This practice, tacitly supported by both buyers and suppliers, is examined against the backdrop of ongoing [[wage defaulting]] and import price [[deflation]] in the global apparel industry. For obvious reasons, the make-up of standard time using  [[Predetermined Time standard]]s (PTS), [[Predetermined motion time system]] (PMTS); is highly technical and \u2018synthetic\u2019. According to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems, offered by consultancies for adoption by manufacturing companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Work Study|year=1992|author=George Kanawaty|isbn= 978-9221071082|publisher=International Labour Office|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lHHB-3qayLUC}}</ref> In apparel manufacture, three PTS (aka PMTS) consultancy firms specializing in [[methods-time measurement]] (MTM) appear to be operating in the sector\u2013 the US-based Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards ([[MODAPTS]]), the Sri Lankan-based Seweasy and the UK-headquartered GSD (Corporate) Ltd.

Textile Technology Index. EBSCO.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn order to understand the Fast Fashion industry and how it became a global phenomenon, it\u2019s essential to first look at the context of its history and origins. Before the 1800s, fashion was an extensive and almost primitive process where one had to source materials like wool or leather, prepare and weave them into garments. However, the Industrial Revolution revolutionized the world of fashion by introducing new technology \u2013 like the sewing machine, textile machines, ready-made clothing factories and mass production of clothes. All of this resulted in clothes becoming cheaper, easier and quicker to make. Meanwhile, localized dressmaking businesses started to emerge to cater to the middle classes, and they employed workroom employees along with garment workers, who worked from home for meagre wages. These types of operations would, later on, lead to the growth of the \u2018sweatshops\u2019 that would provide the basis of modern clothing production <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goodonyou.eco/what-is-fast-fashion/|title=What Is Fast Fashion?|date=2018-08-07|website=Good On You|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. During World War II, the trend of more functional styles and fabric restrictions led to the standardized production of clothes. Once the middle-class consumers got accustomed to it, they became more receptive to the idea of mass-produced clothing.\n\nThe fashion industry produced and ran clothes for four seasons a year: fall, winter, spring and summer up until the mid-twentieth century, and the designers would work many months in advance to predict and strategize what the customers would want. It was in the 1960s and 1970s that this method changed drastically when the young generation started to create new trends and used cheaply-made clothing as a form of personal expression. Although most fashion brands tried to find ways of keeping up with the increasing demand for affordable clothes, there was still a clear distinction between the high-end and high street fashion. It was only in the late 1990s and 2000s that the notion of low-cost fashion reached its peak when fast fashion retailers like [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], [[H&M]], [[Topshop]] and [[Primark]] took over high street fashion. Initially starting as small stores located in Europe, they were able to infiltrate and gain prominence in the American market by examining and replicating the looks and design elements from runway shows and top fashion houses and quickly reproducing and selling them at a fraction of a cost<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion|title=Fashion History Lesson: The Origins of Fast Fashion|last=Idacavage|first=Sara|website=Fashionista|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>.\n\n=== Big Players of the Fast Fashion movement ===\nWhen it comes to question of who was the pioneer of the Fast Fashion phenomenon, it is difficult to pinpoint one particular brand or company. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that suggest the popular fashion brands that helped start the phenomenon. [[Amancio Ortega]], founder of [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], founded his clothing company in 1963 in a place called [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and it featured products that were affordable replications of popular higher-end clothing fashions in addition to producing its own unique designs. Later on in 1975 Ortega opened the first retail outlet in Europe in order to sell his collections in the short run and also to integrate production and distribution in the long run. He eventually was able to move to New York in the early 1990s where the ''New York Times'' first coined the term \u201cfast fashion\u201d to describe the mission of his store which said that \u201cit would only take 15 days for a garment to go from a designer's brain to being sold on the racks\u201d<ref name=\":4\" />. In the article ''\u201cFast Fashion Lessons\u201d''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sull|first=Donald|last2=Turconi|first2=Stefano|date=2008|title=Fast fashion lessons|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8616.2008.00527.x|journal=Business Strategy Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=4\u201311|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8616.2008.00527.x|issn=1467-8616}}</ref> Donald Sull and Stefano Turconi studies how Zara pioneered an approach to navigate the volatile world of the fast fashion industry. According to Sull and Turconi one of the reasons for Zara\u2019s success was that it built a [[supply chain]] and production network where they maintained complicated and capital-intensive operations (like computer-guided fabric cutting) in-house, while it outsourced labor intensive operations (like garment sewing) to a network of local subcontractors and seamstress operatives based in Galicia. Thus with shorter [[Lead time|lead times]] the company was able to respond very quickly when the sale of their products exceeded their expectations and also cut off production for items that didn\u2019t have very high demands. Unlike many fashion companies, Zara hardly invests in television or press promotional campaigns and instead relies on store windows to convey the brand image, spread of word-of-mouth and locating their shops strategically in areas with high consumer traffic.\n\nSimilar to Zara, the origin story of H&M also has common traits and technically it has also been the longest running retailer. In 1946 [[Erling Persson]], a Swedish entrepreneur, goes on a trip to the USA where he was greatly intrigued and impressed by the concept of efficient and high-volume production stores that he witnessed in New York. The following year in 1947 Persson establishes a women\u2019s wear store called Hennes (which is Swedish for \u201cHers\u201d) & Mauritz (also commonly known as [[H&M]]) in [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Sweden and then between the years of 1960 and 1979 the company rapidly expands not only in terms of location, with 42 stores across Europe, but also in terms of its clothing to include the whole family. The initial foundation for its global expansion is laid when in the 1980s H&M decides to acquire Rowells, a Swedish mail order company, and use it to shift the sale of their fashion products directly into the customer\u2019s homes. After that in the 1990s H&M decides to invest and capitalize on the transition to large city billboard advertising for their products by using famous celebrities and supermodels wearing their clothes. Finally H&M opens its first flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York in 2000, which marked the commencement of its international expansion outside of Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hmgroup.com/about-us/history.html|title=H&M group {{!}} History|website=hmgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Zaw Thiha Tun examines the secret of H&M\u2019s success as a company and mentions that the distinct business model of H&M is unlike Zara since they don\u2019t manufacture any of their products in-house. Rather it outsources its production to more than 900 independent suppliers that are mainly located in Europe and Asia and overseen by 30 strategically located oversight offices. At the same time it primarily depends on its state-of-the-art IT infrastructure and network to connect between the central national office and the production offices. This fact proves to be very crucial to their operations since they don\u2019t own factories or secure the fabrics in advance, and thus they have been able to reduce their lead times through continuous developments in the buying process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/041216/hm-secret-its-success.asp|title=H&M: The Secret to Its Success|last=Tun|first=Zaw Thiha|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\n[[File:H&MdowntownMontreal.jpg|thumb|right|A H&M store in Downtown [[Montreal]]]]\nFast fashion brands produce pieces to get the newest style on the market as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html|title=How Fast Fashion Is Destroying the Planet|last=Schlossberg|first=Tatiana|date=2019-09-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> They emphasize optimizing certain aspects of the [[supply chain]] for the trends to be designed and manufactured quickly and inexpensively and allow the [[mainstream]] [[consumer]] to buy current clothing styles at a lower price.

This efficiency is achieved through the retailers\u2019 understanding of the [[target market]]'s wants, which is a high fashion-looking garment at a price at the lower end of the [[clothing sector]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>  Primarily, the concept of [[category management]] has been used to align the retail buyer and the manufacturer in a more collaborative relationship.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sheridan | first1 = Mandy | last2 = Moore | first2 = Christopher | last3 = Nobbs | first3 = Karinna | year = 2006 | title = Fast fashion requires fast marketing: The role of category management in fast fashion positioning | url = | journal = Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 301\u201315 | doi=10.1108/13612020610679286}}</ref>  This collaboration occurs as many companies\u2019 resources are pooled to further develop more sophisticated and efficient supply chain models to increase the market's total profit. The fast fashion market utilizes this by uniting with foreign manufacturers to keep prices at a minimum.\n\n===Quick response method===\n[[Quick Response]] (QR) was developed to improve manufacturing processes in the textile industry with the aim of removing time from the production system.<ref>Hines, T. (2007) Supply Chain Strategies, Structures and Relationships, in Hines, T. and M.Bruce. Eds. Fashion Marketing Contemporary Issues 2nd Edn.

Eds. T. Hines and M. Bruce.

(2004), Supply Chain Strategies: Customer Driven and Customer Focused, Oxford: Elsevier</ref>\n\nThe concept of quick response (QR) is now used to support \"fast fashion\", creating new, fresh products while also drawing consumers back to the retail experience for consecutive visits.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bruce | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Daly | first2 = Lucy | year = 2006 | title = Buyer behaviour for fast fashion | url = | journal = Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u201344 | doi=10.1108/13612020610679303}}</ref>  Quick response also makes it possible for new technologies to increase production and efficiency, typified by the introduction of the complementary concept of [[Fast Fit]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The Spanish mega chain [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], owned by [[Inditex]], has become the global model for how to decrease the time between design and production. This production short cut enables Zara to manufacture over 30,000 units of product every year to nearly 1,600 stores in 58 countries.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Pfeifer, Margarida O. \"Fast and Furious.\" Latin Trade (English) 15.9 (Sep. 2007): 14-14. Business Source Complete.</ref>  New items are delivered twice a week to the stores, reducing the time between initial sale and replenishment. As a result, the shortened time period improves consumer's garment choices and product availability while significantly increasing the number of per customer visits per annum. In the case of [[Renner (company)|Renner]], a Brazilian chain, a new mini-collection is released every two months.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[Marketing]] is the key driver of fast fashion. Marketing creates the desire for consumption of new designs as close as possible to the point of creation. Marketing closes the gap between creation and consumption by promoting this as something fast, low priced, and disposable.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/47608/|title = The life-cycle of the fashion garment and the role of Australian mass market designers|last = Payne|first = Alice|date = 2011|journal = The International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability|volume = 7|pages = 237\u2013246|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref> The continuous release of new products essentially makes the garments a highly cost effective marketing tool that drives consumer visits, increases brand awareness, and results in higher rates of consumer purchases. Fast fashion companies have also enjoyed higher profit margins in that their markdown percentage is only 15% compared to competitors\u2019 30% plus. The fast fashion business model is based on reducing the time cycles from production to consumption such that consumers engage in more cycles in any time period. For example, the traditional fashion seasons followed the annual cycle of summer, autumn, winter and spring, but in fast fashion cycles have compressed into shorter periods of 4\u20136 weeks and in some cases less than this. Marketers have thus created more buying seasons in the same time-space.<ref>Hines, Tony. 2001. \"Globalization: An introduction to fashion markets and fashion marketing.\" In Fashion marketing: Contemporary issues. Eds. T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 1-24.</ref>  Two approaches are currently being used by companies as market strategies; the difference is the amount of financial capital spent on advertisements. While some companies invest in advertising, fast fashion mega firm [[Primark]] operates with no advertising. Primark instead invests in store layout, shopfit and [[visual merchandising]] to create an instant hook.<ref>Baker, Rosie. \"Following fast fashion.\" In-Store (June 2008): 37-39. Business Source Complete. [[EBSCO]].</ref>  The instant hook creates an enjoyable shopping experience, resulting in the continuous return of customers. Research shows that seventy five percent of consumer's decisions are made in front of the fixture within three seconds.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  The alternative spending of Primark also \"allows the retailer to pass the benefits of a cost saving back to the consumer and maintain the company's price structure of producing garments at a lower cost\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===\"Supermarket\" market===\nThe consumer in the fast fashion market thrives on constant change and the frequent availability of new products.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Fast fashion is considered to be a \"[[supermarket]]\" segment within the larger sense of the fashion market.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  This term refers to fast fashion's nature to \"race to make apparel an even smarter and quicker cash generator\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Three crucial differentiating model factors exist within fast fashion consumption: [[market timing]], cost, and the buying cycle.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Timing's objective is to create the shortest production time possible. The quick turnover has increased the demand for the number of seasons presented in the stores. This demand also increases shipping and restocking time periods.\nCost is still the consumer's primary [[buying decision]]. Costs are largely reduced by taking advantage of lower prices in markets in developing countries. In 2004 developing countries accounted for nearly seventy five percent of all clothing exports and the removal of several [[import quota]]s has allowed companies to take advantage of the even lower cost of resources.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\nThe buying cycle is the final factor that affects the consumer. Traditionally, fashion buying cycles are based around long term forecasts that occur one year to six months before the season.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Yet, in the fast fashion market the quick response philosophy can result in higher forecast accuracy because the time period is significantly shortened. A higher sell-through for the goods produced is also a result of the shortened production period.\n\n===Supply chain, vendor relationships and internal relationships===\n\n====Supply chain====\nSupply chains are central to the creation of fast fashion. Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hines | first1 = T | year = 2010 | title = Trends in textile global supply chains | url = | journal = Textiles | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201320 }}</ref> Efficient [[supply chains]] are critical to delivering the retail customer promise of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>  Two kinds of supply chains exist, [[agile enterprise|agile]] and [[lean manufacturing|lean]]. In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A lean supply chain is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The combination of the two supply chains is called ''\"[[leagile]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n====Vendor relationships====\nThe companies in the fast fashion market also utilize a range of relationships with the suppliers. The product is first classified as \"core\" or \"fashion\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Suppliers close to the market are used for products that are produced in the middle of a season, meaning trendy, \"fashion\" items. In comparison, long-distance suppliers are utilized for cheap, \"core\" items, sometimes referred to as \"capsule\" clothing, that are used in collections every season and have a stable forecast.\n\n====Internal relationships====\nProductive internal relationships within the fast fashion companies are as important as the company's relationships with external suppliers, especially when it comes to the company's buyers. Traditionally with a \"supermarket\" market the buying is divided into multi-functional departments. The buying team uses the bottom-up approach when trend information is involved, meaning the information is only shared with the company's fifteen top suppliers.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  On the other hand, information about future aims, and strategies of production are shared downward within the buyer [[hierarchy]] so the team can consider lower cost production options.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The buyers also interact closely with [[merchandising]] and design departments of the company because of the buyer's focus on style and color. The buyer must also consult with the overall design team to understand the cohesion between trend forecasting and consumer's wants. The close relationships result in flexibility within the company and an accelerated response speed to the demands of the market.\n\n====Sustainable labour costing and efficiency dilemma in fast fashion====\n\nPublished by University of Manchester, the Working Papers of \"Capturing the Gains, global summit\" brings together an international network of experts from North and South. The Working Paper 14 focuses on a specific feature of buying behaviour in the UK fashion retail industry: the negotiation of a manufacturing price (cut-make-trim, CMT, cost) with suppliers that does not separately itemize [[labour cost]]. This practice, tacitly supported by both buyers and suppliers, is examined against the backdrop of ongoing [[wage defaulting]] and import price [[deflation]] in the global apparel industry. For obvious reasons, the make-up of standard time using  [[Predetermined Time standard]]s (PTS), [[Predetermined motion time system]] (PMTS); is highly technical and \u2018synthetic\u2019. According to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems, offered by consultancies for adoption by manufacturing companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Work Study|year=1992|author=George Kanawaty|isbn= 978-9221071082|publisher=International Labour Office|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lHHB-3qayLUC}}</ref> In apparel manufacture, three PTS (aka PMTS) consultancy firms specializing in [[methods-time measurement]] (MTM) appear to be operating in the sector\u2013 the US-based Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards ([[MODAPTS]]), the Sri Lankan-based Seweasy and the UK-headquartered GSD (Corporate) Ltd. All three forms of work measurement for arriving at a standard time should normally make provision for relaxation, contingency and special allowances.\n\n==List of fast fashion brands==\n{{original research section|date=September 2019}}\n*[[ASOS.com]]<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/as-waste-plagues-the-fast-fashion-industry-asos-is-taking-a-step-toward-sustainability/</ref>\n*[[Bershka]]\n*[[Bestseller (company)|Bestseller]]\n*[[Boohoo.com]]\n*[[C&A]]\n*[[Charlotte Russe (clothing retailer)|Charlotte Russe]]\n*[[Cotton On]]\n*[[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]]\n*[[Fashion Nova]]\n*[[FIVE FOXes]]\n*[[Forever 21]]\n*[[Gap Inc.]]\n*[[Giordano (store)|Giordano]]\n*[[Guess (clothing)|Guess?]]\n*[[H&M]]\n*[[Inditex]]\n*[[Mango (clothing)]]\n*[[Massimo Dutti]]\n*[[Metersbonwe]]\n*[[Missguided]]\n*[[Miss Selfridge]]\n*[[Nasty Gal]]\n*[[New Look (company)|New Look]]\n*[[NewYorker]]\n*[[Next plc|Next]]\n*[[Oysho]]\n*[[Peacocks (clothing)|Peacocks]]\n*[[PrettyLittleThing]]\n*[[Primark]]\n*[[Pull & Bear]]\n*[[Rainbow Shops]]\n*[[Lojas Renner|Renner]]\n*[[Lojas Riachuelo|Riachuelo]]\n*[[River Island]]\n*[[s.

International]] cricket match between the [[England women's cricket team]] and the [[New Zealand women's national cricket team]], played on 22 March 2009 at the [[North Sydney Oval]] in Australia. It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

The [[ink]] is often in [[Colour|color]] and chosen so that its intensity can vary greatly, creating dynamism and movement in the letter forms.

'''21''': 119\u2013148.</ref> Although the academic tradition of Islamic calligraphy began in Baghdad, the center of the Islamic empire during much of its early history, it eventually spread as far as India and Spain.\n\nCoins were another support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing Byzantine Christian imagery with Islamic phrases inscribed in Arabic. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur'an.\n\nBy the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were textiles featuring Arabic text that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the [[Suaire de Saint-Josse]], used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the Abbey of St. Josse-sur-Mer, near Caen in northwestern France.<ref name=Bloom />{{rp|223\u20135}}\n\nAs Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated, most works follow examples set by well-established calligraphers, with the exception of secular or contemporary works.

From the 14th century onward, other cursive styles began to develop in Turkey, Persia, and China.<ref name=\"LOCFragments\" />\n\n#[[Maghrebi script|'''Maghrebi''']] scripts developed from [[Kufic]] letters in the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa) and [[al-Andalus]] ([[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]), Maghrebi scripts are traditionally written with a pointed tip (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0630\u0628\u0628), producing a line of even thickness. Within the Maghrebi family, there are different styles including the cursive ''mujawher'' and the ceremonial ''mabsut.''\n##[[Maghrebi script#West African Maghrebi scripts|'''Sudani''']] scripts developed in [[Sudan (region)|''Biled as-Sudan'']] (the [[West Africa|West African]] [[Sahel]]) and can be considered a subcategory of [[Maghrebi script|Maghrebi scripts]]\n#'''[[Diwani]]''' is a cursive style of Arabic calligraphy developed during the reign of the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by [[Housam Roumi]], and reached its height of popularity under [[S\u00fcleyman I the Magnificent]] (1520\u20131566).<ref>{{cite web|title=Diwani script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166798/diwani-script|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Spaces between letters are often narrow, and lines ascend upwards from right to left. Larger variations called ''djali'' are filled with dense decorations of dots and diacritical marks in the space between, giving it a compact appearance. Diwani is difficult to read and write due to its heavy stylization and became the ideal script for writing court documents as it ensured confidentiality and prevented forgery.<ref name=\"qalam\" />\n# '''[[Nasta'liq]]''' is a [[cursive]] style originally devised to write the [[Persian language]] for literary and non-Qur'anic works.<ref name=qalam>{{cite web| title= An Introduction of Arabic, Ottoman, and Persian Calligraphy: Style|author=Kvernen, Elizabeth |year=2009|publisher=Calligraphy Qalam |url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/index.html}}</ref>  Nasta'liq is thought to be a later development of the naskh and the earlier ta'liq script used in Iran.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ta'liq Script |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581497/taliq-script|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Quite rapidly gaining popularity as a script in South Asia. The name ''ta'liq'' means \"hanging,\" and refers to the slightly sloped quality of lines of text in this script. Letters have short vertical strokes with broad and sweeping horizontal strokes. The shapes are deep, hook-like, and have high contrast.<ref name=qalam/> A variant called ''[[Shikasta Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq|Shikasteh]]'' was developed in the 17th century for more formal contexts.\n# '''[[Sini (script)|Sini]]''' is a style developed in China.

Calligrams are related to Muslim mysticism and popular with many leading calligraphers in [[Turkey]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[India]] from the 17th century onward.  Although striking in appearance, calligrams have never been regarded as appropriate or a decent expression of the art by the master calligraphers. Many calligrams therefore were produced by either folk calligraphers or for the interest of uncultivated people. These calligrams were not exhibited in mosques or Sufi convents in the Ottoman state, for example.  An element in this perspective is the rejection of the interpretation by the heretic Hurufiyyah Sufi order which sees letters as true manifestations of the fate, events and creation in themselves.  In the teachings of calligraphy, figurative imagery is used to help visualize the shape of letters to trace, for example, the letter ''ha' '' looks in ''nasta'liq'' similar to two eyes, as its Persian name implies: \"he' two eyes\" ''he' do cheshm''). In literature and poetry seeing in letters a reflection of the natural world goes back to the [[Abbasid]] times.  One of the contemporary masters of the calligram genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [[Wissam Shawkat]].  Good commercial examples are the logos of [[Al Jazeera]], an international news station based at [[Qatar]], and the [[Edinburgh Middle East Report]], a Scottish academic journal on the [[Middle East]], and also the work of the calligrapher and designer Wissam Shawkat.-->'''\n\n===Modern ===\nIn the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the ''[[Hurufiyya movement]]''.<ref name=\":0\">Flood, Necipo\u011flu (2017).

Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing Byzantine Christian imagery with Islamic phrases inscribed in Arabic. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur'an.\n\nBy the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were textiles featuring Arabic text that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions.

Calligrams are related to Muslim mysticism and popular with many leading calligraphers in [[Turkey]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[India]] from the 17th century onward.  Although striking in appearance, calligrams have never been regarded as appropriate or a decent expression of the art by the master calligraphers. Many calligrams therefore were produced by either folk calligraphers or for the interest of uncultivated people. These calligrams were not exhibited in mosques or Sufi convents in the Ottoman state, for example.  An element in this perspective is the rejection of the interpretation by the heretic Hurufiyyah Sufi order which sees letters as true manifestations of the fate, events and creation in themselves.  In the teachings of calligraphy, figurative imagery is used to help visualize the shape of letters to trace, for example, the letter ''ha' '' looks in ''nasta'liq'' similar to two eyes, as its Persian name implies: \"he' two eyes\" ''he' do cheshm''). In literature and poetry seeing in letters a reflection of the natural world goes back to the [[Abbasid]] times.  One of the contemporary masters of the calligram genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [[Wissam Shawkat]].  Good commercial examples are the logos of [[Al Jazeera]], an international news station based at [[Qatar]], and the [[Edinburgh Middle East Report]], a Scottish academic journal on the [[Middle East]], and also the work of the calligrapher and designer Wissam Shawkat.-->'''\n\n===Modern ===\nIn the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the ''[[Hurufiyya movement]]''.<ref name=\":0\">Flood, Necipo\u011flu (2017).

It was first settled in the 1850s by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and Irish immigrants. From the mid-1950s to about 1982 mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2016 Census was 3,881.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/living/about-bancroft|title=Bancroft, Ontario - About Bancroft|author=|date=|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]].<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftontario.com/history-bancroft-area/bancroft-history/ |title=The History of Bancroft, Ontario |website=bancroftontario.com |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade.  Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and  Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly; there were 89 families by 1868.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=bancroft%2C%20ontario&f=false| page=28-30 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario\u2019s Past (second edition)|last=Boyle|first=Terry |date=2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref> Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers were [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile.

They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904.

American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park.

A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.\n\n[[Algonquin Provincial Park]] about an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W provides camping and [[hiking]] opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery.

Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.\n\nOne of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.\n\n== Arts ==\nIn 2004, Bancroft won [[TVOntario]]'s \"Most Talented Town in Ontario\" contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the \"Fall Studio Tour\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of Bancroft (AGB) is the area's only public not-for profit art gallery. Completely run by dedicated volunteers, the AGB mounts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual \"Juried Show\" and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario's finest artists.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Village Playhouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|title=The Village Playhouse - Best of the Arts in North Hastings|work=bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[Image:Old station Bancroft ON.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Old train station (in 2006)]]\n\nBancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]] and [[Ontario Highway 62|Highway 62]], with several other inroads allowing access to the city.\n\nBancroft is served by the [[Bancroft Airport|Jack Brown Airport]], a [[Transport Canada]] Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 m) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction.  Currently operated by the [[Bancroft Flying Club]], the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.\n\nThe [[Central Ontario Railway]] arrived in November 1900 connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the 'Y' road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The [[Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway]] connected Bancroft with [[Kinmount]], Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008. The Chamber, Mineral Museum, and Art Gallery relocated to other sites in the town. In 2011, the old station was moved onto a new foundation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tedfordhousemovers.com/Tedford_House_Movers/Photo_Albums/Pages/Bancroft_Train_Station.html|title=Bancroft Train station lift|work=tedfordhousemovers.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> it is now restored with an addition at the southern end of the building to house the Bancroft Gem and Mineral Club's museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdougallminerals.com/blog/tag/bancroft-railway-station/|title=Bancroft Railway Station \u00ab  McDougall Minerals|work=mcdougallminerals.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> and a [[caboose]], which is not currently in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moosefm.com/chmss/news/use-of-the-caboose/|title=Use of the Caboose - My Bancroft Now|work=moosefm.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Print===\n*Bancroft Times, an independently-owned weekly (5,000 copies, paid circulation) founded 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebancrofttimes.ca|title=Bancroft Times|work=thebancrofttimes.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Bancroft This Week]]\n*North Hastings Advertiser\n\n===Radio===\n\n* FM 97.7 - [[CHMS-FM]] (\"[[Vista Broadcast Group|Moose FM]]\"), [[Adult contemporary music|hot adult contemporary]]\n* FM 99.3 - [[CBLA-FM|CBLA-FM-5]], ''(formerly AM 600 [[List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada|CBLV]])'' [[CBC Radio One]];

It was first settled in the 1850s by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and Irish immigrants. From the mid-1950s to about 1982 mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2016 Census was 3,881.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/living/about-bancroft|title=Bancroft, Ontario - About Bancroft|author=|date=|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]].<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftontario.com/history-bancroft-area/bancroft-history/ |title=The History of Bancroft, Ontario |website=bancroftontario.com |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade.  Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and  Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly; there were 89 families by 1868.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=bancroft%2C%20ontario&f=false| page=28-30 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario\u2019s Past (second edition)|last=Boyle|first=Terry |date=2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref> Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers were [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile. Most of the settlers were attracted to the area by the offer of free {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcels that had been advertised in Great Britain.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\"/>\nSome of the residents also sold furs, obtained through [[Animal trapping|trapping]].\n\nThe settlement had various names over the first years, York Mills, York River and York Branch; when the post office opened in 1861 it was called York River.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Nila|title=Bancroft, a Bonanza of Memories|year=1979|publisher=Bancroft Centennial Committee|page=90|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=957965}}</ref> A grist mill opened in 1865, gold was discovered in 1866 and other minerals would be discovered later.

In 1903, the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] connected to the COR north of town at what is now Y Road, referring to the [[wye junction]] joining the two lines. They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905.

American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.\n\n[[Algonquin Provincial Park]] about an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W provides camping and [[hiking]] opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery. Portaging is quite common in this park. Algonquin offers many visitor attractions. Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.\n\nOne of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.\n\n== Arts ==\nIn 2004, Bancroft won [[TVOntario]]'s \"Most Talented Town in Ontario\" contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the \"Fall Studio Tour\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of Bancroft (AGB) is the area's only public not-for profit art gallery. Completely run by dedicated volunteers, the AGB mounts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual \"Juried Show\" and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario's finest artists.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Village Playhouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|title=The Village Playhouse - Best of the Arts in North Hastings|work=bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[Image:Old station Bancroft ON.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Old train station (in 2006)]]\n\nBancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]] and [[Ontario Highway 62|Highway 62]], with several other inroads allowing access to the city.\n\nBancroft is served by the [[Bancroft Airport|Jack Brown Airport]], a [[Transport Canada]] Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 m) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction.  Currently operated by the [[Bancroft Flying Club]], the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.\n\nThe [[Central Ontario Railway]] arrived in November 1900 connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the 'Y' road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The [[Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway]] connected Bancroft with [[Kinmount]], Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008. The Chamber, Mineral Museum, and Art Gallery relocated to other sites in the town. In 2011, the old station was moved onto a new foundation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tedfordhousemovers.com/Tedford_House_Movers/Photo_Albums/Pages/Bancroft_Train_Station.html|title=Bancroft Train station lift|work=tedfordhousemovers.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> it is now restored with an addition at the southern end of the building to house the Bancroft Gem and Mineral Club's museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdougallminerals.com/blog/tag/bancroft-railway-station/|title=Bancroft Railway Station \u00ab  McDougall Minerals|work=mcdougallminerals.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> and a [[caboose]], which is not currently in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moosefm.com/chmss/news/use-of-the-caboose/|title=Use of the Caboose - My Bancroft Now|work=moosefm.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Print===\n*Bancroft Times, an independently-owned weekly (5000 copies, paid circulation) founded 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebancrofttimes.ca|title=Bancroft Times|work=thebancrofttimes.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Bancroft This Week]]\n*North Hastings Advertiser\n\n===Radio===\n\n* FM 97.7 - [[CHMS-FM]] (\"[[Vista Broadcast Group|Moose FM]]\"), [[Adult contemporary music|hot adult contemporary]]\n* FM 99.3 - [[CBLA-FM|CBLA-FM-5]], ''(formerly AM 600 [[List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada|CBLV]])'' [[CBC Radio One]];

She usually signed her work ''Z. Serebriakova'' or in Cyrillic script and sometimes she spelled her last name ''Serebriakoff'' (Rusakova 2006). Her family called her by the nicknames ''Zika'' and ''Zina'' (Serebriakova 1987).</ref> was a Russian (later French) painter.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Serebriakova portrait-of-e-solntseva-sister-of-artist-1914.jpg|thumb|left|''The Artist's Sister'', 1911]]\nZinaida Serebriakova was born on the estate of Neskuchnoye near Kharkov (now [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine) into one of the most refined and artistic families  in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nShe belonged to the artistic [[Benois family]]. Her grandfather, [[Nicholas Benois]], was a famous architect, chairman of the Society of Architects and member of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. Her uncle, [[Alexandre Benois]], was a famous painter, founder of the ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' art group. Her father, {{illm|Yevgeny Lanceray|WD=Q546558|lt=Yevgeny Nikolayevich Lanceray}}, was a well-known sculptor, and her mother, who was Alexandre Benois' sister, had a talent for drawing. One of Zinaida's brothers, [[Nikolay Lanceray]], was a talented architect, and her other brother, [[Yevgeny Yevgenyevich Lanceray]], had an important place in Russian and Soviet art as a master of monumental painting and [[graphic art]]. The Russian-English actor and writer [[Peter Ustinov]] was also related to her.\n\n==Youth==\n\nIn 1900 she graduated from a women's [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (equivalent to grammar school or high school), and entered the art school founded by [[Princess Maria Tenisheva]]. She studied under [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin|Repin]] in 1901, and under [[portrait]] artist [[Osip Braz]] between 1903 and 1905. In 1902\u20131903 she spent time in Italy, and from 1905 to 1906 she studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1905, she married her first cousin, Boris Serebriakov, the son of Evgenyi's sister, and took his surname. Boris went on to become a railroad engineer.\n\n==Happy years==\n[[Image:Serebryakova Harvest 1915.jpg|250px|thumb|''Harvest'', 1915]]\nFrom her youth onwards, Zinaida Serebriakova strove to express her love of the world and to show its beauty. Her earliest works, ''Country Girl'' (1906, [[Russian Museum]]) and ''Orchard in Bloom'' (1908, private collection), speak eloquently of this search, and of her acute awareness of the beauty of the Russian land and its people. These works are \u00e9tudes done from nature, and though she was young at the time, her extraordinary talent, confidence and boldness were apparent.\n\nBroad public recognition came with Serebriakova's self-portrait [[At the Dressing-Table]] (1909, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]), first shown at a large exhibition mounted by the [[Mir iskusstva|Union of Russian Artists]] in 1910.  The self-portrait was followed by ''Girl Bathing'' (1911, Russian Museum), a portrait of ''Ye.K.&nbsp;Lanceray'' (1911, private collection), and a portrait of the artist's mother ''Yekaterina Lanceray'' (1912, Russian Museum), already mature works, strict in composition.\n\nShe joined the ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' movement in 1911, but stood out from the other members of the group because of her preference for popular themes and because of the harmony, plasticity and generalized nature of her paintings.\n\nIn 1914&ndash;1917, Zinaida Serebriakova was in her prime. During these years she produced a series of pictures on the theme of Russian rural life, the work of the peasants and the Russian countryside which was so dear to her heart: ''Peasants'' (1914&ndash;1915, Russian Museum), ''Sleeping Peasant Girl'' (private collection).\n\nThe most important of these works was ''Bleaching Cloth'' (1917, Tretyakov Gallery), which revealed Zinaida Serebriakova's striking talent as a monumental artist. The figures of the peasant women, portrayed against the background of the sky, gain majesty and power by virtue of the low horizon.\n\nWhen in 1916 Alexander Benois was commissioned to decorate the [[Moscow Kazanskaya railway station|Kazan Railway Station]] in Moscow, he invited Yevgeny Lanceray, [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]], and Zinaida Serebriakova to help him. Serebriakova took on the theme of the [[Orient]]: [[India]], Japan, [[Turkey]], and [[Thailand|Siam]] are represented allegorically in the form of beautiful women. At the same time she began compositions on subjects from classical mythology, but these remained [[unfinished work|unfinished]].\n\n==Revolution==\n\n[[Image:Serebryakova CardHause.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''House of Cards'', 1919]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]] in 1917, Serebriakova was at her family estate of Neskuchnoye, and suddenly her whole life changed. In 1919 her husband Boris died of [[typhus]] contracted in [[Bolshevik]] jails. She was left without any income, responsible for her four children and her sick mother.  All the reserves of Neskuchnoye had been plundered, so the family suffered from hunger. She had to give up oil painting in favour of the less expensive techniques of charcoal and pencil. This was the time of her most tragic painting, [[:Image:Serebryakova CardHause.jpg|House of Cards]], which depicts her four orphaned children.\n\nShe did not want to switch to the [[Russian Futurism|futurist]] style popular in the art of the early Soviet period, nor paint portraits of [[commissar]]s, but she found some work at the [[Kharkov Archaeological Museum]], where she made pencil drawings of the exhibits. In December 1920 she moved to her grandfather\u2019s apartment in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]]. After the [[October Revolution]], inhabitants of private apartments were forced to share them with additional inhabitants, but Serebriakova was lucky - she was quartered with artists from the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. Thus, Serebriakova's work during this period focuses on theatre life. Also around this time, Serebriakova's daughter, Tatiana, entered the academy of ballet, and Serebriakova created a series of pastels on the [[Mariinsky Theater]].\n\n==Paris==\n\n[[File:Zinaida Serebryakova (1914) At Breakfast.jpg|thumb|''[[:ru:\u0417\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c|At Breakfast]]'', 1914]]\nIn the autumn of 1924, Serebriakova went to Paris, having received a commission for a large decorative mural. On finishing this work, she intended to return to the [[Soviet Union]], where her mother and the four children remained. However, she was not able to return, and although she was able to bring her younger children, Alexandre and Catherine, to Paris in 1926 and 1928 respectively, she could not do the same for her two older children, Evgenyi and Tatiana, and did not see them again for many years.\n\nAfter this, Zinaida Serebriakova traveled a great deal. In 1928 and 1930 she traveled to Africa, visiting [[Morocco]]. She was fascinated by the landscapes of northern Africa and painted the [[Atlas mountains]], as well as [[Arab]] women and [[Africans]] in ethnic clothing. She also painted a cycle devoted to [[Brittany|Breton]] fishermen. The salient feature of her later landscapes and portraits is the artist's own personality \u2014 her love of beauty, whether in nature or in people.\n\nIn 1947, Serebriakova at last took French citizenship, and it was not until [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khruschev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]] that the Soviet Government allowed her to resume contact with her family in the Soviet Union. In 1960, after 36&nbsp;years of forced separation, her older daughter, Tatiana (Tata), was finally allowed to visit her. At this time, Tatiana was also working as an artist, painting scenery for the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].\n\nZinaida Serebriakova's works were finally exhibited in the Soviet Union in 1966, in Moscow, [[Leningrad]], and [[Kiev]], to great acclaim. Her albums sold by the millions, and she was compared to [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]. However, although she sent about 200 of her works to be shown in the Soviet Union, the bulk of her work remains in France today.\n\nZinaida Serebriakova died in Paris on 19 September 1967, at the age of 82. She is buried in Paris, at [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery|the Russian cemetery]] at [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois]].\n\n==Selected artwork==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Serebriaikova veranda-spring.jpg|''The Veranda in Spring'', watercolor, 1900\nFile:Zinaida Serebriakova The Shoots of Autumn Crops.jpg|''The Shoots of Autumn Crops'', 1908\nFile:1910. \u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b \u041b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435.jpg|''Portrait of Olga Lanceray'', 1910\nFile:Serebriakova apples-on-the-branches-1910.jpg|''Apples on the Branches'', 1910\nFile:1911. \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430.jpg|''Nude'', 1911\nFile:Zinaida Serebryakova - self-portrait as Piero (1911).jpg|''Self-portrait as [[Pierrot]]'', 1911\nFile:Serebryakova Bath house 1913.jpg|''Bath-house'', 1913\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Orientalist artists]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n<!--\nThese templates can be copied for additional references.

In 1928 and 1930 she traveled to Africa, visiting [[Morocco]]. She was fascinated by the landscapes of northern Africa and painted the [[Atlas mountains]], as well as [[Arab]] women and [[Africans]] in ethnic clothing. She also painted a cycle devoted to [[Brittany|Breton]] fishermen. The salient feature of her later landscapes and portraits is the artist's own personality \u2014 her love of beauty, whether in nature or in people.\n\nIn 1947, Serebriakova at last took French citizenship, and it was not until [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khruschev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]] that the Soviet Government allowed her to resume contact with her family in the Soviet Union. In 1960, after 36&nbsp;years of forced separation, her older daughter, Tatiana (Tata), was finally allowed to visit her. At this time, Tatiana was also working as an artist, painting scenery for the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].\n\nZinaida Serebriakova's works were finally exhibited in the Soviet Union in 1966, in Moscow, [[Leningrad]], and [[Kiev]], to great acclaim. Her albums sold by the millions, and she was compared to [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]. However, although she sent about 200 of her works to be shown in the Soviet Union, the bulk of her work remains in France today.\n\nZinaida Serebriakova died in Paris on 19 September 1967, at the age of 82. She is buried in Paris, at [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery|the Russian cemetery]] at [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois]].\n\n==Selected artwork==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Serebriaikova veranda-spring.jpg|''The Veranda in Spring'', watercolor, 1900\nFile:Zinaida Serebriakova The Shoots of Autumn Crops.jpg|''The Shoots of Autumn Crops'', 1908\nFile:1910. \u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b \u041b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435.jpg|''Portrait of Olga Lanceray'', 1910\nFile:Serebriakova apples-on-the-branches-1910.jpg|''Apples on the Branches'', 1910\nFile:1911. \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430.jpg|''Nude'', 1911\nFile:Zinaida Serebryakova - self-portrait as Piero (1911).jpg|''Self-portrait as [[Pierrot]]'', 1911\nFile:Serebryakova Bath house 1913.jpg|''Bath-house'', 1913\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Orientalist artists]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n<!--\nThese templates can be copied for additional references.
