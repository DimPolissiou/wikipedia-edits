B Line and D Line were the breaker panels in which Powerline breakers were used. Eventually, the company branded Powerline and Powerlink panels and breakers.  Powerlink was a heavy duty 277-volt lighting breaker, used in large buildings with 277-volt lighting loads. These were also favored for their robust design, and functional reliability.

The panel uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a flat blade screwdriver contacting only de-energized parts of the backplane of the panel.

A '''modern convenience''' is a [[Manual labour|labor]]-saving device, service or substance which make a task easier or more [[efficiency|efficient]] than a traditional method. Convenience is a relative concept, and depends on context. For example, [[automobile]]s were once considered a convenience, yet today are regarded as a normal part of life.\n\nBecause differences in [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s around the world, the term is a relative term based upon the conveniences previously available to a person or group.  For instance, an American definition of 'modern convenience' is likely different from that of an individual living in a [[developing country]]. Most of the time, the term 'modern convenience' is used to express personal lifestyle and home life.\n\n==Examples==\n'''Service conveniences''' are those that save shoppers time or effort, and includes variables such as [[Credit (finance)|credit]] availability and extended store hours.<ref name=\"Leonard\"/> Service convenience pertains to the facilitation of selling both goods and services, and combinations of the two.<ref name=\"Leonard\"/>\n\n'''Convenience goods''' are widely distributed products that \"require minimal time and physical and mental effort to purchase.\"<ref name=\"Leonard\"/>\n\n[[Convenience food|Ready meals]] and [[convenience cooking]] spare the consumer effort in preparation of a [[meal]] while providing high levels of energy and pronounced, if mostly artificial, [[flavour]].\n\n[[Filling station]]s sell items that have nothing to do with refuelling a motor vehicle, (eg milk, newspapers, cigarettes) but purchasing at that location can save the consumer time compared to making a separate journey to a [[supermarket]]. Conveniences such as [[wikt:direct deposit|direct deposit]] can save companies and [[consumer]]s money, though this may or may not be passed along to the consumer.\n\nSome conveniences can become nuisances when they break down or don't function correctly. It costs [[time]] and [[money]] to fix items of convenience when they break down, and may cause much greater costs if something else that depends on them cannot take place.\n\n==History==\n===Late 19th century===\n'''Household'''\nIn 1911, architect and author Louis. H. Gibson defined modern conveniences as \"those arrangements and appliances which make it possible for people to live [[comfort]]ably in a larger house, without seriously increasing the cares which they had in a smaller one\". The supposition is that at that time if a family lived in a smaller home, they would have less furniture, appliances and other goods to take care of, and as a result the family's lifestyle and [[housekeeping]] would be relatively easy.  If, on the other hand, a family moved into a larger home the increase area and furnishings would be much more difficult to manage without labor-saving devices.<ref name=Gibson1889>Gibson, Louis H.

Shabbat is considered a festive day, when a Jew is freed from the regular labors of everyday life, can contemplate the spiritual aspects of life, and can spend time with family.\n\nOrthodox and some Conservative authorities rule that there are 39 [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|prohibited activities]] of work (referred to as \"''melakhot''\"), such as turning [[electricity|electric]] devices on or off, driving cars, and more, during the Shabbat, as listed in [[Mishnah]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Tractate Shabbat]].<ref>Neulander, Arthur.

The many labor-saving devices have kept pace with growing houses and furnishings and allow for greater [[leisure]]. There are also some negative effects, some of which are also as the result of advancements in [[chemical technology]] in the food that we eat or products that we use. In these cases there are also conflicting opinions about the extent to which some of the products are harmful. Here are a few examples of positive and negative effects of modern conveniences.\n\n===Positive effects===\n====Health care====\nSome of the major improvements over the past century has been in improved [[health care]]. For example, [[modern medicine]] has made leaps in preventing [[infectious diseases]] in part due to improved [[water treatment|water]] and [[sewage treatment]]. This is obvious in the marked rises in [[Life expectancy#Life expectancy variation over time|life expectancy]].<ref name=PureHealthMD>PureHealthMD editors.

Retrieved 9-18-2011.</ref>\n\n====Technological advancement in underdeveloped countries====\nSome of the most dramatic technological benefits are seen in underdeveloped countries. For instance, cabling for [[landline telephone]] service is expensive and requires a lot of time to complete, especially in the most remote areas. Introduction of [[cellphone]] service, on the other hand, is much cheaper and dramatically improves individual's ability to be economically productive, often in [[microbusiness]]es. It is estimated that 80% of the world's population is now located within range of cellular towers, 1.5 billion cellular phones are in use in developing countries and, in India alone, five million customers sign up for cellular service each week. The [[Four Asian Tigers]]\u2014i.e., [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[South Korea]]\u2014are a few of the countries that have leveraged technology to become a presence in the global community.<ref name=Kirkpatrick>Kirkpatrick, David.

As an example, the author compared having a calming cup of tea with a person to the more distant practice of placing a telephone call. Labor-saving devices meant that people now spent more time [[Sedentary lifestyle|sitting]], breathed machine-generated [[smoke]], and ate food, especially meat, fat and sugars, in greater abundance, changing peoples' diets. These activities were speculated to result in [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], and \"nervous strain\".<ref>George H. Simmons (ed.) (1905).

[[Red meat]] consumption has been linked to [[colon cancer]]; besides, [[growth hormone]] and [[antibiotics]] treatment of cattle and poultry has raised serious concerns about the adverse effects of those substances in industrially produced meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prevention.com/food/healthy-eating-tips/10-reasons-to-stop-eating-red-meat/slide/8|title=10 Reasons To Stop Eating Red Meat|date=30 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Processed food and food preparation====\n:[[Convenience food|Processed foods]], [[high-fructose corn syrup]], and increased fat\u2014the greater reliance on processed, packaged, microwaveable food has resulted in a rise in [[Type 2 diabetes]], [[obesity]], and other health concerns.{{medcn|date=November 2017}} [[Margarine]], once seen as a great alternative to butter, does not help with absorption of [[nutrient]]s and may contribute to [[heart disease]].{{medcn|date=November 2017}}\n\n====Other====\n:[[Styrofoam]] cups release [[styrene]] as the food or drink is consumed.

Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay? Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, \"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.\"Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power.

Its preservatives work primarily by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms through oxidation.<ref name=\":3\" /> Also, because different kinds of wine have different aromas, colors, and flavors, they should not use the same preservatives.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, the preservatives added to white wine are mainly ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and sorbic acid. <ref name=\":5\" />Ascorbic acid is used as an antioxidant, while sorbic acid is used to inhibit the growth of yeast in white wine.<ref name=\":3\" /> Sorbic acid cannot be used in red wine because it can cause pollution.Sulfites, or small molecules of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen disulfide (H2O2), are commonly used as preservatives in wine and even other fruit drinks. <ref name=\":4\" />Their principle is basically to make microbial protein coagulation or denaturation, thereby interfering with their growth and reproduction.<ref name=\":4\" />Sulfites are mainly in the form of sulfur dioxide at different PH concentrations<ref name=\":1\" />.
