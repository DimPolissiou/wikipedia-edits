[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts.

[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts.

The debt/GDP ratio is well above the 35% prescribed by law.<ref>Paul Flanagan, From economic boom to crisis management in PNG Available at: http://www.devpolicy.org/from-economic-boom-to-crisis-management-in-png-20160105/   Posted on: 5/01/2016 Accessed on 3/05/2018</ref> According to O\u2019Neill, this is a temporary setback caused by low prices for natural resources, and the economy is fundamentally stable and the government\u2019s policies are on track.<ref>Freddy Mou, PM O\u2019Neill confident about the economy Available at:\nhttp://www.looppng.com/business/pm-o\u2019neill-confident-economy-71803 Posted on: 3/01/2018 Accessed on: 3/05/2018\n</ref><ref>David James, PNG economy strong despite critics Available at: https://www.businessadvantagepng.com/pm-insists-papua-new-guinea-economy-strong-despite-critics/ Posted on 1/05/2018 Accessed on: 3/05/2018</ref>\n\nO'Neill's claims of economic stability are challenged by economists who see the economic problems as emerging from policies of the O\u2019Neill government.<ref name=\"auto\">Depressing start to 2018; 7 billion less than promised Available at: http://pngeconomics.org/2017/12/sombre-2018-k7-billion-less/ Posted on: 31/12/2017</ref> Thirdly, the government has lost large amounts of money in credit schemes to purchase equity in LNG/PNG and Oil Search.

Gun shots were fired and, shortly thereafter, the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135\u00b0 and purposely collided with ''RCGS Resolute''. The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship's head towards Venezuelan territorial waters.

After sitting in port for two days, it was revealed that the fuel could not be obtained because of non-payment by the ship operator, One Ocean Expeditions.  The Antarctic expedition was cancelled and the ship sailed back to Buenos Aires with all her passengers.  Once in Buenos Aires, the passengers disembarked and were left on their own with no reimbursement or compensation.  The ship was subsequently arrested in Buenos Aires for non-payment of debts. <ref>https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Rcgs-Resolute-9000168.html</ref> <ref>https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/dates-and-rates</ref>\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n=== 1996 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1997 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 2005 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 2013 drydock fire ===\n\nOn 13 June 2013, the ship was in [[drydock]] at the Bredo Shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany when a fire broke out in the shipyard.

After conquering all the small kingdoms of Nepal in the mid-eighteenth century, King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] moved his capital to Kathmandu from [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] and named the newly created empire, Nepal.\n\n==Establishment of expanded Gorkha kingdom==\nGorkha was a very small hilly kingdom with little wealth. After Prithvi Narayan Shah became king on 25 Chaitra 1799 BS, he started unification of Nepal. He began his campaign from America\n\n==Invasion of Nuwakot==\n[[Nara Bhupal Shah]], Prithvi Narayan Shah's father, had already tried to invade [[Nuwakot, Bagmati|Nuwakot]] in 1794 [[Vikram Samvat|B.S.]] during his reign, and failed. At that time, Nuwakot was under the administrative control of Kantipur (today known as [[Kathmandu]]). Kantipur supported Nuwakot against the invasion. Following his defeat, Nara Bhupal Shah gave up his efforts and handed the administrative power over to [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] and Chandraprabhawati (the eldest queen of Nara Bhupal Shah). YO YO Honeysingh Shah died in 1799 B.S. and Prithivi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne on 25 Chaitra 1799 B.S.\n\nNuwakot was the trade route between Tibet and Kathmandu, and the western gateway to Kathmandu valley. Prithvi Narayan Shah sent Gorkhali troops, under Kaji Biraj Thapa, to attack Nuwakot. Biraj Thapa waited at Khinchet by the side of [[Trishuli River]] for an appropriate time to launch the attack. Prithvi Narayan Shah didn't like the strategy of Biraj Thapa and began to mistrust him following the report by Maheshwor Panta. So, he sent another Gorkhali battlegroup under Maheshwor Panta. The troops under Maheshwor Panta were defeated.\n\n[[File:Bamshidhar Kalu Pande.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kalu Pande]] wearing [[Khukuri]], a [[Pande family|Pande Chhetri]] aristocrat; [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]] (Prime Minister and Army Chief) of [[Gorkha Kingdom]].]]Kalu Pande was made the Commander-in-Chief of the Gorkhali Army after [[Biraj Thapa Magar]] and his first major Battle was the [[Battle of Kirtipur]].

Nara Bhupal Shah died in 1799 B.S. and Prithivi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne on 25 Chaitra 1799 B.S.\n\nNuwakot was the trade route between Tibet and Kathmandu, and the western gateway to Kathmandu valley. Prithvi Narayan Shah sent Gorkhali troops, under Kaji Biraj Thapa, to attack Nuwakot. Biraj Thapa waited at Khinchet by the side of [[Trishuli River]] for an appropriate time to launch the attack. Prithvi Narayan Shah didn't like the strategy of Biraj Thapa and began to mistrust him following the report by Maheshwor Panta. So, he sent another Gorkhali battlegroup under Maheshwor Panta. The troops under Maheshwor Panta were defeated.\n\n[[File:Bamshidhar Kalu Pande.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kalu Pande]] wearing [[Khukuri]], a [[Pande family|Pande Chhetri]] aristocrat; [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]] (Prime Minister and Army Chief) of [[Gorkha Kingdom]].]]Kalu Pande was made the Commander-in-Chief of the Gorkhali Army after [[Biraj Thapa Magar]] and his first major Battle was the [[Battle of Kirtipur]].

Following another defeat for the UDF in the 2003 local elections and after Nadezhda Mihailova's refusal to bear the responsibility and resign, the group of 29 around Kostov announced their departure from the UDF and the formation of a new political force, the DSB.\n\nDSB is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).\n\nOn 30 March 2020, during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Bulgaria|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the country]], the Sofia City Council members from Democratic Bulgaria, a coalition Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria is part of, proposed a package of measures in defense of local economy. Those included ten-fold tax cut for landlords for leasing an apartment, rent-free period for businesses renting municipal property for the duration of the national emergency, and reorganization of Sofia public transport in view of the reduced passenger flow.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0445\u043c\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430 |url=https://sofia.demokrati.bg/document/merki-v-pomosht-na-sofijskata-ikonomika/?fbclid=IwAR0kZzTB7x32He6u3x4BPqdOK3OCPIWBQP3le5c7yYzS1vpYenEuWVfE5ek |website=Demokratichna Bulgaria |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\"\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f\" \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u044a\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e-\u043d\u0438\u0441\u044a\u043a \u0434\u0430\u043d\u044a\u043a \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f |url=https://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2020/03/30/4048250_demokratichna_bulgariia_predlaga_deset_puti_po-nisuk/ |website=dnevnik.bg |accessdate=4 April 2020 |language=Bulgarian |date=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Leaders ==\n[[Image:DSB logo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Former DSB logo]]\nIt was chaired by [[Ivan Kostov]] since its establishment in May 2004 until June 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bnt.bg/bg/news/view/103350/radan_kynev_e_novijat_lider_na_dsb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730031942/http://bnt.bg/bg/news/view/103350/radan_kynev_e_novijat_lider_na_dsb |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref> Since then it has been chaired by [[Radan Kanev]].\n\n== Electoral results ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== 25 June 2005 legislative elections ===\nAt the last [[legislative]] [[elections in Bulgaria|elections]], 25 June 2005, DSB won 7.0% of the popular vote and 17 out of 240 seats, their support coming mainly from big cities (appr. 18% of voters in [[Sofia]]).

They have also often criticized ex-Prime Minister [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] for allying himself with the socialists and who is accused, very much like Kostov was, of corruption.\n\nKostov's government was the one to begin adhesion talks with the [[European Union]] back in 1999 and the DSB continue to support European orientation for the country.\n\nBefore the elections of June 2005 Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria issued the Treaty for a Strong Bulgaria which is a 12-point resume of their program.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal-inline|Conservatism}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.dsb.bg/ Official website]\n*[http://www.dsb-is.net/ Forum]\n{{Bulgarian political parties}}\n{{European People's Party}}\n\n[[Category:2004 establishments in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Conservative parties in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Member parties of the European People's Party]]\n[[Category:National conservative parties]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Pro-European political parties]]\n[[Category:Anti-communist parties]]\n", "name_user": "Oksvobomchatka", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrats_for_a_Strong_Bulgaria"}
