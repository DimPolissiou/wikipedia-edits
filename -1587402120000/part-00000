Here he first coached players like [[Anja Andersen]] and his wife-to-be [[Susanne Munk Lauritsen]]. A few years later, he was asked to be coach for the national A-team,<ref name=dhf-trainers>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhf.dk/composite-438.htm |title=Dame A-tr\u00e6nere gennem \u00e5rene |publisher=Dansk H\u00e5ndbold Forbund |language=Danish |accessdate=15 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019012340/http://dhf.dk/composite-438.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2007 }}</ref> which nearly was closed in the early 1990s due to bad results. Wilbek took the challenge and promoted a couple of the youth players, and the team had its first success as finalist in the [[1993 World Women's Handball Championship]], losing only after extra time.\n\nIn the following years, Wilbek was in the lead of the team, that became one of the most successful national handball teams of all times and at the same time one of the most popular teams in Danish sport. The team was European Champions in 1994 and won bronze medals at [[1995 World Women's Handball Championship|1995 World Championship]]. The peak of the team was reached at the end of 1997, when the team was reigning [[1997 World Women's Handball Championship|World Champions (1997)]], [[European Women's Handball Championship|European Champions (1996)]], and [[Handball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Champions (1996)]]. This was the first time in handball history that a national team held all 3 major titles at the same time and only 2 other national teams have accomplished it since. It also marked the end of Wilbek's career as coach for the women's national team, having won everything.\n\n==Club handball==\nWilbek's initial work as a handball coach was in his own club, [[Virum Sorgenfri H\u00e5ndboldklub]], in 1985\u201388 (elite men). Just turned 30, he came to [[Viborg HK]] as a coach for the ambitious women's team, which by then had just been promoted to the Danish top league. Within a few years, he led the club to their first medals (silver in 1991), and the Danish National team now wanted him as a coach for the women's team.\n\nAfter five extremely successful years as national coach, Wilbek again turned towards club coaching. He was reappointed as coach for Viborg HK's elite women, and again he showed his excellence: The team became national champions for four consecutive years and reached the final in the 2001 [[EHF Champions League]].\n\nHe now needed new challenges and turned towards the club's men's team in the early 2000s. This marked Wilbek's least successful period as a coach with no medals won.  But he was still popular within the national handball association, and in 2005 he was appointed coach of the national men's team. In 2006 he led the team to a 3rd-place finish at the European Championships and in 2007 they finished 3rd in The World Championship.

Here he first coached players like [[Anja Andersen]] and his wife-to-be [[Susanne Munk Lauritsen]]. A few years later, he was asked to be coach for the national A-team,<ref name=dhf-trainers>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhf.dk/composite-438.htm |title=Dame A-tr\u00e6nere gennem \u00e5rene |publisher=Dansk H\u00e5ndbold Forbund |language=Danish |accessdate=15 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019012340/http://dhf.dk/composite-438.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2007 }}</ref> which nearly was closed in the early 1990s due to bad results. Wilbek took the challenge and promoted a couple of the youth players, and the team had its first success as finalist in the [[1993 World Women's Handball Championship]], losing only after extra time.\n\nIn the following years, Wilbek was in the lead of the team, that became one of the most successful national handball teams of all times and at the same time one of the most popular teams in Danish sport. The team was European Champions in 1994 and won bronze medals at [[1995 World Women's Handball Championship|1995 World Championship]]. The peak of the team was reached at the end of 1997, when the team was reigning [[1997 World Women's Handball Championship|World Champions (1997)]], [[European Women's Handball Championship|European Champions (1996)]], and [[Handball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Champions (1996)]]. This was the first time in handball history that a national team held all 3 major titels at the same time and only 2 other national teams have accomplished it since. It also marked the end of Wilbek's career as coach for the women's national team, having won everything.\n\n==Club handball==\nWilbek's initial work as a handball coach was in his own club, [[Virum Sorgenfri H\u00e5ndboldklub]], in 1985\u201388 (elite men). Just turned 30, he came to [[Viborg HK]] as a coach for the ambitious women's team, which by then had just been promoted to the Danish top league. Within a few years, he led the club to their first medals (silver in 1991), and the Danish National team now wanted him as a coach for the women's team.\n\nAfter five extremely successful years as national coach, Wilbek again turned towards club coaching. He was reappointed as coach for Viborg HK's elite women, and again he showed his excellence: The team became national champions for four consecutive years and reached the final in the 2001 [[EHF Champions League]].\n\nHe now needed new challenges and turned towards the club's men's team in the early 2000s. This marked Wilbek's least successful period as a coach with no medals won.  But he was still popular within the national handball association, and in 2005 he was appointed coach of the national men's team. In 2006 he led the team to a 3rd-place finish at the European Championships and in 2007 they finished 3rd in The World Championship. In 2008 he led the team to first place in the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship.\n\n== Danish Handball Federation ==\nIn 2016, after four years as a manager for the [[Danish Handball Federation]] DHF, Ulrik Wilbek was submitting his resignation to the federation.\n\nThe termination comes after the internal disturbances during the 2016 [[Olympics in Rio]], where Ulrik contacted bearing profiles of the men's national team to discuss coach [[Gu\u00f0mundur Gu\u00f0mundsson (handballer)|Gudmundur Gudmundsson]] future before the finals and asked the players if they felt coach Gudmundur Gudmundsson should be sacked.

He is best known for his work in [[comparative religion]], developing a [[Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhist-Christian]] [[interfaith dialogue]] which later also included [[Judaism]].

Suzuki]] in 1966, Masao Abe has served as the main representative of [[Zen Buddhism]] in Europe and North America.\"<ref>Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xiii-xix, xiii, in ''The Emptying God.

LaFleur.</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Training===\nAbe's father was a medical doctor, his mother a practitioner of [[Pure Land]] [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] Buddhism, from whom his early faith in [[Amitabha|Amida]] Buddha.<ref>Amit\u0101bha ([[Sanskrit language|Skt]]), Amida ([[Japanese language|Jpn]]), means ''boundless light''. \"One of the most important and popular buddhas of the [[Mahayana]] [school], unknown in early Buddhism.\" \"Amit\u0101bha is at the center of worship\" in [[Pure Land]] Buddhism. Access to liberation becomes possible by such worship (or even by [[Nembutsu]] (Jpn), ''calling out the name''). \"The veneration of Amit\u0101bha represents... a new path to salvation... owing to help from outside through the liberating will of... Amit\u0101bha.\" Ingrid Fischer-Schreiber, Franz-Karl Ehrhard, Michael S. Diener, ''Lexikon der \u0151stlichen Weisheitslehren'' (1986), translated as ''Shambala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen'' (1991), Amit\u0101bha entry, at 5-6. Such ''help from another'' or [[Tariki (Buddhism)|Tariki]] (Jpn) is often contrasted with [[Jiriki]] (Jpn), ''one's own power'' (as generally in Zen). Yet this distinction may be seen as artificial, due to each one being endowed with [[Buddha-nature]]. Cf., Jiriki entry, at 104. Abe, however, experienced this distinction as a source of personal turbulence; this spiritual crisis eventually led him to his own buddha-nature, under the guidance of his teacher Hisamatsu. See text here below.</ref> Born in [[Osaka]], Abe was the third of six children. His higher education began at Osaka Municipal University, where he studied Economics and Law. For four years during the late 1930s he worked in a business office at a private trading company in neighboring [[Kobe]]. Yet Abe was seriously troubled by an ongoing personal crisis, which stemmed from the perceived conflict: rationality versus faith in the Amida of Pure Land Buddhism. This conflict he thought he could conclusively resolve in favor of faith through the study of philosophy, by which he could overcome objections posed by reason.<ref>Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xiii-xiv, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 3-9, 3-4, in ''Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue'' (Rutland VT: Charles E. Tuttle 1998), edited by Donald W. Mitchell.</ref>\n\nAbe entered [[Kyoto University]] in April 1942.<ref>In 1949 at Kyoto University, Abe would complete the graduate course (under the old Japanese system) in Buddhism and comparative religion. Donald W. Mitchell, \"Preface\" at xi-xxiv, xii, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref> It was a courageous step, as he changed career direction in mid-stream, exceptional in Japanese life, yet even more so considering the current political situation. He studied Western philosophy under [[Hajime Tanabe]]. Also, Abe studied [[Zen]] under the direction of [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]], a philosophy professor at Kyoto University and a lay practitioner of the [[Rinzai school]]. Guided by Hisamatsu,<ref>Prof. Hisamatsu became known and admired in the West. In 1958 he visited [[Carl Jung]], their conversation being transcribed.

Society'' [Formless self, All humankind, Supra-historical].</ref><ref>Cf., Felix E. Prieto, \"The F.A.S. Acronym in Masao Abe's Life Trajectory\" at 35-40, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref><ref>The wartime government in Japan generally favored an ultra-nationalist version of [[Shinto]], although all religious groups were compelled to support the war. William K. Bunce, ''Religions in Japan'' (C I & E 1948; reprinted 1954 by Charles E. Tuttle, Rutland VT) at 37-42.</ref> Professor Hisamatsu challenged Abe's quasi-[[theism|theistic]] faith in Amida Buddha; instead Hisamatsu became for Abe a vital religious model, of a rigorous adherent of [[Sunyata]] (which may be called ''emptiness'') as an ultimate reality. In consequence, Abe came to understand Amida Buddha as a sacred fiction.<ref name=\"Christopher Ives 1990\">Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xiv-xv, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>\"Part of the strength of Abe's approach to Christianity is his uncompromising rejection of theism. ... Abe himself grew up in a quasi-theistic form of Buddhism and was converted away from that to what he is convinced is the true and pure form. Hence he understands theism from within and hopes to liberate from it those who are still attached to it. The contrast to the biblical faiths thus becomes stark.\" [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], \"Preface\" at ix-xi, xi, to ''The Emptying God'' (1990)</ref>\n\nAbe's spiritual progression under Hisamatsu was complex and dialectical. Hisamatsu taught that the revered image of Amida Buddha was but a stage on the way to realizing a \"formless\" Buddha, whereby one could [[satori|awaken]] to one's True Self.<ref>\"Abe was shocked to hear [Hisamatsu] use the same basic Buddhist terminology that Abe was used to, but with what seemed to be a completely opposite interpretation!\" Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 3-9, 5, in Mitchell (ed.), ''Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref> Nonetheless Abe first reacted to Hisamatsu by coming to discover and experience an infinite grace from the Amida Buddha. Abe's profound quest continued. In December 1951, during a [[Sesshin|group Zen sitting]] at the Reiun Temple of the [[My\u014dshin-ji]] in Kyoto, Abe personally challenged Hisamatsu, screaming to him, \"Is that the True Self?\" Hisamatsu replied, \"That's the True Self.\" Thereafter Abe entered an intense phase and struggled with the view that \"It's all a lie!\" (which he cried out while dousing himself with a bucket of ice water at a subsequent group sitting). He agonized over the seeming proximity of the Deity and the devil, and with his own complicity. Finally, Abe told Hisamatsu, \"I just cannot find any place where I can stand.\" Hisamatsu told him, \"''Stand right at that place where there is nowhere to stand.''\"<ref>Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 5-7, in ''Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref>\n\nAlong this way Abe confronted, and managed to distinguish and overcome, a \"positive nihilism\" associated with the secular, irreligious philosopher [[Frederich Nietzsche]].<ref>Later, Abe would write of an alliance of \"authentic religiosity\" in order to counter various \"anti-religious ideologies\" in our societies. Abe, \"Author's Introduction\" at xxii, to his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985).</ref> Reflecting on his life development, Abe acknowledged the crucial role of Shin'ichi Hisamatsu in his spiritual formation. \"Without him I am not what I am.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Ives 1990\"/>\n\n===Academia===\nAmong Abe's chief academic influences would be the aforementioned [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]] (1889\u20131980) and also [[Keiji Nishitani]] (1900\u20131990), as well as [[Hajime Tanabe]] (1885\u20131962), key professors for Abe at Kyoto University, and [[Kitaro Nishida]] (1870\u20131945), teacher of Hisamatsu and Nishitani, and teacher of his own successor Tanabe. Abe follows Nishida's [[Kyoto school]] of philosophy. During the 1950s and early 1960s Abe was in communication with the well-known Buddhist scholar [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] (1870\u20131966), e.g., at Columbia University in New York City; Abe is said to have later assumed Suzuki's r\u00f4le as academic transmitter of Buddhism. Also in New York City, at the Union Theological Seminary, Abe encountered the Christian professors and teachers [[Paul Tillich]] (1886\u20131965) and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] (1892\u20131971).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xvi, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>Abe received a Rockefeller grant in 1955 which he used to study in New York. Donald W. Mitchell, \"Preface\" at xi-xxiv, xiii, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1980, Abe served as professor of philosophy at [[Nara University of Education|Nara University]]. Before he had been professor at Kyoto Women's College (1946\u20131948) and [[Otani University]] (1948\u20131950). Thereafter, while at Nara, Abe was concurrently professor at [[Kyoto University]] from 1955 to 1958, and from 1964-1980 professor at Hana Zono University. Also in the mid-1950s he studied [[Christian theology]] in New York City at the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and at [[Columbia University]]. Then in 1980 he left Nara University and moved to California, to the Department of Religion at the [[Claremont Graduate School]], and later in 1983 to the [[University of Hawaii]] where he served as Professor of [[Japanese philosophy|Japanese Philosophy]]. From 1965 Abe participated and made presentations at many universities and colleges throughout the U.S.A. while serving as a visiting professor in residence (with his wife Ikuko).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Masao Abe, ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985), edited by Wm. R. LaFleur, at ii.</ref><ref>Abe has served at: [[Haverford College]], [[Graduate Theological Union]], [[Columbia University]], [[University of Chicago]], [[Princeton University]], [[Claremont Graduate School]], [[Purdue University]], [[University of Hawaii]], [[Carleton College]], and [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] (2000-2001).</ref> During these years Abe shared in the Buddhist-Christian dialogue while at universities in Europe.<ref>Donald W. Mitchell, \"Preface\" at xv, to ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998). Abe's venues included the [[University of Oslo]], the [[University of Bonn]], the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], the [[University of Heidelberg]], and the [[University of Munich]].</ref>\n\nAbe contributed to and led many conferences on comparative religion, Buddhism, and related subjects. He was perennially involved with: the [[Philosophy East and West|East-West Philosophers' Conference]] at the [[University of Hawaii]]; and the ''International Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter'' (the \"Abe-Cobb group\") which, along with Professor [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], Abe directed.<ref>Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xvii, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>Donald W. Mitchell, \"Preface\" at xi-xxiv, xv, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref>\n\nIn addition to his contributions of creative insight and scholarship, Masao Abe also brought to interfaith meetings a serenity and a quiet charm. Here, for example, his fellow academic [[Arvind Sharma]] recalls a moment with Abe at a conference in 1986:\n\n<blockquote>Abe broke into a smile. I still remember it vividly because it had a compelling ineffable quality about it. It was so totally unencumbered. It seemed curiously and totally detached from the environment, a happening complete in itself, with a childlike simplicity beguiling in its guilelessness. When his face assumed its normal expression, one was left with the feeling of something very precious\u2014found fleetingly and then lost irretrievably\u2014until he smiled again.<ref>Arvind Sharma, \"A Chrysanthemum with a Lotus Stalk: Reminiscences from a Hindu Perspective\" at 326-334, 328, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (Boston: Tuttle 1998).</ref></blockquote>\n\nApparently, the source of this \"giving gift\" had passed through spiritual trials. Abe earlier was required to walk down a path of terrifying dread, and to make a leap into the abyss, in order to find \"that place where there is nowhere to stand.\"<ref>Cf., Steven Antinoff, \"The Fire in the Lotus\" at 10-21, 20, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998). Antinoff underscores Abe's indominable nature by relating the story that Abe had \"been barred from the monastery where he trained for accusing the [[R\u014dshi|roshi]] in a [[sanzen]] interview of acting.\" Antinoff (1988) at 13.</ref><ref>Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 7, in ''Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref>\n\n===Dialogue===\nAbe sought to advance the [[Interfaith dialogue|interreligious dialogue]] while serving in his widespread teaching assignments; he led many seminars on Buddhism and western religions, particularly Christianity.<ref>Abe defined the unique, universal character of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism as being based on conscious choice rather than ethnic birth as the ideal of membership. His focus was on the two religions he was most familiar with. Abe, \"The End of World Religion\" (''The Eastern Buddhist'' 8/1 [c.1975]), reprinted in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985) at 261-275, 262-263, 265.</ref> A frequent procedure followed by the convened representatives of different religions was: first to attempt to understand the other's faith perspective from the inside (without compromising each one's own faith), to the extent of being able to \"see\" how things may look from the other's point of view; second, there would follow a period during which each would \"return\" to their own faith; thereafter, a more fruitful discussion might commence. Abe further sought to encourage dialogue through his various philosophical and spiritual writings.<ref>E.g., his essay \"[[Kenosis|Kenotic]] God and Dynamic [[Shunyata|Sunyata]]\" which appeared in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll, New York: Orbis 1990) and again in ''Divine Emptiness and Historical Fullness'' (Trinity Press 1995). This essay has been published several times together with responses by Christians and Jews.</ref><ref>Cf., [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5009563216 Excerpt from Article by Charles B. Jones].</ref>\n\nGenerally Abe has received praise for his efforts. Professor [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] found that the Buddhist scholar's presentation was profound and precise concerning a central topic of Christian theology. \"Here reciprocal understanding is not only furthered, but Christianity and Buddhism in their immiscible difference are led into a common reality. In light of this common reality, perhaps a mutual transformation does not yet begin, but certainly a reciprocal liking and opening for each other.\"<ref>J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, \"God is Unselfish Love\" at 116-124, 116, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990), edited by Cobb and Ives.</ref>\n\nIn 1983 Professor Abe disclosed aspects of his inner motivation. He wrote that, in addition to his abiding interest in Buddhism, he was profoundly concerned with the spiritual foundation for all of \"humanity in a global age. To provide this foundation, a comparative and dialogical study of Buddhism and Western thought, Christianity included, is absolutely necessary.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"Author's Introduction\" to ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985) at xxiii.</ref>\n\n==An essay with responses==\n* Abe's essay is entitled \"[[Kenosis|Kenotic]] God and Dynamic [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]]\", which discusses ''emptiness'' in Christianity and Buddhism. Abe refers to [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] in his letter to the [[Philippians]] 2:5-11, especially the verses stating that \"Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\" Abe eventually extrapolates to posit an emptying of [[God the Father#Christianiy|God the Father]], and hence an ontological resemblance between Christianity and the Buddhist concept of ''sunyata'' or emptiness as an ultimate reality. In the process, Abe discusses Buddhist social ethics and social responsibility. Also, he addresses the [[Shoah]]; here, he raises the difficult issue of a \"collective karma\" manifested in guilt felt by those far removed from the time and locale of these genocidal crimes. Abe writes for an educated multi-religious readership, with keen awareness and observation, informed to a certain extent by [[Process theology]] developed within modern Christianity, and from a perspective nurtured in the [[Kyoto school]] of [[Buddhist philosophy]]. His essay has been published as follows.\n** ''The Emptying God: A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation'' (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis 1990), edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and Christopher Ives. Professor Cobb was a leader in Process theology. Herein Abe's essay \"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\" appears, which is addressed by one Jewish ([[Eugene Borowitz]]) and six Christian ([[Thomas J. J. Altizer]], John B. Cobb, Jr., [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]], [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], Schubert M. Ogden, and David Tracy) theologians. Then follows a \"Rejoinder\" by Abe. Several subsequent responses and replies appear in the journal ''Buddhist-Christian Studies'' (Honolulu: Univ.of Hawaii).\n** ''Divine Emptiness and Historical Fullness. A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation with Masao Abe'' (Valley Forge: Trinity Press 1995), edited by Christopher Ives. Abe's essay \"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\" appears again (Part I) and is addressed afresh by eight new scholars. Two Jewish responses by [[Richard L. Rubenstein|Richard Rubenstein]] and Sandra B. Lubarsky are followed by four Christian, i.e., by Heinrich Ott, [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]], Hans Waldenfels, and Christopher Ives (Part II). Abe then replies (Part III). The conclusion presents the two responses of [[Hans K\u00fcng]], and of [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], to each of which Abe replies (Part IV).\n*** [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/buddhist-christian_studies/v019/19.1shirley.html Book Review by Edward L.

His Philosophy and Religion'' (Albany: SUNY 1992).</ref>\n\nD\u014dgen puzzled over a seeming contradiction in Buddhism. All sentient beings are originally [[Bodhi|enlightened]], yet Buddhist teachings \"arouse the longing for enlightenment\" in those who hear it. If we do religious practice we may become enlightened due to an \"acquired awakening\" yet \"original awakening\" is ours \"before our parents were born\". D\u014dgen rejects as [[naturalistic fallacy]] a theory of \"original awakening\" that would equate a given human self-consciousness with genuine enlightenment. Also D\u014dgen rejects the idea that practice is a means to the goal of enlightenment. The [[epistemological]] process of enlightenment is undertaken by zen practice, but the process itself becomes enlightenment, i.e., the path is the way of awakening. Abe quotes D\u014dgen: \"In the Buddha [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], practice and realization are identical. [O]ne's initial negotiating of the Way in itself is the whole of original realization. Thus, even while directed to practice, one is told not to anticipate a realization apart from practice, because practice points directly to original realization.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 25-68, 57, in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (University of Hawaii 1985).</ref>\n\nInstead of waiting for the time of awakening while sitting in meditation, one is \"directly knowing temporal conditions\" for the \"time has already arrived\". \"There is no time that is not the right time.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 35-76, 70, in his ''A Study of D\u014dgen. His Philosophy and Religion'' (SUNY 1992).</ref> \"D\u014dgen denies continuity of time and emphasizes the independence of each point of time... .\" Prof. Abe then quotes D\u014dgen to illustrate:\n\n<blockquote>\"[I]t being an established teaching of Buddhism not to speak of life becoming death, Buddhism speaks of the unborn. It being a confirmed Buddhist teaching that death does not become life, it speaks of non-extinction. Life is a stage of time and death is a stage of time, like, for example, winter and spring. We do not suppose that winter becomes spring, or say that spring becomes summer.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 25-68, 63, in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (University of Hawaii 1985).</ref></blockquote>\n\nSubjectively from within, \"the process of our living-dying [is] being without beginning and without end.\" For Buddhists, there is no beginning of the universe (no creation), and there is no end (no last judgment). \"We must realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of [[samsara]], that is, the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of living-dying.\"<ref name=\"Masao Abe 1998\"/> Prof. Abe mentions several experiences:\n\n* \"[E]ach and every moment can be a beginning and an end in itself: time begins and ends with each moment. Accordingly, time is not understood to be a unidirectional movement but is seen as a sheer series of moments that can move reciprocally. Here a sort of reversibility of time is realized.\"\n* \"[I]f we clearly realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of living-dying ''at this particular moment'', the whole process of living-dying is concentrated within this moment. In other words, each moment embraces the whole process of beginningless and endless time within itself. Thus, one can in fact transcend [[time]] at this very moment.\"\n* \"The Buddhist view, based on full immersion in the depth of the moment, is that there is no difference between past and future. The temporal distinction belongs to the observer's perspective on the horizontal and historical plane. In the vertical or depth dimension, Buddhists insist, time is overcome.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"A Response\" at 371-409, 376, 375-376, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'', Mitchell, editor (Boston: Tuttle 1998).</ref>\n* \"Although [[karma]] works deterministically on the horizontal dimension of time, once the vertical, or transtemporal, dimension is opened up as one awakens to the truth of no-self, that person is no longer a slave to karma but becomes its master. This means that on the basis of the realization of the true self as no-self at the bottomless depth of the vertical dimension of time, the present act can emancipate one's self from past karma and create new karma that will affect the future as, for instance, in the form of a vow.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen's View of Time and Space\" at 77-105, 103, in his ''A Study of D\u014dgen.

LaFleur.</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Training===\nAbe's father was a medical doctor, his mother a practitioner of [[Pure Land]] [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] Buddhism, from whom his early faith in [[Amitabha|Amida]] Buddha.<ref>Amit\u0101bha ([[Sanskrit language|Skt]]), Amida ([[Japanese language|Jpn]]), means ''boundless light''. \"One of the most important and popular buddhas of the [[Mahayana]] [school], unknown in early Buddhism.\" \"Amit\u0101bha is at the center of worship\" in [[Pure Land]] Buddhism. Access to liberation becomes possible by such worship (or even by [[Nembutsu]] (Jpn), ''calling out the name''). \"The veneration of Amit\u0101bha represents... a new path to salvation... owing to help from outside through the liberating will of... Amit\u0101bha.\" Ingrid Fischer-Schreiber, Franz-Karl Ehrhard, Michael S. Diener, ''Lexikon der \u0151stlichen Weisheitslehren'' (1986), translated as ''Shambala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen'' (1991), Amit\u0101bha entry, at 5-6. Such ''help from another'' or [[Tariki (Buddhism)|Tariki]] (Jpn) is often contrasted with [[Jiriki]] (Jpn), ''one's own power'' (as generally in Zen). Yet this distinction may be seen as artificial, due to each one being endowed with [[Buddha-nature]]. Cf., Jiriki entry, at 104. Abe, however, experienced this distinction as a source of personal turbulence; this spiritual crisis eventually led him to his own buddha-nature, under the guidance of his teacher Hisamatsu. See text here below.</ref> Born in [[Osaka]], Abe was the third of six children. His higher education began at Osaka Municipal University, where he studied Economics and Law. For four years during the late 1930s he worked in a business office at a private trading company in neighboring [[Kobe]]. Yet Abe was seriously troubled by an ongoing personal crisis, which stemmed from the perceived conflict: rationality versus faith in the Amida of Pure Land Buddhism. This conflict he thought he could conclusively resolve in favor of faith through the study of philosophy, by which he could overcome objections posed by reason.<ref>Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xiii-xiv, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>Jeff M.

Donald W. Mitchell, \"Preface\" at xi-xxiv, xii, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref> It was a courageous step, as he changed career direction in mid-stream, exceptional in Japanese life, yet even more so considering the current political situation.

Also, Abe studied [[Zen]] under the direction of [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]], a philosophy professor at Kyoto University and a lay practitioner of the [[Rinzai school]]. Guided by Hisamatsu,<ref>Prof. Hisamatsu became known and admired in the West. In 1958 he visited [[Carl Jung]], their conversation being transcribed.

Tuttle, Rutland VT) at 37-42.</ref> Professor Hisamatsu challenged Abe's quasi-[[theism|theistic]] faith in Amida Buddha; instead Hisamatsu became for Abe a vital religious model, of a rigorous adherent of [[Sunyata]] (which may be called ''emptiness'') as an ultimate reality. In consequence, Abe came to understand Amida Buddha as a sacred fiction.<ref name=\"Christopher Ives 1990\">Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xiv-xv, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>\"Part of the strength of Abe's approach to Christianity is his uncompromising rejection of theism. ... Abe himself grew up in a quasi-theistic form of Buddhism and was converted away from that to what he is convinced is the true and pure form. Hence he understands theism from within and hopes to liberate from it those who are still attached to it. The contrast to the biblical faiths thus becomes stark.\" [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], \"Preface\" at ix-xi, xi, to ''The Emptying God'' (1990)</ref>\n\nAbe's spiritual progression under Hisamatsu was complex and dialectical. Hisamatsu taught that the revered image of Amida Buddha was but a stage on the way to realizing a \"formless\" Buddha, whereby one could [[satori|awaken]] to one's True Self.<ref>\"Abe was shocked to hear [Hisamatsu] use the same basic Buddhist terminology that Abe was used to, but with what seemed to be a completely opposite interpretation!\" Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 3-9, 5, in Mitchell (ed.), ''Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref> Nonetheless Abe first reacted to Hisamatsu by coming to discover and experience an infinite grace from the Amida Buddha. Abe's profound quest continued. In December 1951, during a [[Sesshin|group Zen sitting]] at the Reiun Temple of the [[My\u014dshin-ji]] in Kyoto, Abe personally challenged Hisamatsu, screaming to him, \"Is that the True Self?\" Hisamatsu replied, \"That's the True Self.\" Thereafter Abe entered an intense phase and struggled with the view that \"It's all a lie!\" (which he cried out while dousing himself with a bucket of ice water at a subsequent group sitting). He agonized over the seeming proximity of the Deity and the devil, and with his own complicity. Finally, Abe told Hisamatsu, \"I just cannot find any place where I can stand.\" Hisamatsu told him, \"''Stand right at that place where there is nowhere to stand.''\"<ref>Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 5-7, in ''Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue'' (1998).</ref>\n\nAlong this way Abe confronted, and managed to distinguish and overcome, a \"positive nihilism\" associated with the secular, irreligious philosopher [[Frederich Nietzsche]].<ref>Later, Abe would write of an alliance of \"authentic religiosity\" in order to counter various \"anti-religious ideologies\" in our societies. Abe, \"Author's Introduction\" at xxii, to his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985).</ref> Reflecting on his life development, Abe acknowledged the crucial role of Shin'ichi Hisamatsu in his spiritual formation. \"Without him I am not what I am.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Ives 1990\"/>\n\n===Academia===\nAmong Abe's chief academic influences would be the aforementioned [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]] (1889\u20131980) and also [[Keiji Nishitani]] (1900\u20131990), as well as [[Hajime Tanabe]] (1885\u20131962), key professors for Abe at Kyoto University, and [[Kitaro Nishida]] (1870\u20131945), teacher of Hisamatsu and Nishitani, and teacher of his own successor Tanabe. Abe follows Nishida's [[Kyoto school]] of philosophy. During the 1950s and early 1960s Abe was in communication with the well-known Buddhist scholar [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] (1870\u20131966), e.g., at Columbia University in New York City; Abe is said to have later assumed Suzuki's r\u00f4le as academic transmitter of Buddhism. Also in New York City, at the Union Theological Seminary, Abe encountered the Christian professors and teachers [[Paul Tillich]] (1886\u20131965) and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] (1892\u20131971).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Christopher Ives, \"Introduction\" at xvi, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).</ref><ref>Abe received a Rockefeller grant in 1955 which he used to study in New York.

Before he had been professor at Kyoto Women's College (1946\u20131948) and [[Otani University]] (1948\u20131950). Thereafter, while at Nara, Abe was concurrently professor at [[Kyoto University]] from 1955 to 1958, and from 1964-1980 professor at Hana Zono University. Also in the mid-1950s he studied [[Christian theology]] in New York City at the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and at [[Columbia University]]. Then in 1980 he left Nara University and moved to California, to the Department of Religion at the [[Claremont Graduate School]], and later in 1983 to the [[University of Hawaii]] where he served as Professor of [[Japanese philosophy|Japanese Philosophy]]. From 1965 Abe participated and made presentations at many universities and colleges throughout the U.S.A. while serving as a visiting professor in residence (with his wife Ikuko).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Masao Abe, ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985), edited by Wm.

Here, for example, his fellow academic [[Arvind Sharma]] recalls a moment with Abe at a conference in 1986:\n\n<blockquote>Abe broke into a smile. I still remember it vividly because it had a compelling ineffable quality about it. It was so totally unencumbered. It seemed curiously and totally detached from the environment, a happening complete in itself, with a childlike simplicity beguiling in its guilelessness.

A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (Boston: Tuttle 1998).</ref></blockquote>\n\nApparently, the source of this \"giving gift\" had passed through spiritual trials. Abe earlier was required to walk down a path of terrifying dread, and to make a leap into the abyss, in order to find \"that place where there is nowhere to stand.\"<ref>Cf., Steven Antinoff, \"The Fire in the Lotus\" at 10-21, 20, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'' (1998). Antinoff underscores Abe's indominable nature by relating the story that Abe had \"been barred from the monastery where he trained for accusing the [[R\u014dshi|roshi]] in a [[sanzen]] interview of acting.\" Antinoff (1988) at 13.</ref><ref>Jeff M. Shore, \"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\" at 7, in ''Masao Abe.

His focus was on the two religions he was most familiar with. Abe, \"The End of World Religion\" (''The Eastern Buddhist'' 8/1 [c.1975]), reprinted in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985) at 261-275, 262-263, 265.</ref> A frequent procedure followed by the convened representatives of different religions was: first to attempt to understand the other's faith perspective from the inside (without compromising each one's own faith), to the extent of being able to \"see\" how things may look from the other's point of view; second, there would follow a period during which each would \"return\" to their own faith; thereafter, a more fruitful discussion might commence. Abe further sought to encourage dialogue through his various philosophical and spiritual writings.<ref>E.g., his essay \"[[Kenosis|Kenotic]] God and Dynamic [[Shunyata|Sunyata]]\" which appeared in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll, New York: Orbis 1990) and again in ''Divine Emptiness and Historical Fullness'' (Trinity Press 1995). This essay has been published several times together with responses by Christians and Jews.</ref><ref>Cf., [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5009563216 Excerpt from Article by Charles B. Jones].</ref>\n\nGenerally Abe has received praise for his efforts. Professor [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] found that the Buddhist scholar's presentation was profound and precise concerning a central topic of Christian theology. \"Here reciprocal understanding is not only furthered, but Christianity and Buddhism in their immiscible difference are led into a common reality. In light of this common reality, perhaps a mutual transformation does not yet begin, but certainly a reciprocal liking and opening for each other.\"<ref>J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, \"God is Unselfish Love\" at 116-124, 116, in ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990), edited by Cobb and Ives.</ref>\n\nIn 1983 Professor Abe disclosed aspects of his inner motivation. He wrote that, in addition to his abiding interest in Buddhism, he was profoundly concerned with the spiritual foundation for all of \"humanity in a global age. To provide this foundation, a comparative and dialogical study of Buddhism and Western thought, Christianity included, is absolutely necessary.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"Author's Introduction\" to ''Zen and Western Thought'' (Univ.of Hawaii 1985) at xxiii.</ref>\n\n==An essay with responses==\n* Abe's essay is entitled \"[[Kenosis|Kenotic]] God and Dynamic [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]]\", which discusses ''emptiness'' in Christianity and Buddhism. Abe refers to [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] in his letter to the [[Philippians]] 2:5-11, especially the verses stating that \"Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\" Abe eventually extrapolates to posit an emptying of [[God the Father#Christianiy|God the Father]], and hence an ontological resemblance between Christianity and the Buddhist concept of ''sunyata'' or emptiness as an ultimate reality. In the process, Abe discusses Buddhist social ethics and social responsibility. Also, he addresses the [[Shoah]]; here, he raises the difficult issue of a \"collective karma\" manifested in guilt felt by those far removed from the time and locale of these genocidal crimes. Abe writes for an educated multi-religious readership, with keen awareness and observation, informed to a certain extent by [[Process theology]] developed within modern Christianity, and from a perspective nurtured in the [[Kyoto school]] of [[Buddhist philosophy]]. His essay has been published as follows.\n** ''The Emptying God: A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation'' (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis 1990), edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and Christopher Ives. Professor Cobb was a leader in Process theology. Herein Abe's essay \"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\" appears, which is addressed by one Jewish ([[Eugene Borowitz]]) and six Christian ([[Thomas J. J. Altizer]], John B. Cobb, Jr., [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]], [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], Schubert M. Ogden, and David Tracy) theologians. Then follows a \"Rejoinder\" by Abe. Several subsequent responses and replies appear in the journal ''Buddhist-Christian Studies'' (Honolulu: Univ.of Hawaii).\n** ''Divine Emptiness and Historical Fullness. A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation with Masao Abe'' (Valley Forge: Trinity Press 1995), edited by Christopher Ives. Abe's essay \"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\" appears again (Part I) and is addressed afresh by eight new scholars. Two Jewish responses by [[Richard L. Rubenstein|Richard Rubenstein]] and Sandra B. Lubarsky are followed by four Christian, i.e., by Heinrich Ott, [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]], Hans Waldenfels, and Christopher Ives (Part II). Abe then replies (Part III). The conclusion presents the two responses of [[Hans K\u00fcng]], and of [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], to each of which Abe replies (Part IV).\n*** [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/buddhist-christian_studies/v019/19.1shirley.html Book Review by Edward L. Shirley]\n*** [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/harold.htm Book Review by Harold Kasimow]\n** Previously Abe had authored a forerunner of this essay, entitled \"Buddhism and Christianity as a Problem of Today\". It appeared in the periodical ''Japanese Religions'' in 1963, here also followed by Western responses.<ref>''Japanese Religions'' volume 3, issues 3-4 (1963), and following.</ref><ref>Abe's earlier essay is mentioned both in Cobb's \"Preface\" at x, and in Ives's \"Introduction\" at xvii, in the collaborative book ''The Emptying God'' (Maryknoll NY: Orbis Press 1990).</ref>\n\n==A Zen view of time==\n\nBy realization through Zen practice of the Buddhist teaching of the impermanence of all things ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: [[anitya]]) ([[Japanese language|Jpn]]: muj\u014d),<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 25-68, 48-49, 55, 56-57, in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (University of Hawaii 1985).</ref> we come to experience that we are living-dying at each and every moment. \"If we grasp our lives not objectively from without but subjectively from within, we are not moving from life to death but are in the midst of this process of living-dying.\"<ref name=\"Masao Abe 1998\">Masao Abe, \"A Response\" at 371-409, 376, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'', Mitchell, editor (Boston: Tuttle 1998).</ref> By a careful reading of [[D\u014dgen Zenji|D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253) and a watchful understanding of the inner sense of time, Abe learns and teaches how the objectification of time can alienate us from our own experience of its impermanence.<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen's View of Time and Space\" at 77-105, 99, in his ''A Study of D\u014dgen. His Philosophy and Religion'' (Albany: SUNY 1992).</ref>\n\nD\u014dgen puzzled over a seeming contradiction in Buddhism. All sentient beings are originally [[Bodhi|enlightened]], yet Buddhist teachings \"arouse the longing for enlightenment\" in those who hear it. If we do religious practice we may become enlightened due to an \"acquired awakening\" yet \"original awakening\" is ours \"before our parents were born\". D\u014dgen rejects as [[naturalistic fallacy]] a theory of \"original awakening\" that would equate a given human self-consciousness with genuine enlightenment. Also D\u014dgen rejects the idea that practice is a means to the goal of enlightenment. The [[epistemological]] process of enlightenment is undertaken by zen practice, but the process itself becomes enlightenment, i.e., the path is the way of awakening. Abe quotes D\u014dgen: \"In the Buddha [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], practice and realization are identical. [O]ne's initial negotiating of the Way in itself is the whole of original realization. Thus, even while directed to practice, one is told not to anticipate a realization apart from practice, because practice points directly to original realization.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 25-68, 57, in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (University of Hawaii 1985).</ref>\n\nInstead of waiting for the time of awakening while sitting in meditation, one is \"directly knowing temporal conditions\" for the \"time has already arrived\". \"There is no time that is not the right time.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 35-76, 70, in his ''A Study of D\u014dgen. His Philosophy and Religion'' (SUNY 1992).</ref> \"D\u014dgen denies continuity of time and emphasizes the independence of each point of time... .\" Prof. Abe then quotes D\u014dgen to illustrate:\n\n<blockquote>\"[I]t being an established teaching of Buddhism not to speak of life becoming death, Buddhism speaks of the unborn. It being a confirmed Buddhist teaching that death does not become life, it speaks of non-extinction. Life is a stage of time and death is a stage of time, like, for example, winter and spring. We do not suppose that winter becomes spring, or say that spring becomes summer.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen on Buddha Nature\" at 25-68, 63, in his ''Zen and Western Thought'' (University of Hawaii 1985).</ref></blockquote>\n\nSubjectively from within, \"the process of our living-dying [is] being without beginning and without end.\" For Buddhists, there is no beginning of the universe (no creation), and there is no end (no last judgment). \"We must realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of [[samsara]], that is, the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of living-dying.\"<ref name=\"Masao Abe 1998\"/> Prof. Abe mentions several experiences:\n\n* \"[E]ach and every moment can be a beginning and an end in itself: time begins and ends with each moment. Accordingly, time is not understood to be a unidirectional movement but is seen as a sheer series of moments that can move reciprocally. Here a sort of reversibility of time is realized.\"\n* \"[I]f we clearly realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of living-dying ''at this particular moment'', the whole process of living-dying is concentrated within this moment. In other words, each moment embraces the whole process of beginningless and endless time within itself. Thus, one can in fact transcend [[time]] at this very moment.\"\n* \"The Buddhist view, based on full immersion in the depth of the moment, is that there is no difference between past and future. The temporal distinction belongs to the observer's perspective on the horizontal and historical plane. In the vertical or depth dimension, Buddhists insist, time is overcome.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"A Response\" at 371-409, 376, 375-376, in ''Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue'', Mitchell, editor (Boston: Tuttle 1998).</ref>\n* \"Although [[karma]] works deterministically on the horizontal dimension of time, once the vertical, or transtemporal, dimension is opened up as one awakens to the truth of no-self, that person is no longer a slave to karma but becomes its master. This means that on the basis of the realization of the true self as no-self at the bottomless depth of the vertical dimension of time, the present act can emancipate one's self from past karma and create new karma that will affect the future as, for instance, in the form of a vow.\"<ref>Masao Abe, \"D\u014dgen's View of Time and Space\" at 77-105, 103, in his ''A Study of D\u014dgen.
