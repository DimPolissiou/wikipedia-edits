He approaches a grave and pays his respects. The police officer is revealed to be Murthy ([[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]]).\n\n'''Act 1'''\n\nMurthy is in a train compartment with Indira ([[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]]) and Vyasaraya ([[Vajramuni]]). Vyasaraya and Murthy start small talk about drama, music and stuff. Vyasaraya tells Murthy that he is taking Indira to a drama company. On goading from Vyasaraya, Murthy sings \"Anuragada.\" Indira takes an instant liking to Murthy. Meanwhile, Vyasaraya gets down the train to get some coffee, sees a man in a long coat and hides from him. He almost misses the train and luckily Murthy opens the door just in time to let Vyasaraya in. Vyasaraya tells Murthy that the man in the long coat is a pimp preying on unmarried girls like Indira. He asks Murthy to look after Indira until he returns and gets off the train.\n\nThe man (Inspector Rajagopal) in the long coat comes to Murthy and Indira and tells them Vyasaraya is actually the pimp and has made a living cheating innocent girls like Indira. Before Murthy can tell the cop about Vyasaraya he gets down the train and Vyasaraya reappears. This time he has a knife; Murthy fights Vyasaraya and tries to find Inspector Rajagopal but cannot find him. In panic, Indira gets off the train and so does Murthy. They try to find a place to stay the night in Traveler's Bungalow. Indira is impressed by Murthy's gentle behavior (\"Ee Kannigu Hennigu,\" a dream sequence song).\n\nIndira reveals to Murthy that Vyasaraya paid Rs.1000/- to her poor mother with the promise that he'll ensure that Indira joins a drama company. Indira asks Murthy to take her to her hometown of Navilukere near Sagar, as he wants to go back to her mom and two younger sisters. He agrees to take her to her hometown in the morning; unfortunately in the morning Vyasaraya and his henchmen attack Murthy who suffers a head injury. Vyasaraya elopes with Indira not to be seen anywhere.\n\nMurthy is devastated and reaches out to Inspector Rajagopal to find Indira but with no luck. On screen are Murthy's mother ([[Pandari Bai]]) and his friends Sundar Raj, Umesh and Mandeep Rai.\n\n'''Act 2'''\n\nMurthy tries to regain his life back after the Indira episode until he sees a drunk woman, Clara ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]), driving her Premier Padmini on railway tracks. Murthy, being the gentleman as ever, finds out that she's staying in Gulmohar suite and drives her home. There he meets Clara's brother Anthony who reveals why Clara started drinking in the first place - Clara is engaged to marry Reggie ([[Avinash]]). Reggie is revealed to be a drunk as well as womanizer who is caught cheating with Clara's best friend. This drives Clara to alcoholism. To ensure a change of scenery, Anthony brings Clara to Murthy's town (a hill station like Agumbe); but obviously the change has not worked as Clara is revealed to be drinking even during the day.\n\nOne day, Murthy comes to Clara's place looking for Anthony and they have an argument about the merits of alcoholism. Clara has turned out to become a misogynist - Murthy tries to change her mind (\"Baaluvantha Hoove\"). At the end of the song Clara realizes she needs to give up alcohol.\n\nClara and Murthy seem to take a liking to each other, but Murthy also has a hard time forgetting his past. Seeing trains always makes him depressed. During one of their many walks, Murthy reveals to Clara about Indira, and Clara is even impressed that Murthy has found a way to cope with his loss.\n\nClara and Murthy decide to get married. They have a Hindu wedding and head to Agumbe for honeymoon in a brand new Contessa (\"Agumbe\"). Clara and Murthy stand at a view point waiting to watch the sunset when Murthy runs back to their car to fetch a flask of coffee. The wooden railings, against which Clara is leaning, give way and she falls down the rock-face to her death, leaving a hapless Murthy behind. Murthy trudges down the ravine himself hoping to rescue her but to no avail. Murthy awakens in a hospital, surrounded by his mother and friends. He is informed of Clara's demise and there is a cut to the opening graveyard scene. His friends turn up, hoping to cheer him up, but Murthy tells them that he is doing fine. Life's vicissitudes have only made him stronger.\n\n'''Act 3'''\n\nMurthy goes about his usual activities, specifically taking a harsh stance on offenses against women. He then makes his way to the Central Jail looking for a woman named Anandhi who has been in prison for three years. He is told that she is on her death bed in the hospital. At the hospital we learn that in her past life she was a madam at a brothel. Murthy would like her to aid his investigation and she insists that as quid pro quo Murthy should convince her estranged daughter Dr. Sarala who works in Mumbai to see her. Dr. Sarala is reluctant at first but is convinced by her husband to visit her ailing mother. Anandhi is overwhelmed to see her daughter but dies before Murthy can get any information from her, leaving Murthy with another dead end.\n\nLater Murthy receives a letter from Anandhi which mentions that while she doesn't know where they are, the names of her three associates are Vyasaraya, Tipparaju and Kaatayya. Murthy sets his men on their trail. He then collects some letters from the late Anandhi's belongings.\n\nMurthy's subordinates locate a man by the name Kaatesh who seems to have recently amassed a significant amount of wealth. Murthy calls Kaatesh under the false pretext of having recovered some stolen jewelry and vessels that belong to him. When Kaatesh denies having ever been burgled, Murthy convinces him to come to the police station to make a statement in writing. Having obtained a handwriting sample, he sends it off to be compared with the letters found among Anandhi's belongings. The comparison reveals that Kaatesh is indeed Kaatayya.\n\nMurthy then brings Kaatesh in, having taken Kaatesh's daughters into custody earlier for leverage. Under duress Kaatesh reveals that Tipparaju is dead but Vyasaraya lives in Hubli.\n\nMurthy heads to Hubli in search of Vyasaraya. He locates the house where Vyasaraya is running his prostitution racket. Murthy goes into the house disguised as an elderly Muslim man. He locates Vyasaraya's right-hand man and thrashes him into submission to reveal that Vysaraya left for Bangalore in that evening's train. Murthy follows the train and boards it in the next station.\n\nWhile searching for Vyasaraya, Murthy notices a girl running and being chased by a couple of goons on the platform. He gets off the train and gives them a chase. When he catches up with the girl, he realizes it is Indira. Indira tries to attack Murthy, thinking he is one of the Vysaraya's henchman. Upon realizing it is Murthy, she breaks down and reveals what happened after Vysaraya took her from the Travelers Bungalow in a brief flashback: Indira killed the man who tried to molest her and has been constantly on the run since.\n\nIn the present, Vyasaraya appears with his goons and sarcastically mentions that it has been his pleasure to snatch Indira from Murthy every time. A fight ensues and Murthy takes down the goons. Vyasaraya, trying to escape, gets trapped on a railway track between one of the cross wedges. Seeing an oncoming train, he panics and is unable to pull his leg out. Murthy tries to set him free, but Indira pulls him back seconds before the train hits Vyasaraya head-on and killing him instantly. With Vyasaraya dead, Indira heaves a sigh of relief.

He walks up to one of the graves and pays his respects. The police officer is revealed to be Murthy ([[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]]).\n\n'''Act 1'''\n\nMurthy is in a train compartment with Indira ([[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]]) and Vyasaraya ([[Vajramuni]]). Vyasaraya and Murthy start small talk about drama, music and stuff. Vyasaraya tells Murthy that he is taking Indira to a drama company. On goading from Vyasaraya, Murthy sings \"Anuragada.\" Indira takes an instant liking to Murthy. Meanwhile, Vyasaraya gets down the train to get some coffee, sees a man in a long coat and hides from him. He almost misses the train and luckily Murthy opens the door just in time to let Vyasaraya in. Vyasaraya tells Murthy that the man in the long coat is a pimp preying on unmarried girls like Indira. He asks Murthy to look after Indira until he returns and gets off the train.\n\nThe man (Inspector Rajagopal) in the long coat comes to Murthy and Indira and tells them Vyasaraya is actually the pimp and has made a living cheating innocent girls like Indira. Before Murthy can tell the cop about Vyasaraya he gets down the train and Vyasaraya reappears. This time he has a knife; Murthy fights Vyasaraya and tries to find Inspector Rajagopal but cannot find him. In panic, Indira gets off the train and so does Murthy. They try to find a place to stay the night in Traveler's Bungalow. Indira is impressed by Murthy's gentle behavior (\"Ee Kannigu Hennigu,\" a dream sequence song).\n\nIndira reveals to Murthy that Vyasaraya paid Rs.1000/- to her poor mother with the promise that he'll ensure that Indira joins a drama company. Indira asks Murthy to take her to her hometown of Navilukere near Sagar, as he wants to go back to her mom and two younger sisters. He agrees to take her to her hometown in the morning; unfortunately in the morning Vyasaraya and his henchmen attack Murthy who suffers a head injury. Vyasaraya elopes with Indira not to be seen anywhere.\n\nMurthy is devastated and reaches out to Inspector Rajagopal to find Indira but with no luck. On screen are Murthy's mom ([[Pandari Bai]]) and his friends Sundar Raj, Umesh and Mandeep Rai.\n\n'''Act 2'''\n\nMurthy is slowly trying to regain his life back after the Indira episode until he sees a drunk woman, Clara ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]), driving her Premier Padmini on railway tracks. Murthy, being the gentleman as ever, finds out that she's staying in Gulmohar suite and drives her home. There he meets Clara's brother Anthony who reveals why Clara started drinking in the first place - Clara is engaged to get married to Reggie ([[Avinash]]). Reggie is revealed to be a drunk as well as womanizer who is caught cheating with Clara's best friend. This drives Clara to alcoholism. To ensure a change of scenery, Anthony brings Clara to Murthy's town (a hill station like Agumbe); but obviously the change has not worked as Clara is revealed to be drinking even during the day.\n\nOne day, Murthy comes to Clara's place looking for Anthony and they have an argument about the merits of alcoholism. Clara has turned out to become a misogynist - Murthy tries to change her mind (\"Baaluvantha Hoove\"). At the end of the song Clara realizes she needs to give up alcohol.\n\nClara and Murthy seem to take a liking to each other, but Murthy also has a hard time forgetting his past. Seeing trains always makes him depressed. During one of their many walks, Murthy reveals to Clara about Indira, and Clara is even impressed that Murthy has found a way to cope with his loss.\n\nClara and Murthy decide to get married. They have a Hindu wedding and head to Agumbe for honeymoon in a brand new Contessa (\"Agumbe\"). Clara and Murthy stand at a view point waiting to watch the sunset when Murthy runs back to their car to fetch a flask of coffee. The wooden railings, against which Clara is leaning, give way and she falls down the rock-face to her death, leaving a hapless Murthy behind. Murthy trudges down the ravine himself hoping to rescue her but to no avail. Murthy awakens in a hospital, surrounded by his mother and friends. He is informed of Clara's demise and there is a cut to the opening graveyard scene. His friends turn up, hoping to cheer him up, but Murthy tells them that he is doing fine. Life's vicissitudes have only made him stronger.\n\n'''Act 3'''\n\nMurthy goes about his usual activities, specifically taking a harsh stance on offenses against women. He then makes his way to the Central Jail looking for a woman named Anandhi who has been in prison for three years. He is told that she is on her death bed in the hospital. At the hospital we learn that in her past life she was a madam at a brothel. Murthy would like her to aid his investigation and she insists that as quid pro quo Murthy should convince her estranged daughter Dr. Sarala who works in Mumbai to see her. Dr. Sarala is reluctant at first but is convinced by her husband to visit her ailing mother. Anandhi is overwhelmed to see her daughter but dies before Murthy can get any information from her, leaving Murthy with another dead end.\n\nLater Murthy receives a letter from Anandhi which mentions that while she doesn't know where they are, the names of her three associates are Vyasaraya, Tipparaju and Kaatayya. Murthy sets his men on their trail. He then collects some letters from the late Anandhi's belongings.\n\nMurthy's subordinates locate a man by the name Kaatesh who seems to have recently amassed a significant amount of wealth. Murthy calls Kaatesh under the false pretext of having recovered some stolen jewelry and vessels that belong to him. When Kaatesh denies having ever been burgled, Murthy convinces him to come to the police station to make a statement in writing. Having obtained a handwriting sample, he sends it off to be compared with the letters found among Anandhi's belongings. The comparison reveals that Kaatesh is indeed Kaatayya.\n\nMurthy then brings Kaatesh in, having taken Kaatesh's daughters into custody earlier for leverage. Under duress Kaatesh reveals that Tipparaju is dead but Vyasaraya lives in Hubli.\n\nMurthy heads to Hubli in search of Vyasaraya. He locates the house where Vyasaraya is running his prostitution racket. Murthy goes into the house disguised as an elderly Muslim man. He locates Vyasaraya's right-hand man and thrashes him into submission to reveal that Vysaraya left for Bangalore in that evening's train. Murthy follows the train and boards it in the next station.\n\nWhile searching for Vyasaraya, Murthy notices a girl running and being chased by a couple of goons on the platform. He gets off the train and gives them a chase. When he catches up with the girl, he realizes it is Indira. Indira tries to attack Murthy, thinking he is one of the Vysaraya's henchman. Upon realizing it is Murthy, she breaks down and reveals what happened after Vysaraya took her from the Travelers Bungalow in a brief flashback: Indira killed the man who tried to molest her and has been constantly on the run since.\n\nIn the present, Vyasaraya appears with his goons and sarcastically mentions that it has been his pleasure to snatch Indira from Murthy every time. A fight ensues and Murthy takes down the goons. Vyasaraya, trying to escape, gets trapped on a railway track between one of the cross wedges. Seeing an oncoming train, he panics and is unable to pull his leg out. Murthy tries to set him free, but Indira pulls him back seconds before the train hits Vyasaraya head-on and killing him instantly. With Vyasaraya dead, Indira heaves a sigh of relief. Murthy and Indira walk back into the darkness and the titles start rolling.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]] as Murthy(Narasimha Murthy)\n* [[Geetha (actress)|Geeta]] as Indira\n* [[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]] as Clara Murthy, Murthy's late wife\n* [[Vajramuni]] as Vyasraya, The Major Antagonist a Pimp who ruins the lives of women by forcefully sending them to brothel, Finally gets killed by train colission.\n* [[Thoogudeepa Srinivas]] as Katayya / Kaatesh who gets arrested and reveals the whereabouts of Vyasaraya, The main boss of the flesh trade gang.\n* [[K.

generations of the iPhone use Apple's [[iOS]] mobile operating system software. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.\n\nThe [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone has [[Wi-Fi]] and can connect to [[cellular network]]s. An iPhone can [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive [[email|emails]], [[web browser|browse the web]], send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]], record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive [[visual voicemail]]. [[video camera|Shooting video]] also became a standard feature with the [[iPhone 3GS]]. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading [[mobile app]]s. {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications available for the iPhone.\n\nApple has released thirteen [[Comparison of Apple iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the thirteen major releases of the [[iOS]] operating system. The [[IPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone and established design precedents, such as a placement of certain buttons that has persisted throughout all releases to date. The first iPhone also set a screen size that was maintained for the next four iterations. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] network support and was followed by the [[iPhone 3GS]] with improved hardware, the [[iPhone 4]] with a metal chassis, higher display resolution, and front-facing camera, and the [[iPhone 4S]] with improved hardware and the voice assistant [[Siri]]. The [[iPhone 5]] featured a taller, {{convert|4|in|mm}} display and Apple's newly introduced [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. In 2013, Apple released the [[iPhone 5S]] with improved hardware and a [[Touch ID|fingerprint reader]] (marketed as 'Touch ID'), and the lower-cost [[iPhone 5C]], a version of the 5 with a plastic body, instead of metal one. The 5C was also available in many colors. They were followed by the larger [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], with models featuring {{convert|4.7|and|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} displays. The [[iPhone 6S]] was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for [[3D Touch|pressure-sensitive touch inputs]], as well as the [[iPhone SE]]\u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus]], which add water resistance, improved system, and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack found on previous models. The [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The [[iPhone X]] was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera, and a new facial recognition system, named [[Face ID]], but having no home button, and therefore, no [[Touch ID]]. In September 2018, Apple released 3 new iPhones, which are the [[iPhone XS]], an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, [[iPhone XS Max]], a larger variant with the series' biggest display {{as of|2018|lc=y}} and [[iPhone XR]], a lower-end version of the iPhone X. On September 10, 2019, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are [[iPhone 11 Pro]], [[iPhone 11 Pro Max]], and the lower-end [[iPhone 11]]. \n\nThe first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market

Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.<ref>applications</ref> However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.\n\nThe original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iOS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iOS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduces Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.\n\nDocked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name=\"Update 1.1.3\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archivedate=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE|SE]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name=\"3.0 official\"/><ref name=\"3.0 Macworld\"/>\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Siracusa Frontier\">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple's Mousetrap\">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Phone===\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models.

On December 18, 2012, IGB launched its own line of Android smartphones under the tradename to which it has exclusive rights in the local market.<ref name=reuters-2012/> In February 2013, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office (known as \"Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial\") issued a ruling that Gradiente Eletr\u00f4nica, not Apple, owned the \"iPhone\" mark in Brazil. The \"iPhone\" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple's release of its first iPhone. This decision came three months after Gradiente Eletr\u00f4nica launched a lower-cost smartphone using the iPhone brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vergara del Carril|first=Marcos|title=Apple is Fighting Back in Brazilian Courts to Get its iPhone Trademark|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/apple-fighting-back-brazilian-courts-to-get-its-iphone-trademark|accessdate=November 6, 2013|newspaper=[[National Law Review]]|date=October 11, 2013|author2=Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, Apple won, for the second time, the right to use the brand name in Brazil.

Apple later filed a trademark case at the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) against Solid Broadband's MyPhone for \"confusingly similar\" to the iPhone and that it may likely \"deceive\" or \"cause confusion\" among consumers.\n\nApple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group in a 2015 decision made by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the \"iPhone\" and the \"MyPhone\". \"This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local 'Pinoy Phone' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark\",

generations of the iPhone use Apple's [[iOS]] mobile operating system software. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.\n\nThe [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone has [[Wi-Fi]] and can connect to [[cellular network]]s. An iPhone can [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive [[email|emails]], [[web browser|browse the web]], send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]], record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive [[visual voicemail]]. [[video camera|Shooting video]] also became a standard feature with the [[iPhone 3GS]]. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading [[mobile app]]s. {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications available for the iPhone.\n\nApple has released thirteen [[Comparison of Apple iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the thirteen major releases of the [[iOS]] operating system. The [[IPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] network support and was followed by the [[iPhone 3GS]] with improved hardware, the [[iPhone 4]] with a metal chassis, higher display resolution, and front-facing camera, and the [[iPhone 4S]] with improved hardware and the voice assistant [[Siri]]. The [[iPhone 5]] featured a taller, {{convert|4|in|mm}} display and Apple's newly introduced [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. In 2013, Apple released the [[iPhone 5S]] with improved hardware and a [[Touch ID|fingerprint reader]] (marketed as 'Touch ID'), and the lower-cost [[iPhone 5C]], a version of the 5 with a plastic body available in many colors instead of metal one. They were followed by the larger [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], with models featuring {{convert|4.7|and|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} displays. The [[iPhone 6S]] was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for [[3D Touch|pressure-sensitive touch inputs]], as well as the [[iPhone SE]]\u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus]], which add water resistance, improved system, and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack found on previous models. The [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The [[iPhone X]] was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera, and a new facial recognition system, named [[Face ID]], but having no home button, and therefore, no [[Touch ID]]. In September 2018, Apple released 3 new iPhones, which are the [[iPhone XS]], an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, [[iPhone XS Max]], a larger variant with the series' biggest display {{as of|2018|lc=y}} and [[iPhone XR]], a lower-end version of the iPhone X. On September 10, 2019, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are [[iPhone 11 Pro]], [[iPhone 11 Pro Max]], and the lower-end [[iPhone 11]]. \n\nThe first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|most valuable publicly traded companies]].\n\nAs of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.<ref name=\"Lifewire\"/>\n\n==History and

Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.\n\nThe original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iOS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iOS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduces Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.\n\nDocked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name=\"Update 1.1.3\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archivedate=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE|SE]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name=\"3.0 official\"/><ref name=\"3.0 Macworld\"/>\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Siracusa Frontier\">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple's Mousetrap\">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Phone===\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]\nThe iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out and fades back in when the call has ended.\n\nThe [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches.

The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.<ref>{{cite web|title=iOS 6 Preview|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multimedia===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]]. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\n\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name=\"Voice_Control\"/>\n\nThe iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 8, 2008 |title=What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.\n\nThe iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone.

The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera.

The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.\n\nAssistiveTouch helps to adapt the [[Multi-touch|Multi-Touch]] screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures, like rotate and shake, are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a [[wheelchair]].<ref name=\"Accessibility \u2013 iOS \u2013 Apple\"/>\n\nGuided Access helps people with [[autism]] or other [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention]] and [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory challenges]] stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.\n\nIn 2019 Apple began developing satellites so that the iPhone could skip wireless carriers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Axon |first1=Samuel |title=Report: Apple is developing satellites so the iPhone can skip wireless carriers |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/report-apple-is-developing-satellites-so-the-iphone-can-skip-wireless-carriers/?bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369 |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=26 December 2019 |language=en-us |date=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\n{{See also|List of iOS devices#iPhone}}\n24 different iPhone models have been produced.

Before leaving, she visits her mother, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. Upon arriving at the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident outside the house's gate and is a \"special case.\" Flora gives Kate a tour of the grounds and confesses that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to. \n\nThat night, Kate investigates a disturbance in the East Wing, which Flora refused to show her earlier. There, she encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, Kate receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. This startles Kate, who only becomes more aggravated with him when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her. She lashes out at Miles, but later apologizes. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died. \n\nKate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and proceeds to run out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. \n\nAfter reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. When Kate enquires about it, Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her increasingly paranoid. \n\nKate receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. She is led by wet footprints and Miss Jessel's ghost to discover Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house grounds. Kate also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate takes the children away in her car. \n\nThis previous sequence is revealed to have been a vision which Kate had as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles smirks at her, calling her delusional. Kate walks into her mother's mental institution and approaches a figure that appears to be her mother; as the figure turns around, Kate screams in horror. The face of the figure is not revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mackenzie Davis]] as Kate Mandell\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as Miles Fairchild\n* [[Brooklynn Prince]] as Flora Fairchild\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Darla Mandell<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/pete-davidson-judd-apatow-comedy-the-turning-universal-movie-opening-dates-1202547662/|title=Universal Dates Judd Apatow-Pete Davidson Comedy & DreamWorks' 'The Turning' For 2020|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=February 1, 2019|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref> \n* [[Barbara Marten]] as Mrs. Grose\n* [[Mark Huberman]] as Bert\n* Niall Greig Fulton as Peter Quint\n* Denna Thomsen as Miss Jessel\n* Kim Adis as Rose\n* Karen Egan as Nancy\n* Darlene Garr as Holly\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for [[Steven Spielberg]], who executive produced, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/juan-carlos-fresnadillo-haunted-dreamworks-horror-turn-of-the-screw-1201717460/|title=Juan Carlos Fresnadillo To Helm Ghost Tale 'Haunted' For DreamWorks|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=March 9, 2016|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first as ''Haunted'' with [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] attached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed as ''The Turning'', with [[Floria Sigismondi]].<ref name=Development>{{Cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dreamworks-shuts-down-ghost-story-931333|title=DreamWorks Shuts Down Ghost Story 'Haunted' Weeks Before Start Date (Exclusive)|last=Masters|first=Kim|date=September 21, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=Development2>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/floria-sigismondi-direct-the-turning-amblin-the-turn-of-the-screw-henry-james-1202155351/|title=Floria Sigismondi To Direct Henry James-Inspired 'The Turning' For Amblin|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=August 24, 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n====Fresnadillo project (2016)====\nOn March 9, 2016, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that [[Amblin Entertainment]] was hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titled ''Haunted'', which would be inspired by [[Henry James]]' 1898 [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] ghost story, ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

Before leaving, she visits her mother, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. Upon arriving at the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident outside the house's gate and is a \"special case.\" Flora gives Kate a tour of the grounds and confesses that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to. \n\nThat night, Kate investigates a disturbance in the East Wing, which Flora refused to show her earlier. There, she encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, Kate receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. This startles Kate, who only becomes more aggravated with him when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her. She lashes out at Miles, but later apologizes. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died. \n\nKate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and proceeds to run out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. \n\nAfter reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. When Kate enquires about it, Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her increasingly paranoid. \n\nKate receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. She is led by wet footprints and Miss Jessel's ghost to discover Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house grounds. Kate also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate takes the children away in her car. \n\nThis previous sequence is revealed to have been a vision which Kate had as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles smirks at her, calling her delusional. Kate walks into her mother's mental institution and approaches a figure that appears to be her mother; as the figure turns around, Kate screams in horror. The face of the figure is not revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mackenzie Davis]] as Kate Mandell\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as Miles Fairchild\n* [[Brooklynn Prince]] as Flora Fairchild\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Darla Mandell<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/pete-davidson-judd-apatow-comedy-the-turning-universal-movie-opening-dates-1202547662/|title=Universal Dates Judd Apatow-Pete Davidson Comedy & DreamWorks' 'The Turning' For 2020|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=February 1, 2019|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref> \n* [[Barbara Marten]] as Mrs. Grose\n* [[Mark Huberman]] as Bert\n* Niall Greig Fulton as Peter Quint\n* Denna Thomsen as Miss Jessel\n* Kim Adis as Rose\n* Karen Egan as Nancy\n* Darlene Garr as Holly\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for [[Steven Spielberg]], who executive produced, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/juan-carlos-fresnadillo-haunted-dreamworks-horror-turn-of-the-screw-1201717460/|title=Juan Carlos Fresnadillo To Helm Ghost Tale 'Haunted' For DreamWorks|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=March 9, 2016|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first as ''Haunted'' with [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] attached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed as ''The Turning'', with [[Floria Sigismondi]].<ref name=Development>{{Cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dreamworks-shuts-down-ghost-story-931333|title=DreamWorks Shuts Down Ghost Story 'Haunted' Weeks Before Start Date (Exclusive)|last=Masters|first=Kim|date=September 21, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=Development2>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/floria-sigismondi-direct-the-turning-amblin-the-turn-of-the-screw-henry-james-1202155351/|title=Floria Sigismondi To Direct Henry James-Inspired 'The Turning' For Amblin|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=August 24, 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n====Fresnadillo project (2016)====\nOn March 9, 2016, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that [[Amblin Entertainment]] was hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titled ''Haunted'', which would be inspired by [[Henry James]]' 1898 [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] ghost story, ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

From there it flows northeasterly to cross the Pennsylvania border just west of north [[Cheat Lake]] on its [[Cheat River]] tributary. Then it flows northerly across southwestern Pennsylvania, taking a bit of a detour northeast 10 miles south of Pittsburgh to approach Pittsburgh from the southeast and its confluence with the [[Allegheny River]] to form the [[Forks of the Ohio]] at \"The Point\" of [[Point State Park]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Geology==\nPrior to early Pleistocene regional glaciation, more than 780,000 years ago, the ancestral Monongahela River (a.k.a. the Pittsburgh River) flowed northward from present-day north-central West Virginia, across western [[Pennsylvania]] and northwestern Ohio, and into the [[Saint Lawrence River]] watershed. One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake\u2014known as [[Lake Monongahela]]\u2014stretching from an unknown point north of present-day [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] for ~{{convert|200|mi|km}} south to [[Weston, West Virginia]]. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to {{convert|1100|ft|m}} above sea level.

It falls 3,831&nbsp;ft. in elevation from its forks to its mouth on the Ohio River.  The mean depth is about 20&nbsp;ft.\n\nIn southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major [[tributary|tributaries]]: the [[Cheat River]], which joins at [[Point Marion, Pennsylvania|Point Marion]], and the [[Youghiogheny River]], which joins at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nMajor tributaries include: [[Becks Run]], [[Big Sandy Creek (Cheat River tributary)|Big Sandy Creek]], [[Buffalo Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Buffalo Creek]], [[Cheat River]], [[Crooked Run (Monongahela River tributary)|Crooked Run]], [[Deckers Creek]], [[Dunkard Creek]], [[Lick Run (Peters Creek tributary)|Lick Run]], [[Middle Fork River]], [[Paw Paw Creek]], [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]], [[Streets Run]], [[Turtle Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Turtle Creek]], [[Tygart Valley River]], [[West Fork River]], [[Youghiogheny River]].\n\n===Locks and dams===\n{{see also|List of dams and reservoirs in Pennsylvania}}\nThe river is navigable its entire length with a series of locks and dams that maintain a minimum depth of {{convert|9|ft|m|1}} to accommodate coal-laden barges.

Following the killing of several workers in the course of the strike, anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] wrote: \"Words had lost their meaning in the face of the innocent blood spilled on the banks of the Monongahela.\"\n\n===20th century===\nThree ships in the [[United States Navy]] have been named [[USS Monongahela|''Monongahela'']] after the river.\nIn October 1930, severe drought caused the river flow to drop below 10cfs, and in some places, it was possible to walk across the river bottom.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where this info comes from|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe river was the site of a [[List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft (1955\u20131959)#1956|famous airplane crash]] that has become the subject of numerous [[urban legend]]s and [[conspiracy theories]].

From there it flows northeasterly to cross the Pennsylvania border just west of north [[Cheat Lake]] on its [[Cheat River]] tributary. Then it flows northerly across southwestern Pennsylvania, taking a bit of a detour northeast 10 miles south of Pittsburgh to approach Pittsburgh from the southeast and its confluence with the [[Allegheny River]] to form the [[Forks of the Ohio]] at \"The Point\" of [[Point State Park]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Geology==\nPrior to early Pleistocene regional glaciation, more than 780,000 years ago, the ancestral Monongahela River (a.k.a. the Pittsburgh River) flowed northward from present-day north-central West Virginia, across western [[Pennsylvania]] and northwestern Ohio, and into the [[Saint Lawrence River]] watershed. One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake\u2014known as [[Lake Monongahela]]\u2014stretching from an unknown point north of present-day [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] for ~{{convert|200|mi|km}} south to [[Weston, West Virginia]]. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to {{convert|1100|ft|m}} above sea level. Over {{convert|200|ft|m}} deep in places, its southwestward overflow gradually incised old drainage divides and contributed to the geological development of the present-day upper [[Ohio River Valley]].<ref name=\"Garton2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Garton |first1=E.

It falls 3,831&nbsp;ft. in elevation from its forks to its mouth on the Ohio River.  The mean depth is about 20&nbsp;ft.\n\nIn southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major [[tributary|tributaries]]: the [[Cheat River]], which joins at [[Point Marion, Pennsylvania|Point Marion]], and the [[Youghiogheny River]], which joins at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nMajor tributaries include: [[Becks Run]], [[Big Sandy Creek (Cheat River tributary)|Big Sandy Creek]], [[Buffalo Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Buffalo Creek]], [[Cheat River]], [[Crooked Run (Monongahela River tributary)|Crooked Run]], [[Deckers Creek]], [[Dunkard Creek]], [[Lick Run (Peters Creek tributary)|Lick Run]], [[Middle Fork River]], [[Paw Paw Creek]], [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]], [[Streets Run]], [[Turtle Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Turtle Creek]], [[Tygart Valley River]], [[West Fork River]], [[Youghiogheny River]].\n\n===Locks and dams===\n{{see also|List of dams and reservoirs in Pennsylvania}}\nThe river is navigable its entire length with a series of locks and dams that maintain a minimum depth of {{convert|9|ft|m|1}} to accommodate coal-laden barges.

It resulted in a sharp defeat for two thousand [[British Empire|British]] and [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial]] forces against those of the [[France|French]] and their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies.\n\nIn 1817, the Pennsylvania legislature authorized the Monongahela Navigation Company to build 16 dams with bypass [[lock (water transport)|locks]] to create a river transportation system between Pittsburgh and the area that would later become West Virginia.<ref>[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&cc=ascead&rgn=main&view=text&didno=US-PPiU-dar193741 Monongahela Navigation Company Copybook], 1840-1897, DAR.1937.41, [[The Darlington Collection]], Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh</ref> Originally planned to run as far south as the Cheat River, the system was extended to Fairmont, and [[bituminous coal]] from West Virginia was the chief product transported downstream. After a [[Pennsylvania Canal Tunnel|canal tunnel through Grant's Hill]] in Pittsburgh was completed in 1832, boats could travel between the Monongahela River and the Western Division Canal of Pennsylvania's principal east-west canal and railroad system, the [[Main Line of Public Works]]. In 1897, the federal government took possession of the Monongahela Navigation through [[eminent domain|condemnation]] proceedings. Later, the dam-lock combinations were increased in size and reduced in number.<ref name=shank>{{cite book | last = Shank | first = William H. | title = The Amazing Pennsylvania Canals, 150th Anniversary Edition | publisher = American Canal and Transportation Center | year = 1986 | page = 76 | location = York, Pennsylvania | isbn=0-933788-37-1}}</ref>\n\nBriefly linked to the Monongahela Navigation was the Youghiogheny Navigation, a slack water system of {{convert|18.5|mi|km|1}} between McKeesport and [[West Newton, Pennsylvania|West Newton]]. It had two dam-locks overcoming a change in elevation of about {{convert|27|ft|m|}}. Opening in 1850, it was destroyed by a flood in 1865.<ref name=shank />\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Monongahela was heavily used by [[industry]], and several [[U.S. Steel]] plants, including the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]] Works, site of the [[Homestead Strike]] of 1892, were built along its banks. Following the killing of several workers in the course of the strike, anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] wrote: \"Words had lost their meaning in the face of the innocent blood spilled on the banks of the Monongahela.\"\n\n===20th century===\nThree ships in the [[United States Navy]] have been named [[USS Monongahela|''Monongahela'']] after the river.\nIn October 1930, severe drought caused the river flow to drop below 10cfs, and in some places, it was possible to walk across the river bottom.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where this info comes from|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe river was the site of a [[List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft (1955\u20131959)#1956|famous airplane crash]] that has become the subject of numerous [[urban legend]]s and [[conspiracy theories]]. Early in the morning of January 31, 1956, a [[B-25]] bomber en route from [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in [[Nevada]] to [[Olmsted Air Force Base]] in Pennsylvania crashed into the river near the [[Glenwood Bridge]] in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]].

It was directed by [[John Stephenson (director)|John Stephenson]], produced by Nick Hirschkorn, [[Lisa Henson]] and [[Samuel Hadida]], written by [[E. Nesbit]] and David Solomons with music by Jane Antonia Cornish and starring [[Tara FitzGerald]], [[Freddie Highmore]], [[Alex Jennings]], [[Jonathan Bailey (actor)|Jonathan Bailey]], Jessica Claridge, Poppy Rogers, Alec Muggleton, Zak Muggleton, [[Zo\u00eb Wanamaker]], [[Kenneth Branagh]], Alexander Pownall, [[Robert Tygner]], [[Eddie Izzard]] as the voice of It-Psammead, Georgio Serafini, [[John Sessions]], Kim Fenton, [[Norman Wisdom]] and [[Duncan Preston]]. The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 11 September 2004 and was theatrically released on 15 October 2004. The [[digital puppetry]] and CGI animation for Psammead was created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. ''Five Children and It'' grossed \u00a31,519,049 worldwide. The film was released on DVD on 5 July 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with five children (Robert, Cyril, Jane, Anthea and The Lamb), whose father has gone to fight in [[World War I]]. Consequently, the children must meanwhile stay at their aunt and eccentric uncle's house with his unpleasant son, Horace. While exploring the house, Robert finds a locked door in the forbidden greenhouse and brings the other children. They manage to open the door, which leads them through a secret path to the beach surrounding the house. There they discover a large shelled creature, which reveals itself as a \"psammead crustacean decapodlium wishasaurus,\" or sand fairy for short. The children, befuddled by this confusing name, refer to the creature simply as \"It.\" It seems rather mischievous and Cyril doubts whether the children should trust him, but upon confirming that It can grant wishes, the children wish for all the house chores on their list to be done by magic. When they return to the house, they see dozens of copies of themselves doing the chores and wrecking the house in the attempt.\n\nSuddenly, everything disappears in clouds of golden dust. They are then forced to tidy up the mess themselves. When they return to It and ask why their clones disappeared, It explains that at sunset, all wishes fade away. The children blame It for the mess, but It responds by saying that wishes bring valuable lessons.\n\nThe children need money to fix all the broken items, so they wish for buckets of gold and go off into town to buy some items. The children aren't able to buy anything because the owners will not accept gold, believing it is fake. They manage to purchase a car, having nothing else to do with the gold, and end up crashing it during a test drive. Mr. Peasemarsh, the owner, becomes furious and causes a scene with the children as the authorities and their aunt both appear on the scene. When Mr. Peasemarsh tries to reveal the children's \"stolen gold\", it vanishes just before he can show it to the officers, who take him away, believing he is out of his mind.\n\nHorace, meanwhile, is becoming suspicious of the children, and when they refuse to tell him what secret they're hiding, he manages to catch them in a room and locks it, telling them he won't let them out until they come clean. Robert, who was not with the rest when Horace trapped them, goes to It and wishes for wings so they can go off to [[France]] and find their father. The other children fly out the window when they discover their new wings, and Horace eventually decides to let them out only to discover them missing and the window open. While flying, the children are almost killed by heavy aircraft, but they just barely manage to escape danger. With sunset drawing near, they have no choice but to go home. During their return trip, their wings begin to fade, and it appears they will fall into the sea, but It's face appears among the clouds and blows on the children, sweeping them through the air back to shore.\n\nWhen the children's mother returns, the children learn that their father has gone missing. Robert talks to It that night, and falls asleep next to It on the beach. Horace, having followed Robert, captures It and brings him to his basement. The next morning, Robert confronts Horace but is unwilling to act, as Horace has his father's compass. Seeing that Horace plans to dissect It to find out how he works his magic, Robert suggests Horace wish for something instead. Interested in the idea, Horace wishes for his fossilized dinosaur egg to hatch. The children arrive in time to see Horace's dinosaur standing high above them and threatening to eat them. After trying to calm it down, It makes the dinosaur vanish. Shocked, Horace passes out, and Robert takes him to their mother, while the other children wish for their father to come home. He appears on the beach and talks to the children, but only minutes later he vanishes as sunset hits the beach. Robert, having just nearly missed returning to see him, is devastated.\n\nThe children go to Horace, and they talk about what happened in the basement. Horace, surprised at the secret, becomes agreeable, and the children settle their differences, and agree to share the secret of Its existence together. On It's birthday, the children wish It a good future and prepare to return home. When their car breaks down, they are forced to stay in the house and Horace suggests a game of hide-and-seek. As Robert counts, his father appears. When Robert realizes that its really their father, he and the children are overjoyed, joined by their mother. Finally reunited with their father, the children prepare to go home.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt.

She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Beilbacher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s fundamentalist Christian attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\" Using scorn is not the best word choice to display the dislike Parker has for his wife's views.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}
