They wanted to take the promotion in a different direction than others. \"Fat\" Frank and Angel took a group of misfit wrestlers who were not used in other promotion for various reasons and booked them in a show on that night under the promotion name.\n\nDuring 1997, only two shows were run, Northern States Wrestling Alliance a precursor to JAPW, the wrestlers were friends who were not getting booked in other wrestling shows due to the politics in the New Jersey wrestling scene at that time. Also featured wrestlers like A-Train, and Alexander the Great who are better known as [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]] respectively. Other wrestlers like Rockin' Rebel and [[James Maritato|Little Guido]] who moved on to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] as well as others became the foundation of the future of JAPW.\n\nDuring July 1997, \"Fat\" Frank searched for a venue to house the promotion. While looking for a venue, he met a local businessman by the name of Jeff Shapiro. Shapiro owned a local building called Charity Hall and was also a wrestling fan. Iadevaia and Shapiro agreed to a one-year lease of Charity Hall. On July 25, 1997, JAPW was born. During the early days of JAPW, they featured wrestlers who were established in the New Jersey independent wrestling scene looking for that big break. One of the first of the JAPW originals to take that opportunity and shine was [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] who made his debut on September 12, 1997. Also during the early days of JAPW, their shows were bloody and violent.  [[Hardcore wrestling]] during that time was due to the craze of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] and JAPW was seen as an alternative. Not long after, several ECW stars started making appearances in JAPW due to Iadevaia's friendship with former ECW star Jason. The Pitbulls, [[911 (wrestler)|911]], The Samoan Gangsta Party, and others made their debut for the promotion during 1997. Due to JAPW increasing popularity, it was considered the hottest ticket in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] at the time, and fans craved blood and violence like their ECW counterparts. On December 5, 1997, JAPW closed out their first year with ''Night of [[Barbed wire|Barb Wire]] #1''. It saw the Blood Angels defeat Homicide and Don Montoya to win the vacant [[JAPW Tag Team Championship]] in what is considered one of the most brutal and bloody matches in JAPW history.\n\n===1998===\nIn early 1998, JAPW flourished and attracted a larger fan base. Due to JAPW's continued growth, Jeff Shapiro saw the potential the promotion had and thus became an investor. Then on March 28, 1998, JAPW did something their critics and other New Jersey promoters never thought they would do: last a year and put on a their First Anniversary Show and Convention. The show and convention took place at the Sheraton Hotel in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. The convention had over 2,500 fans attend, and the live event had over 1,000 fans in attendance. This was the biggest at that time to ever hit the New Jersey independent wrestling scene. That show attracted some of biggest names in business including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[The Dudley Boyz]], [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], [[Paul Heyman]], [[The Wild Samoans]], [[Al Snow]], [[Shane Douglas]], and [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. Don Montoya, Reckless Youth, [[Russ Haas|Russ]] and [[Charlie Haas]] (the Haas Brothers), The Big Unit, [[Mike Bucci|Nova]], The Nation Of Immigration (Homicide & Kane \"D\"), Chino Martinez and The Sickness were the local homegrown in the show. After the JAPW First Anniversary Show, they showed they had the potential to be a major promotion thus putting the independent wrestling scene on notice.\n\nThe rest of 1998 included more growth for the young promotion. \"We guarantee excitement\" and \"blood is better\" quickly became two trademark slogans for the up-and-coming promotion.  Charity Hall continued to sell out crowds for each and every show JAPW put on there. Along with the sell out crowd, JAPW brought in top talent and showcased local undiscovered talent that became stars. Also during that time, the shows became increasingly more violent in nature with more blood and weapons. Death matches became commonplace in JAPW with every show featuring such weapons as [[barbed wire]], [[thumbtacks]], [[fire]], mouse traps, light tubes, and other weapons became standard. Glenn \"The Maniac\" Strange, \"Lightning\" Lou Diamond, Kane \"D\", Homicide, Jay Lover, and Low Life Louie led the way with their extreme, hardcore, and brutal style.\n\n===2000===\nJAPW peaked in popularity around 2000. With this increased popularity, JAPW was all over the news. The promotion was even featured in every major New Jersey newspaper and on major television stations.<ref name=historyofjapw/> On a national level JAPW was featured in [[The New York Times]],<ref name=historyofjapw/> ABC's [[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]],<ref name=historyofjapw/> and [[MSNBC]].<ref name=historyofjapw/> The newfound publicity helped the company flourish even more with record attendance numbers. But that also came with increasing scrutiny towards Bayonne mayor, New Jersey Senator [[Joseph Doria]], and New Jersey governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]]. While there were only a few complaints against the promotion, the politicians used this hardcore/extreme wrestling as an election ploy to keep their names in the press. During the spring of 2000, the City of Bayonne revoked JAPW's entertainment license, preventing the promotion from running events at Charity Hall. This forced JAPW to find a different venue to house their shows and alter their wrestling style. This was done to appease the local politicians who were now fully aware of Jersey All Pro Wrestling and their reputation. On September 18, 2000 New Jersey governor Whitman signed into law bill number A2304 banning extreme wrestling. This bill altered the face of JAPW. With the bill putting the promotion in a proverbial chokehold, the outlook for the future of the promotion seemed bleak. But in November 2000, ECW was facing bankruptcy, and JAPW had plans to put on a show called \"South Philly Invasion.\" JAPW was planning to go back to their roots, but once again politics from Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission put a quick stop to it and prevented the show from moving forward.\n\n===2001-2002===\nJAPW was allowed to return to Bayonne and Charity Hall but not without major changes. JAPW has to abide by strict Bayonne and New Jersey rules because it was under scrutiny from both the city and state. Plus, officials were sent to the shows to monitor the promotion. Thus ended the era \"Blood is Better\" on February 2, 2001. Frank Iadevaia, Jeff Shapiro, Pierre Pilger, and Angel Surita met with many of the promotions wrestlers to talk about the future of the promotion. If the company was going exist into the future, than change was crucial. So the company went into a new direction.  In effect of this change \"We are hard hitting\" became the new slogan and rally cry for JAPW. Many stars were influential during this new era, but the leaders of the new era were Da Hit Squad, Homicide, and [[Low Ki]]. JAPW once again showed their innovative style when they were the first independent promotion to showcase the [[shoot wrestling|strong style]] in the [[United States]] on a regular basis.\n\nIt was also during 2001, that [[Philadelphia]] joined Bayonne as stops during their monthly shows for the promotion. By the end of 2001, JAPW invaded [[Hackettstown, New Jersey|Hackettstown]]. During that year, many stars had breakout years, but it would be known as the breakout year for [[Da Hit Squad]] ([[Steve Mack|Monsta Mack]] and [[Dan Maff|Mafia]]), who were into their second reign as the [[JAPW Tag Team Championship|JAPW Tag Team Champions]]. \"Wall\" become a common chant for the Bayonne fans whenever Da Hit Squad were in action. They chanted \"wall, wall, wall...\" until Da Hit Squad [[Gorilla Press Slam]]med their opponents out of the ring and into the wall at Charity Hall. The Wall is said to be one of the most talked and devastating finishers in wrestling at that time. While a top force in the JAPW tag team division, Da Hit Squad also elevated other wrestlers into future stars with their ability to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Put over|put over]] other opponents. [[The Briscoe Brothers]], Dixie, Insane Dragon, Deranged, JT Jobber, and many others benefited from working with Da Hit Squad. Dixie and Insane Dragon were two local Bayonne brothers who got their starts the JAPW Wrestling School also had a breakout year. Dixie and Insane Dragon became fan favorites and underdogs while on their quest to capture the JAPW Tag Team Championship. On May 18, 2001, at ''Youth Gone Wild'', Dixie and Insane Dragon defeated Da Hit Squad to become the JAPW Tag Team Champions. Their reign only lasted 50 days as family drama slowly unfolded between the two brothers. During the feud, other family members get involved such as their father and younger sister.\n\nOn December 15, 2001, JAPW learned of [[Russ Haas]]'s passing, which affected all in the JAPW locker room. Then on February 2, 2002, JAPW presented the Russ Haas Memorial Show. Over 600 fans attended the memorial event while over 50 professional wrestlers from around the United States showed up and donated their salary for that evening.<ref Name=russhaas1>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Russ Haas Memorial Show results|publisher=HaasofPain.com|url=http://www.haasofpain.com/russ/memorial020202results_002.html|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> Even wrestlers from [[Florida]] flew up to the show as a show of respect for Haas to work the show. [[Charlie Haas|Charlie]] and the rest of the Haas family were also in attendance. The proceeds raised at the show went to the widow of Russ Haas. That night for the first time ever in JAPW history, a Triple Crown Champion was determined. The match was contested in a Triple Threat Match. [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship|JAPW Heavyweight Champion]] Homicide was challenged by [[JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship|JAPW Light Heavyweight Champion]] The Insane Dragon and [[JAPW New Jersey State Championship|JAPW New Jersey State Champion]] Dixie. Dixie won the match and became the Triple Crown Champion.\n\nJAPW was in talks to do business with [[California]] based [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] when XPW was making its East Coast debut in 2002.\n\nJAPW also made their debut in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey|Seaside Heights]] in 2002 with several shows during the summer. They ended the year back in Bayonne. In December 2002, JAPW learned the fate of their existence at Charity Hall. Jeff Shapiro sold Charity Hall to a developer, and the promotion was forced to look for another venue to house the shows. A short term was in place until JAPW found another venue to house the monthly shows.\n\n===Currently===\nJAPW held their events once a month in small venues such as the Rahway Rec Center, and the Golden Door Charter School in Jersey City. On May 22, 2010, Japanese legend [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] made his debut for JAPW, wrestling [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] in the main event of the show in which he lost. In the fall of 2010 JAPW started a working relationship with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), which saw Jushin Thunder Liger capturing the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship in December 2010.

They wanted to take the promotion in a different direction than others. \"Fat\" Frank and Angel took a group of misfit wrestlers who were not used in other promotion for various reasons and booked them in a show on that night under the promotion name.\n\nDuring 1997, only two shows were run, Northern States Wrestling Alliance a precursor to JAPW, the wrestlers were friends who were not getting booked in other wrestling shows due to the politics in the New Jersey wrestling scene at that time. Also featured wrestlers like A-Train, and Alexander the Great who are better known as [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]] respectively. Other wrestlers like Rockin' Rebel and [[James Maritato|Little Guido]] who moved on to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] as well as others became the foundation of the future of JAPW.\n\nDuring July 1997, \"Fat\" Frank searched for a venue to house the promotion. While looking for a venue, he met a local businessman by the name of Jeff Shapiro. Shapiro owned a local building called Charity Hall and was also a wrestling fan. Iadevaia and Shapiro agreed to a one-year lease of Charity Hall. On July 25, 1997, JAPW was born. During the early days of JAPW, they featured wrestlers who were established in the New Jersey independent wrestling scene looking for that big break. One of the first of the JAPW originals to take that opportunity and shine was [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] who made his debut on September 12, 1997. Also during the early days of JAPW, their shows were bloody and violent.  [[Hardcore wrestling]] during that time was due to the craze of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] and JAPW was seen as an alternative. Not long after, several ECW stars started making appearances in JAPW due to Iadevaia's friendship with former ECW star Jason. The Pitbulls, [[911 (wrestler)|911]], The Samoan Gangsta Party, and others made their debut for the promotion during 1997. Due to JAPW increasing popularity, it was considered the hottest ticket in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] at the time, and fans craved blood and violence like their ECW counterparts. On December 5, 1997, JAPW closed out their first year with ''Night of [[Barbed wire|Barb Wire]] #1''. It saw the Blood Angels defeat Homicide and Don Montoya to win the vacant [[JAPW Tag Team Championship]] in what is considered one of the most brutal and bloody matches in JAPW history.\n\n===1998===\nIn early 1998, JAPW flourished and attracted a larger fan base. Due to JAPW's continued growth, Jeff Shapiro saw the potential the promotion had and thus became an investor. Then on March 28, 1998, JAPW did something their critics and other New Jersey promoters never thought they would do: last a year and put on a their First Anniversary Show and Convention. The show and convention took place at the Sheraton Hotel in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. The convention had over 2,500 fans attend, and the live event had over 1,000 fans in attendance. This was the biggest at that time to ever hit the New Jersey independent wrestling scene. That show attracted some of biggest names in business including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[The Dudley Boyz]], [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], [[Paul Heyman]], [[The Wild Samoans]], [[Al Snow]], [[Shane Douglas]], and [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. Don Montoya, Reckless Youth, [[Russ Haas|Russ]] and [[Charlie Haas]] (the Haas Brothers), The Big Unit, [[Mike Bucci|Nova]], The Nation Of Immigration (Homicide & Kane \"D\"), Chino Martinez and The Sickness were the local homegrown in the show. After the JAPW First Anniversary Show, they showed they had the potential to be a major promotion thus putting the independent wrestling scene on notice.\n\nThe rest of 1998 included more growth for the young promotion. \"We guarantee excitement\" and \"blood is better\" quickly became two trademark slogans for the up-and-coming promotion.  Charity Hall continued to sell out crowds for each and every show JAPW put on there. Along with the sell out crowd, JAPW brought in top talent and showcased local undiscovered talent that became stars. Also during that time, the shows became increasingly more violent in nature with more blood and weapons. Death matches became commonplace in JAPW with every show featuring such weapons as [[barbed wire]], [[thumbtacks]], [[fire]], mouse traps, light tubes, and other weapons became standard. Glenn \"The Maniac\" Strange, \"Lightning\" Lou Diamond, Kane \"D\", Homicide, Jay Lover, and Low Life Louie led the way with their extreme, hardcore, and brutal style.\n\n===2000===\nJAPW peaked in popularity around 2000. With this increased popularity, JAPW was all over the news. The promotion was even featured in every major New Jersey newspaper and on major television stations.<ref name=historyofjapw/> On a national level JAPW was featured in [[The New York Times]],<ref name=historyofjapw/> ABC's [[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]],<ref name=historyofjapw/> and [[MSNBC]].<ref name=historyofjapw/> The newfound publicity helped the company flourish even more with record attendance numbers. But that also came with increasing scrutiny towards Bayonne mayor, New Jersey Senator [[Joseph Doria]], and New Jersey governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]]. While there were only a few complaints against the promotion, the politicians used this hardcore/extreme wrestling as an election ploy to keep their names in the press. During the spring of 2000, the City of Bayonne revoked JAPW's entertainment license, preventing the promotion from running events at Charity Hall. This forced JAPW to find a different venue to house their shows and alter their wrestling style. This was done to appease the local politicians who were now fully aware of Jersey All Pro Wrestling and their reputation. On September 18, 2000 New Jersey governor Whitman signed into law bill number A2304 banning extreme wrestling. This bill altered the face of JAPW. With the bill putting the promotion in a proverbial chokehold, the outlook for the future of the promotion seemed bleak. But in November 2000, ECW was facing bankruptcy, and JAPW had plans to put on a show called \"South Philly Invasion.\" JAPW was planning to go back to their roots, but once again politics from Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission put a quick stop to it and prevented the show from moving forward.\n\n===2001-2002===\nJAPW was allowed to return to Bayonne and Charity Hall but not without major changes. JAPW has to abide by strict Bayonne and New Jersey rules because it was under scrutiny from both the city and state. Plus, officials were sent to the shows to monitor the promotion. Thus ended the era \"Blood is Better\" on February 2, 2001. Frank Iadevaia, Jeff Shapiro, Pierre Pilger, and Angel Surita met with many of the promotions wrestlers to talk about the future of the promotion. If the company was going exist into the future, than change was crucial. So the company went into a new direction.  In effect of this change \"We are hard hitting\" became the new slogan and rally cry for JAPW. Many stars were influential during this new era, but the leaders of the new era were Da Hit Squad, Homicide, and [[Low Ki]]. JAPW once again showed their innovative style when they were the first independent promotion to showcase the [[shoot wrestling|strong style]] in the [[United States]] on a regular basis.\n\nIt was also during 2001, that [[Philadelphia]] joined Bayonne as stops during their monthly shows for the promotion. By the end of 2001, JAPW invaded [[Hackettstown, New Jersey|Hackettstown]]. During that year, many stars had breakout years, but it would be known as the breakout year for [[Da Hit Squad]] ([[Steve Mack|Monsta Mack]] and [[Dan Maff|Mafia]]), who were into their second reign as the [[JAPW Tag Team Championship|JAPW Tag Team Champions]]. \"Wall\" become a common chant for the Bayonne fans whenever Da Hit Squad were in action. They chanted \"wall, wall, wall...\" until Da Hit Squad [[Gorilla Press Slam]]med their opponents out of the ring and into the wall at Charity Hall. The Wall is said to be one of the most talked and devastating finishers in wrestling at that time. While a top force in the JAPW tag team division, Da Hit Squad also elevated other wrestlers into future stars with their ability to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Put over|put over]] other opponents. [[The Briscoe Brothers]], Dixie, Insane Dragon, Deranged, JT Jobber, and many others benefited from working with Da Hit Squad. Dixie and Insane Dragon were two local Bayonne brothers who got their starts the JAPW Wrestling School also had a breakout year. Dixie and Insane Dragon became fan favorites and underdogs while on their quest to capture the JAPW Tag Team Championship. On May 18, 2001, at ''Youth Gone Wild'', Dixie and Insane Dragon defeated Da Hit Squad to become the JAPW Tag Team Champions. Their reign only lasted 50 days as family drama slowly unfolded between the two brothers. During the feud, other family members get involved such as their father and younger sister.\n\nOn December 15, 2001, JAPW learned of [[Russ Haas]]'s passing, which affected all in the JAPW locker room. Then on February 2, 2002, JAPW presented the Russ Haas Memorial Show. Over 600 fans attended the memorial event while over 50 professional wrestlers from around the United States showed up and donated their salary for that evening.<ref Name=russhaas1>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Russ Haas Memorial Show results|publisher=HaasofPain.com|url=http://www.haasofpain.com/russ/memorial020202results_002.html|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> Even wrestlers from [[Florida]] flew up to the show as a show of respect for Haas to work the show. [[Charlie Haas|Charlie]] and the rest of the Haas family were also in attendance. The proceeds raised at the show went to the widow of Russ Haas. That night for the first time ever in JAPW history, a Triple Crown Champion was determined. The match was contested in a Triple Threat Match. [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship|JAPW Heavyweight Champion]] Homicide was challenged by [[JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship|JAPW Light Heavyweight Champion]] The Insane Dragon and [[JAPW New Jersey State Championship|JAPW New Jersey State Champion]] Dixie. Dixie won the match and became the Triple Crown Champion.\n\nJAPW was in talks to do business with [[California]] based [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] when XPW was making its East Coast debut in 2002.\n\nJAPW also made their debut in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey|Seaside Heights]] in 2002 with several shows during the summer. They ended the year back in Bayonne. In December 2002, JAPW learned the fate of their existence at Charity Hall. Jeff Shapiro sold Charity Hall to a developer, and the promotion was forced to look for another venue to house the shows. A short term was in place until JAPW found another venue to house the monthly shows.\n\n===Currently===\nJAPW held their events once a month in small venues such as the Rahway Rec Center, and the Golden Door Charter School in Jersey City.

The study confirms earlier research findings which identified the region as a hotspot for rising seas, with a potential to divert 3\u20134 times in the rate of rise, compared to the global average. The researchers attribute the possible increase to an ocean circulation mechanism called deep water formation, which is reduced due to AMOC slow down, leading to more warmer water pockets below the surface. Additionally, the study noted, \"Our results suggest that higher carbon emission rates also contribute to increased [sea level rise] in this region compared to the global average.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/01/why-the-u-s-east-coast-could-be-a-major-hotspot-for-sea-level-rise/|title=Why the U.S. East Coast could be a major 'hotspot' for rising seas|year=2016|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Shutdown===\n{{See also|Abrupt climate change}}\nGlobal warming could, via a shutdown of the [[thermohaline circulation]], trigger cooling in the North [[Atlantic]], Europe, and North America.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041219153611.htm Shutdown Of Circulation Pattern Could Be Disastrous, Researchers Say], 20 December 2004, ScienceDaily</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Possible Economic Impacts of a Shutdown of the Thermohaline Circulation: an Application of FUND|citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.5994}}</ref> This would particularly affect areas such as the [[British Isles]], [[France]] and the [[Nordic countries]], which are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wxfacts/North-Atlantic-Drift-Gulf-Stream.htm|title=Weather Facts: North Atlantic Drift (Gulf Stream) - Weather UK - weatheronline.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/north-atlantic-drift.html|title=The North Atlantic Drift Current}}</ref> Major consequences, apart from regional cooling, could also include an increase in major floods and storms, a collapse of [[plankton]] stocks, warming or rainfall changes in the tropics or [[Alaska]] and [[Antarctica]], more frequent and intense [[El Ni\u00f1o]] events due to associated shutdowns of the [[Kuroshio Current|Kuroshio]], [[Leeuwin Current|Leeuwin]], and [[East Australian Current]]s that are connected to the same thermohaline circulation as the Gulf Stream, or an [[oceanic anoxic event]] \u2014 [[oxygen|oxygen ({{chem|O|2}})]] below surface levels of the stagnant oceans becomes completely depleted \u2013 a probable cause of past [[Extinction event|mass extinction events]].<ref name=Schiermeier2007 />\n\n==Effects on weather==\nHansen et al. 2015 found, that the shutdown or substantial slowdown of the AMOC, besides possibly contributing to extreme end-[[Eemian]] events, will cause a more general increase of severe weather. Additional surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower tropospheric temperature gradients, and causes in model simulations a large increase of mid-latitude [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] energy throughout the midlatitude troposphere. This in turn leads to an increase of [[baroclinicity]] produced by stronger temperature gradients, which provides energy for more severe weather events.\n\nMany of the most memorable and devastating storms in eastern North America and western Europe, popularly known as superstorms, have been winter cyclonic storms, though sometimes occurring in late fall or early spring, that generate near-hurricane-force winds and often large amounts of snowfall. Continued warming of low latitude oceans in coming decades will provide more water vapor to strengthen such storms. If this tropical warming is combined with a cooler North Atlantic Ocean from AMOC slowdown and an increase in midlatitude eddy energy, we can anticipate more severe baroclinic storms.\n\nHansen et al. results at least imply that strong cooling in the North Atlantic from AMOC shutdown does create higher wind speed. The increment in seasonal mean wind speed of the northeasterlies relative to preindustrial conditions is as much as 10\u201320%. Such a percentage increase of wind speed in a storm translates into an increase of storm power dissipation by a factor \u223c1.4\u20132, because wind power dissipation is proportional to the cube of wind speed. However, the simulated changes refer to seasonal mean winds averaged over large grid-boxes, not individual storms.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2015-432/|title=Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2&nbsp;\u00b0C global warming is highly dangerous|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions|volume=15|issue=14|pages=20059\u201320179|year=2015|author=J.

Source: [[NASA]].]]\n\nHeat is transported from the equator [[Geographical pole|polewards]] mostly by the [[atmosphere]] but also by [[ocean current]]s, with warm water near the surface and cold water at deeper levels. The best known segment of this circulation is the Gulf Stream, a wind-driven [[Ocean gyre|gyre]], which transports warm water from the [[Caribbean]] northwards. A northwards branch of the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Drift, is part of the [[thermohaline circulation]] (THC), transporting warmth further north to the North Atlantic, where its effect in warming the atmosphere contributes to warming Europe.\n\nThe [[evaporation]] of ocean water in the North Atlantic increases the [[salinity]] of the water as well as cooling it, both actions increasing the density of water at the surface. Formation of [[sea ice]] further increases the salinity and density, because salt is ejected into the ocean when sea ice forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/characteristics/brine_salinity.html|title=Salinity and Brine|publisher=NSIDC}}</ref> This dense water then sinks and the circulation stream continues in a southerly direction. However, the [[Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation]] (AMOC) is driven by ocean temperature and salinity differences. But freshwater decreases ocean water salinity, and through this process prevents colder waters sinking. This mechanism possibly caused the cold ocean surface temperature anomaly currently observed near Greenland ([[Cold blob (North Atlantic)]]).<ref name=WP2015Sep>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cold-blob-in-the-north-atlantic-ocean/|title=Everything you need to know about the surprisingly cold 'blob' in the North Atlantic ocean|year=2015|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nGlobal warming could lead to an increase in [[freshwater]] in the northern oceans, by melting [[glacier]]s in [[Greenland]], and by increasing [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], especially through Siberian rivers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gierz|first1=Paul|title=Response of Atlantic Overturning to future warming in a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet model|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=42|issue=16|pages=6811\u20136818|date=31 August 2015|doi=10.1002/2015GL065276|bibcode = 2015GeoRL..42.6811G |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>Turrell, B.

The study confirms earlier research findings which identified the region as a hotspot for rising seas, with a potential to divert 3\u20134 times in the rate of rise, compared to the global average. The researchers attribute the possible increase to an ocean circulation mechanism called deep water formation, which is reduced due to AMOC slow down, leading to more warmer water pockets below the surface. Additionally, the study noted, \"Our results suggest that higher carbon emission rates also contribute to increased [sea level rise] in this region compared to the global average.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/01/why-the-u-s-east-coast-could-be-a-major-hotspot-for-sea-level-rise/|title=Why the U.S. East Coast could be a major 'hotspot' for rising seas|year=2016|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Shutdown===\n{{See also|Abrupt climate change}}\nGlobal warming could, via a shutdown of the [[thermohaline circulation]], trigger cooling in the North [[Atlantic]], Europe, and North America.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041219153611.htm Shutdown Of Circulation Pattern Could Be Disastrous, Researchers Say], 20 December 2004, ScienceDaily</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Possible Economic Impacts of a Shutdown of the Thermohaline Circulation: an Application of FUND|citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.5994}}</ref> This would particularly affect areas such as the [[British Isles]], [[France]] and the [[Nordic countries]], which are warmed by the [[North Atlantic drift]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wxfacts/North-Atlantic-Drift-Gulf-Stream.htm|title=Weather Facts: North Atlantic Drift (Gulf Stream) - Weather UK - weatheronline.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/north-atlantic-drift.html|title=The North Atlantic Drift Current}}</ref> Major consequences, apart from regional cooling, could also include an increase in major floods and storms, a collapse of [[plankton]] stocks, warming or rainfall changes in the tropics or [[Alaska]] and [[Antarctica]], more frequent and intense [[El Ni\u00f1o]] events due to associated shutdowns of the [[Kuroshio Current|Kuroshio]], [[Leeuwin Current|Leeuwin]], and [[East Australian Current]]s that are connected to the same thermohaline circulation as the Gulf Stream, or an [[oceanic anoxic event]] \u2014 [[oxygen|oxygen ({{chem|O|2}})]] below surface levels of the stagnant oceans becomes completely depleted \u2013 a probable cause of past [[Extinction event|mass extinction events]].<ref name=Schiermeier2007 />\n\n==Effects on weather==\nHansen et al. 2015 found, that the shutdown or substantial slowdown of the AMOC, besides possibly contributing to extreme end-[[Eemian]] events, will cause a more general increase of severe weather. Additional surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower tropospheric temperature gradients, and causes in model simulations a large increase of mid-latitude [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] energy throughout the midlatitude troposphere. This in turn leads to an increase of [[baroclinicity]] produced by stronger temperature gradients, which provides energy for more severe weather events.\n\nMany of the most memorable and devastating storms in eastern North America and western Europe, popularly known as superstorms, have been winter cyclonic storms, though sometimes occurring in late fall or early spring, that generate near-hurricane-force winds and often large amounts of snowfall. Continued warming of low latitude oceans in coming decades will provide more water vapor to strengthen such storms. If this tropical warming is combined with a cooler North Atlantic Ocean from AMOC slowdown and an increase in midlatitude eddy energy, we can anticipate more severe baroclinic storms.\n\nHansen et al. results at least imply that strong cooling in the North Atlantic from AMOC shutdown does create higher wind speed. The increment in seasonal mean wind speed of the northeasterlies relative to preindustrial conditions is as much as 10\u201320%. Such a percentage increase of wind speed in a storm translates into an increase of storm power dissipation by a factor \u223c1.4\u20132, because wind power dissipation is proportional to the cube of wind speed. However, the simulated changes refer to seasonal mean winds averaged over large grid-boxes, not individual storms.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2015-432/|title=Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2&nbsp;\u00b0C global warming is highly dangerous|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions|volume=15|issue=14|pages=20059\u201320179|year=2015|author=J.

Source: [[NASA]].]]\n\nHeat is transported from the equator [[Geographical pole|polewards]] mostly by the [[atmosphere]] but also by [[ocean current]]s, with warm water near the surface and cold water at deeper levels. The best known segment of this circulation is the Gulf Stream, a wind-driven [[Ocean gyre|gyre]], which transports warm water from the [[Caribbean]] northwards. A northwards branch of the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Drift, is part of the [[thermohaline circulation]] (THC), transporting warmth further north to the North Atlantic, where its effect in warming the atmosphere contributes to warming Europe.\n\nThe [[evaporation]] of ocean water in the North Atlantic increases the [[salinity]] of the water as well as cooling it, both actions increasing the density of water at the surface. Formation of [[sea ice]] further increases the salinity and density, because salt is ejected into the ocean when sea ice forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/characteristics/brine_salinity.html|title=Salinity and Brine|publisher=NSIDC}}</ref> This dense water then sinks and the circulation stream continues in a southerly direction. However, the [[Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation]] (AMOC) is driven by ocean temperature and salinity differences. But freshwater decreases ocean water salinity, and through this process prevents colder waters sinking. This mechanism possibly caused the cold ocean surface temperature anomaly currently observed near Greenland ([[Cold blob (North Atlantic)]]).<ref name=WP2015Sep>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cold-blob-in-the-north-atlantic-ocean/|title=Everything you need to know about the surprisingly cold 'blob' in the North Atlantic ocean|year=2015|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nGlobal warming could lead to an increase in [[freshwater]] in the northern oceans, by melting [[glacier]]s in [[Greenland]], and by increasing [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], especially through Siberian rivers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gierz|first1=Paul|title=Response of Atlantic Overturning to future warming in a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet model|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=42|issue=16|pages=6811\u20136818|date=31 August 2015|doi=10.1002/2015GL065276|bibcode = 2015GeoRL..42.6811G |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>Turrell, B.

Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival.

Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong finally realized his real idea and was moved.

Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong remaineded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she uesd her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong finally realized his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between humans and spirits. Until this moment, Honghong expressed her love to Yuechu and Yuechu got his magic item, Xukong Zhilei(\u865a\u7a7a\u4e4b\u6cea, means the tears of void) because of his guilt. The Queen really wanted to get it, she seriously hurt Yuechu. But the magic item had been become Yuechu and Honghong's magic item of love continuation in their heart. The Queen couldn't kill them if she wanted the complete item. Honghong started the love continuation, making a wish that meet each other in next life. Dongfang Yuechu was dead and Tushan Honghong lost her spirit power and memory, become Tushan Susu.\n\nIn Tushan Theater, people knew what happened 500 years ago in Bai Yuechu's reincarnation and Tushan Susu. But Tushan was attacked by black fox spirits, Beishan Yaodi(real name is Shi Kuan(\u77f3\u5bbd)) and Tushan Meimei(\u6d82\u5c71\u7f8e\u7f8e, a member of black fox spirits). Tushan Susu became Honghong temporarily but was controlled by Meimei. To save her, Bai and Rongrong came into her dream and finally saw Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu's soul. Susu became back. With the help of Bai and Susu's help, Shi Kuan was back to normal and accepted a girl whose reincarnation was the Princess of Yuyao Guo(\u5fa1\u5996\u56fd) and Shi was her lover in their former life.\n\nAll of spirits in Tushan and people in Yiqi Taoist League wanted Tushan Honghong could really be back, so Tushan Yaya asked Bai to marry Susu.

Sandford|''Dred Scott'' case]].\n\nThe national park consists of the Gateway Arch, a steel [[catenary arch]] that has become the definitive icon of St. Louis; a {{convert|91|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of the city; the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis)|Old Courthouse]], a former state and federal courthouse where the ''Dred Scott'' case originated; and the {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[#Museum at the Gateway Arch|museum at the Gateway Arch]].\n\n==Components==\n\n===The Gateway Arch===\n{{main|Gateway Arch}}\n[[Image:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gateway Arch]]]]\n\nThe '''Gateway Arch''', known as the \"Gateway to the West\", is the tallest structure in Missouri. It was designed by [[Finnish American|Finnish-American]] architect [[Eero Saarinen]] and structural engineer [[Hannskarl Bandel]] in 1947 and built between 1963 and October 1965.   It stands {{convert|630|ft|m|0|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|630|ft|m|0|sp=us}} wide at its base.  The legs are {{convert|54|ft|m|1|sp=us}} wide at the base, narrowing to {{convert|17|ft|m|1|sp=us}} at the arch.  There is a unique tram system to carry passengers to the observation room at the top of the arch.\n\n===Old Courthouse===\n{{main|Old Courthouse (St. Louis)}}\nThe '''Old Courthouse''' is built on land originally deeded by St. Louis founder [[Auguste Chouteau]]. It marks the location over which the arch reaches. Its dome was built during the [[American Civil War]] and is similar to the dome on the [[United States Capitol]] which was also built during the Civil War.  It was the site of the local trials in the [[Dred Scott]] case.\n\nThe courthouse is the only portion of the memorial west of [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|Interstate 44]]. To the west of the Old Courthouse is a [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]] between Market and Chestnut Streets which is only interrupted by the [[Civil Courts Building]] which features a pyramid model of the [[Mausoleum of Mausolus]] (which was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) on its roof. When the Civil Courts building was built in the 1920s, the Chouteau family sued to regain the property belonging to the Old Courthouse because it had been deeded in perpetuity to be a courthouse.\n\n===Museum at the Gateway Arch===\nUnderneath the arch is a visitor center, entered from a circular entryway facing the Old Courthouse. Within the center, a project to rebuild the Museum at the Gateway Arch was completed in July 2018. The new museum features exhibits on a variety of topics including westward expansion and the construction of the arch, all told through a St. Louis lens. Tucker Theater, finished in 1968 and renovated 30 years later, has about 285 seats and shows a documentary (''[[Monument to the Dream]]'') on the arch's construction. A second theater was added in 1993 but removed in 2018 as part of the CityArchRiver renovation project. Also located in the visitor center are a gift shop and cafe.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:STL Old courthouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]] from the observation area at the top of the arch]]\n\n===1930s===\nThe memorial was developed largely through the efforts of St. Louis civic booster [[Luther Ely Smith]] who first pitched the idea in 1933, was the long-term chairman of the committee that selected the area and persuaded [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1935 to make it a national park service unit after St. Louis passed a bond issue to begin building it, and who partially financed the 1947 architectural contest that selected the arch.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/upload/luther_ely_smith.pdf |format= PDF |title= Luther Ely Smith: Founder of a Memorial |work= The Museum Gazette |publisher= National Park Service |accessdate= January 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1930s the United States began looking for a suitable memorial for [[Thomas Jefferson]] (the [[Washington Monument]] and the newly built [[Lincoln Memorial]] were the only large Presidential memorials at the time).\n\nShortly after [[Thanksgiving]] in 1933 Smith who had been on the commission to build the [[George Rogers Clark National Historical Park]] in Indiana, was returning via train when he noticed the poor condition of the original [[plat]]ted location of St. Louis along the Mississippi. He thought that the memorial to Jefferson should be on the actual location that was symbolic of one of Jefferson's greatest triumphs\u2014the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n\nThe originally platted area of St. Louis was the site of:\n*The [[Battle of Saint Louis]], the only battle west of the Mississippi River in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n*The first capital of Upper Louisiana for the United States, the [[Louisiana Purchase]] north of the [[33rd parallel north|33rd parallel]] that was the original [[Louisiana Territory]] in 1803.\n*The [[Three Flags Day]] ceremony in 1804 in which Spain formally turned over Louisiana to France, less than 24 hours before France then officially turned it over to the United States. This technically completed the Louisiana Purchase, and also cleared the way for [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] to legally begin their [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|exploration]] of the continental west, which Spain had prohibited.\n\nAlmost all of the historic buildings associated with this period had been replaced by newer buildings.  His idea was to raze all of the buildings in the original St. Louis platted area and replace it with a park with \"a central feature, a shaft, a building, an arch, or something which would symbolize American culture and civilization.\"\n\nSmith pitched the idea to [[Bernard Dickmann]] who quickly assembled a meeting of St. Louis civic leaders on December 15, 1933 at the Jefferson Hotel and they endorsed the plan and Smith became chairman of what would become the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (a position he would hold until 1949 with a one-year exception).\n\nThe Commission then defined the area, got cost estimates of $30 million to buy the land, clear the buildings and erect a park and monument.  With promises from the federal government (via the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission) to join if the City of St. Louis could raise money.\n\nThe area to be included in the park was bounded by the [[Eads Bridge]]/Washington Avenue on the north and Poplar Street on the south, the Mississippi River on the east and Third Street (now [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|Interstate 44]]) on the west.  The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], just west of Third Street, was added in 1940.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O\u2019Neil|first1=Tim|title=With cornice repairs complete, scaffold around St. Louis' Old Courthouse coming down|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/with-cornice-repairs-complete-scaffold-around-st-louis-old-courthouse/article_2930a6da-79a0-5f39-9f80-102cacb5d64e.html|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe only building in this area not included was the [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France|Old Cathedral]], which is on the site of St. Louis first church and was opposite the home of St. Louis founder [[Auguste Chouteau]].

Interest in the monument was fed after the war as it was to be the first big monument in the post-World War II era.\n\nThe estimated cost of the competition was $225,000 and Smith personally donated $40,000.  Civic leaders held the nationwide competition in 1947 to select a design for the main portion of the Memorial space.\n\nArchitect [[Eero Saarinen]] won this competition with plans for a {{convert|590|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[catenary]] arch to be placed on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]]. However, these plans were modified over the next 15 years, placing the arch on higher ground and adding {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} in height and width.\n\nThe central architectural feature at the base of the arch is the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], which was once the tallest building in Missouri and has a dome similar to the [[United States Capitol]] and was placed on the building during the [[American Civil War]] at the same time as that on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSaarinen developed the shape with the help of architectural engineer [[Hannskarl Bandel]]. It is not a pure inverted [[catenary]]. Saarinen preferred a shape that was slightly elongated and thinner towards the top, a shape that produces a subtle soaring effect, and transfers more of the structure's weight downward rather than outward at the base.\n\nWhen Saarinen won the competition, the official notification was sent to \"E. Saarinen\", thinking it to be the architect's father [[Eliel Saarinen]], who had also submitted an entry. The family celebrated with a bottle of champagne, and two hours later an embarrassed official called to say the winner was, in fact, the younger Saarinen. The elder Saarinen then broke out a second bottle of champagne to celebrate his son's success.\n\nAmong the five finalists was local St. Louis architect [[Harris Armstrong]].\n\n===1950s===\nLand for the memorial was formally dedicated on June 10, 1950 by [[Harry S. Truman]].  However the [[Korean War]] began and the project was put on hold.\n\nOn June 23, 1959, work begins on covering railroad tracks that cut across the memorial grounds.\n\n===1960s===\nOn February 11, 1961, excavation began, and that September 1, Saarinen died. On February 12, 1963, the first stainless steel triangle that formed the first section of the arch was set in place on the south leg.\n\nOn October 28, 1965, it was completed, costing approximately $15 million to build. The adjacent park was designed by landscape architect [[Dan Kiley]]. Along with all other historical areas of the National Park Service, the memorial was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] dedicated the arch on May 25, 1968.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1984, Congress authorized the enlargement of the Memorial to include up to {{convert|100|acre|ha}} on the east bank of the Mississippi River in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. Funds were authorized to begin land acquisition, but Congress placed a moratorium upon NPS land acquisitions in fiscal year 1998. The moratorium continued into the 21st century, with expansion becoming less likely because of the construction of a [[Riverboat casino|riverboat gambling facility]] and related amenities.\n\n===1990s===\nDuring the [[Great Flood of 1993]], Mississippi flood waters reached halfway up the Grand Staircase on the east.\n\nIn 1999, the arch tram queue areas were renovated at a cost of about $2.2 million. As well, the [[Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site]] in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]], was put under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the Memorial.\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Missouri quarter, reverse side, 2003.jpg|thumb|The Missouri state quarter depicting the Gateway Arch and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]]]\nThe arch was featured on the Missouri state quarter in 2003.\n\nIn 2007 St. Louis Mayor [[Francis Slay]] and former Missouri Senator [[John Danforth]] asked the National Park Service to create a more \"active\" use of the grounds of the memorial and model it on [[Millennium Park]] in [[Chicago]] including the possibility of restaurants, fountains, ice skating, swimming, and other activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1250042.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628124857/http://www.semissourian.com/story/1250042.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2018 |title=St. Louis hopes to obtain part of Arch grounds | last=Salter |first=Jim |work=[[Southeast Missourian]] |date=August 29, 2007 |access-date=April 20, 2017}}</ref> The National Park Service was not in favor of the plan noting that the only other overt development pressure on national park property has been at the [[Jackson Hole Airport]] in [[Grand Teton National Park]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/10DA9EE598C17FAD86257345007A63F0?OpenDocument |title= City Leaders Pitch Local Control of Arch Grounds |work= St. Louis Post Dispatch |date= August 29, 2007 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131214652/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/10DA9EE598C17FAD86257345007A63F0?OpenDocument |archivedate= January 31, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nFor most of its life, the Memorial was largely separated from the rest of [[Downtown St. Louis]] by a sunken section of [[I-70]] (now I-44 with the rerouting of I-70 over a new bridge), but in 2014, a lid was installed over the highway, creating the foundation for a park connecting downtown with the Memorial grounds.

The [[Gateway Arch]] and its immediate surroundings were initially designated as a [[List of National Memorials of the United States|national memorial]] by [[executive order]] on December 21, 1935, and redesignated as a national park in 2018. The park is maintained by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS).\n\nThe memorial was established to commemorate:\n*the [[Louisiana Purchase]], and the subsequent westward movement of American explorers and pioneers;\n*the first civil government west of the [[Mississippi River]]; and\n*the debate over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] raised by the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' case]].\n\nThe national park consists of the Gateway Arch, a steel [[catenary arch]] that has become the definitive icon of St. Louis; a {{convert|91|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of the city; the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis)|Old Courthouse]], a former state and federal courthouse where the ''Dred Scott'' case originated; and the {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[#Museum at the Gateway Arch|museum at the Gateway Arch]].\n\n==Components==\n\n===The Gateway Arch===\n{{main|Gateway Arch}}\n[[Image:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gateway Arch]]]]\n\nThe '''Gateway Arch''', known as the \"Gateway to the West\", is the tallest structure in Missouri. It was designed by [[Finnish American|Finnish-American]] architect [[Eero Saarinen]] and structural engineer [[Hannskarl Bandel]] in 1947 and built between 1963 and October 1965.   It stands {{convert|630|ft|m|0|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|630|ft|m|0|sp=us}} wide at its base.  The legs are {{convert|54|ft|m|1|sp=us}} wide at the base, narrowing to {{convert|17|ft|m|1|sp=us}} at the arch.  There is a unique tram system to carry passengers to the observation room at the top of the arch.\n\n===Old Courthouse===\n{{main|Old Courthouse (St. Louis)}}\nThe '''Old Courthouse''' is built on land originally deeded by St. Louis founder [[Auguste Chouteau]]. It marks the location over which the arch reaches. Its dome was built during the [[American Civil War]] and is similar to the dome on the [[United States Capitol]] which was also built during the Civil War.  It was the site of the local trials in the [[Dred Scott]] case.\n\nThe courthouse is the only portion of the memorial west of [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|Interstate 44]]. To the west of the Old Courthouse is a [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]] between Market and Chestnut Streets which is only interrupted by the [[Civil Courts Building]] which features a pyramid model of the [[Mausoleum of Mausolus]] (which was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) on its roof. When the Civil Courts building was built in the 1920s, the Chouteau family sued to regain the property belonging to the Old Courthouse because it had been deeded in perpetuity to be a courthouse.\n\n===Museum at the Gateway Arch===\nUnderneath the arch is a visitor center, entered from a circular entryway facing the Old Courthouse. Within the center, a project to rebuild the Museum at the Gateway Arch was completed in July 2018. The new museum features exhibits on a variety of topics including westward expansion and the construction of the arch, all told through a St. Louis lens. Tucker Theater, finished in 1968 and renovated 30 years later, has about 285 seats and shows a documentary (''[[Monument to the Dream]]'') on the arch's construction. A second theater was added in 1993 but removed in 2018 as part of the CityArchRiver renovation project. Also located in the visitor center are a gift shop and cafe.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:STL Old courthouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]] from the observation area at the top of the arch]]\n\n===1930s===\nThe memorial was developed largely through the efforts of St. Louis civic booster [[Luther Ely Smith]] who first pitched the idea in 1933, was the long-term chairman of the committee that selected the area and persuaded [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1935 to make it a national park service unit after St. Louis passed a bond issue to begin building it, and who partially financed the 1947 architectural contest that selected the arch.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/upload/luther_ely_smith.pdf |format= PDF |title= Luther Ely Smith: Founder of a Memorial |work= The Museum Gazette |publisher= National Park Service |accessdate= January 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1930s the United States began looking for a suitable memorial for [[Thomas Jefferson]] (the [[Washington Monument]] and the newly built [[Lincoln Memorial]] were the only large Presidential memorials at the time).\n\nShortly after [[Thanksgiving]] in 1933 Smith who had been on the commission to build the [[George Rogers Clark National Historical Park]] in Indiana, was returning via train when he noticed the poor condition of the original [[plat]]ted location of St. Louis along the Mississippi. He thought that the memorial to Jefferson should be on the actual location that was symbolic of one of Jefferson's greatest triumphs\u2014the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n\nThe originally platted area of St. Louis was the site of:\n*The [[Battle of Saint Louis]], the only battle west of the Mississippi River in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n*The first capital of Upper Louisiana for the United States, the [[Louisiana Purchase]] north of the [[33rd parallel north|33rd parallel]] that was the original [[Louisiana Territory]] in 1803.\n*The [[Three Flags Day]] ceremony in 1804 in which Spain formally turned over Louisiana to France, less than 24 hours before France then officially turned it over to the United States. This technically completed the Louisiana Purchase, and also cleared the way for [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] to legally begin their [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|exploration]] of the continental west, which Spain had prohibited.\n\nAlmost all of the historic buildings associated with this period had been replaced by newer buildings.  His idea was to raze all of the buildings in the original St. Louis platted area and replace it with a park with \"a central feature, a shaft, a building, an arch, or something which would symbolize American culture and civilization.\"\n\nSmith pitched the idea to [[Bernard Dickmann]] who quickly assembled a meeting of St. Louis civic leaders on December 15, 1933 at the Jefferson Hotel and they endorsed the plan and Smith became chairman of what would become the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (a position he would hold until 1949 with a one-year exception).\n\nThe Commission then defined the area, got cost estimates of $30 million to buy the land, clear the buildings and erect a park and monument.  With promises from the federal government (via the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission) to join if the City of St. Louis could raise money.\n\nThe area to be included in the park was bounded by the [[Eads Bridge]]/Washington Avenue on the north and Poplar Street on the south, the Mississippi River on the east and Third Street (now [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|Interstate 44]]) on the west.  The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], just west of Third Street, was added in 1940.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O\u2019Neil|first1=Tim|title=With cornice repairs complete, scaffold around St. Louis' Old Courthouse coming down|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/with-cornice-repairs-complete-scaffold-around-st-louis-old-courthouse/article_2930a6da-79a0-5f39-9f80-102cacb5d64e.html|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe only building in this area not included was the [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France|Old Cathedral]], which is on the site of St. Louis first church and was opposite the home of St. Louis founder [[Auguste Chouteau]].  The founders of the city were buried in its graveyard (but were moved in 1849 to [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] during a [[cholera]] outbreak).\n\nTaking away 40 blocks in the center of St. Louis was bitterly fought by some sources\u2014particularly the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title= Editorial |work= Jefferson City Daily Capital News |date= June 24, 1939}}{{full citation needed|date= February 2015}}</ref> On September 10, 1935, the voters of St. Louis approved a $7.5 million bond issue to buy the property.

Interest in the monument was fed after the war as it was to be the first big monument in the post-World War II era.\n\nThe estimated cost of the competition was $225,000 and Smith personally donated $40,000.  Civic leaders held the nationwide competition in 1947 to select a design for the main portion of the Memorial space.\n\nArchitect [[Eero Saarinen]] won this competition with plans for a {{convert|590|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[catenary]] arch to be placed on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]]. However, these plans were modified over the next 15 years, placing the arch on higher ground and adding {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} in height and width.\n\nThe central architectural feature at the base of the arch is the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], which was once the tallest building in Missouri and has a dome similar to the [[United States Capitol]] and was placed on the building during the [[American Civil War]] at the same time as that on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSaarinen developed the shape with the help of architectural engineer [[Hannskarl Bandel]]. It is not a pure inverted [[catenary]]. Saarinen preferred a shape that was slightly elongated and thinner towards the top, a shape that produces a subtle soaring effect, and transfers more of the structure's weight downward rather than outward at the base.\n\nWhen Saarinen won the competition, the official notification was sent to \"E. Saarinen\", thinking it to be the architect's father [[Eliel Saarinen]], who had also submitted an entry. The family celebrated with a bottle of champagne, and two hours later an embarrassed official called to say the winner was, in fact, the younger Saarinen. The elder Saarinen then broke out a second bottle of champagne to celebrate his son's success.\n\nAmong the five finalists was local St. Louis architect [[Harris Armstrong]].\n\n===1950s===\nLand for the memorial was formally dedicated on June 10, 1950 by [[Harry S. Truman]].  However the [[Korean War]] began and the project was put on hold.\n\nOn June 23, 1959, work begins on covering railroad tracks that cut across the memorial grounds.\n\n===1960s===\nOn February 11, 1961, excavation began, and that September 1, Saarinen died. On February 12, 1963, the first stainless steel triangle that formed the first section of the arch was set in place on the south leg.\n\nOn October 28, 1965, it was completed, costing approximately $15 million to build. The adjacent park was designed by landscape architect [[Dan Kiley]]. Along with all other historical areas of the National Park Service, the memorial was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] dedicated the arch on May 25, 1968.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1984, Congress authorized the enlargement of the Memorial to include up to {{convert|100|acre|ha}} on the east bank of the Mississippi River in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. Funds were authorized to begin land acquisition, but Congress placed a moratorium upon NPS land acquisitions in fiscal year 1998. The moratorium continued into the 21st century, with expansion becoming less likely because of the construction of a [[Riverboat casino|riverboat gambling facility]] and related amenities.\n\n===1990s===\nDuring the [[Great Flood of 1993]], Mississippi flood waters reached halfway up the Grand Staircase on the east.\n\nIn 1999, the arch tram queue areas were renovated at a cost of about $2.2 million. As well, the [[Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site]] in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]], was put under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the Memorial.\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Missouri quarter, reverse side, 2003.jpg|thumb|The Missouri state quarter depicting the Gateway Arch and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]]]\nThe arch was featured on the Missouri state quarter in 2003.\n\nIn 2007 St. Louis Mayor [[Francis Slay]] and former Missouri Senator [[John Danforth]] asked the National Park Service to create a more \"active\" use of the grounds of the memorial and model it on [[Millennium Park]] in [[Chicago]] including the possibility of restaurants, fountains, ice skating, swimming, and other activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1250042.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628124857/http://www.semissourian.com/story/1250042.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2018 |title=St. Louis hopes to obtain part of Arch grounds | last=Salter |first=Jim |work=[[Southeast Missourian]] |date=August 29, 2007 |access-date=April 20, 2017}}</ref> The National Park Service was not in favor of the plan noting that the only other overt development pressure on national park property has been at the [[Jackson Hole Airport]] in [[Grand Teton National Park]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/10DA9EE598C17FAD86257345007A63F0?OpenDocument |title= City Leaders Pitch Local Control of Arch Grounds |work= St. Louis Post Dispatch |date= August 29, 2007 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131214652/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/10DA9EE598C17FAD86257345007A63F0?OpenDocument |archivedate= January 31, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nFor most of its life, the Memorial was largely separated from the rest of [[Downtown St. Louis]] by a sunken section of [[I-70]] (now I-44 with the rerouting of I-70 over a new bridge), but in 2014, a lid was installed over the highway, creating the foundation for a park connecting downtown with the Memorial grounds.
