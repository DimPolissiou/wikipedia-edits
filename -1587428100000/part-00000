The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words \"Benefit, Honor and Glory\" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 \"links\" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto \"Benefit, Honor and Glory.\" At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.\n\n===Standard (flag)===\nThe standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.\n\n===Special copy of the Constitution===\nThe President also has a special copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.\n\n===Legal basis of the insignia===\nThese insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 1996, \u211633, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 2000, \u211619, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees.

In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:Kremlin Senate-1.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Kremlin Senate]], is the working residence of the President of Russia]]\n[[File:2018 inauguration of Vladimir Putin 05.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Vladimir Putin in Presidential Cabinet]]\n\nThe primary working President's residence is the [[Kremlin Senate|Senate building]] (also known as 1st building) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] complex.<ref name=\"residences\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml The Presidential Residences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828095301/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml |date=28 August 2009 }}</ref> Also the President can use the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (used for official ceremonies and meetings).

On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree \"On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family,\" and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.\n\nThis law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:\n\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.\n*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity.

The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words \"Benefit, Honor and Glory\" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 \"links\" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto \"Benefit, Honor and Glory.\" At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.\n\n===Standard (flag)===\nThe standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.\n\n===Special copy of the Constitution===\nThe President also has a special copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver.

In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:Kremlin Senate-1.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Kremlin Senate]], is the working residence of the President of Russia]]\n[[File:2018 inauguration of Vladimir Putin 05.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Vladimir Putin in Presidential Cabinet]]\n\nThe primary working President's residence is the [[Kremlin Senate|Senate building]] (also known as 1st building) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] complex.<ref name=\"residences\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml The Presidential Residences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828095301/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml |date=28 August 2009 }}</ref> Also the President can use the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (used for official ceremonies and meetings).

On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree \"On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family,\" and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.\n\nThis law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:\n\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.\n*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity.

He graduated from [[Tbilisi State University]], Georgia, with a degree in Chemistry in 1974. He began his career as a Research Associate at the Institute of Stable Isotopes in Tbilisi, Georgia, where he was working on the development of the novel techniques of separating carbon isotopes for medical and military applications. He received additional training in the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Moscow, from 1975 to 1977 under the mentorship of Alexander Chaikin. Bekker presented the results of his research on the mechanism of hydrogen-fluorine chain reactions at several national conferences.<ref name=NJMS/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255094394_Process_for_production_of_light_hydrocarbons_by_treatment_of_heavy_hydrocarbons_with_water|title=Process for production of light hydrocarbons by treatment of heavy hydrocarbons with water}}</ref>\n\nAfter moving to the [[United States]] in 1979, he joined the Catalysis Research Corporation (CRC). His research focused on developing advanced technologies for reducing emissions associated with [[Carbon-based fuel|carbon-based fuel]]. In 1980-81, Bekker was a visiting scholar at [[Columbia University]] at the Renewable Energy Research Laboratory Department of Energy supported his research. In 1982, he left CRC and joined Allied Chemicals (currently [[Honeywell]]) in 1982 as a Project Engineer. During his tenure at Allied, he advanced a new process of converting heavy hydrocarbons to fuels using [[supercritical fluid]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4737384.html|title=Deposition of thin films using supercritical fluids}}</ref> This work culminated in six U.S. patents and several publications.<ref name=PAT/>\n\nIn 1981, Bekker enrolled in the Master of Engineering Program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which he completed in 1984 and enrolled in the PhD program at the same institution. The focus of Bekker\u2019s research at that time was changing from chemical to biomedical engineering. His doctoral thesis, \"Transient Analysis of Macromolecular Blood-Tissue Exchange in Microvascular Bed,\" added in the understanding of transendothelial transport of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.njit.edu/vol01/etd/1980s/1987/njit-etd1987-012/njit-etd1987-012.pdf|title=Transient analysis of m acrom olecular blood-tissue exchange in microvascular bed}}</ref> The NJIT Presidential Scholarship Award supported this research. The results of this work were presented at various forums and published in several publications, including one in ''[[Circulation Research]]''.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\nMathematical modeling of biological systems sparked Bekker's interest in applying engineering principles to the analysis of the effects of drugs on mammalian circulation. Practical applications of this approach required understanding of the pathophysiology of the diseases, so Bekker started his study of Medicine in 1987 and completed a four-year medical school program at the [[Rutgers New Jersey Medical School]] in 1991, which was followed by a residency training in Anesthesiology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing his residency in 1995, Bekker was recruited for the position of Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at [[NYU Langone Medical Center|New York University Medical Center]]. Bekker\u2019s work in the area of computer simulation of physiological systems was recognized nationally. He was invited to speak at the meetings organized by the [[American Society of Anesthesiology]], Society for Technology in Anesthesia, as well as at various regional conferences. His clinical work was focused on providing perioperative care for neurosurgical patients.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\nIn 1999, Bekker was appointed Chief of Neuroanesthesia Service. He also directed Clinical Research in the Department.<ref name=RUT/> He led several clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals. In 2001, Bekker was promoted to the academic rank of Associate Professor of Anesthesiology with a joint appointment in the Department of Neurosurgery. In addition to his clinical research, Bekker established Basic Research Lab. His basic science research focused on neuropharmacology and understanding the effect of anesthetics on cognition.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\nBekker was elected to the board of directors of the Society for Neurosurgical Anesthesiology and Critical Care in 2005. He was responsible for the educational mission of the society. From 2005-2010, he directed the Neuroanesthesia Update CME course offered by the NYUMC. He was invited to be a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesia and Critical Care in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.lww.com/jnsa/Pages/editorialboard.aspx|title=Editorial Board - Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesia}}</ref> In 2008, Bekker became Vice Chair for Research at the Department of Anesthesiology and was promoted to the rank of full Professor. In the same year, Bekker founded the Foundation for Perioperative Research and Education (FPRE), which supported start-up research projects within the institution. He received several research grants, including NIH awards. Throughout his carrier, he has served on the ASA Academic Anesthesiology, Clinical Neurosciences, Performance and Outcomes, and Neuroanesthesia Committees.<ref name=RUT/>\n\nIn 2012, Bekker became Professor and Chair of the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School with a joint appointment at the Department of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neurosciences. At the same time, he was asked to serve on the executive board of the New Jersey Society of Anesthesiologists.<ref name=RUT/>\n\n== Research and work ==\nBekker is an author of more than 120 peer-reviewed publications in the scientific journals as well as more than 200 scientific abstracts and meeting proceedings. In addition to publications in academic journals, his early work in industry led to the award of six U.S. Patents.<ref name=PAT/> He has conducted more than 40 clinical and basic research investigations, the majority of which was funded by the NIH, American Heart Association (AHA), Empire Clinical Research Program as well as the Pharmaceutical Industry.<ref name=RUT/>\n\nBekker's work has been focused in the areas of clinical pharmacology of sedatives and analgesics, understanding the effects of perioperative stress and anesthetics on cognition, particularly in the elderly, and brain protection.<ref name=RUT/>\n\nBekker\u2019s work on expanding uses of dexmedetomidine, a new agent introduced in 1999 for sedation of critically ill patients, led to FDA approval of this drug for procedural sedation. Bekker demonstrated that this drug mitigates the harmful effect of perioperative stress on cognition and improves postoperative recovery.<Ref>{{cite web|title=The effect of dexmedetomidine on perioperative hemodynamics in patients undergoing craniotomy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15021281}}</ref>\n\nBekker conducted several studies addressing the issue of postoperative brain dysfunction in the elderly. In 2012, he published an article in ''Anesthesiology'', which for the first time, demonstrated that the morphology of the brain is affected by the surgery. Although this effect may not necessarily lead to cognitive deterioration in healthy adults, it may accelerate the progression of dementia in a vulnerable population. Clinical trial supported by the grant from the National Institute of Aging confirmed these findings.<Ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3418798/|title=Surgery and Brain Atrophy In Cognitively Normal Elderly Subjects and Subjects Diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment}}</ref>\n\nBekker was a Principal Investigator on multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3/3b studies that evaluated the efficacy of new analgesics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insights.ovid.com/american-therapeutics/ajthe/2010/11/000/phase-iiib-randomized-double-blind-placebo/8/00045391|title=A Phase IIIb, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine for Sedation During Awake Fiberoptic Intubation}}</ref> He was particularly interested in expanding use on non-opioid alternatives to treat postoperative pain.

He graduated from [[Tbilisi State University]], Georgia, with a degree in Chemistry in 1974. He began his career as a Research Associate at the Institute of Stable Isotopes in Tbilisi, Georgia, where he was working on the development of the novel techniques of separating carbon isotopes for medical and military applications. He received additional training in the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Moscow, from 1975 to 1977 under the mentorship of Alexander Chaikin. Bekker presented the results of his research on the mechanism of hydrogen-fluorine chain reactions at several national conferences.<ref name=NJMS/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255094394_Process_for_production_of_light_hydrocarbons_by_treatment_of_heavy_hydrocarbons_with_water|title=Process for production of light hydrocarbons by treatment of heavy hydrocarbons with water}}</ref>\n\nAfter moving to the [[United States]] in 1979, he joined the Catalysis Research Corporation (CRC). His research focused on developing advanced technologies for reducing emissions associated with [[Carbon-based fuel|carbon-based fuel]]. In 1980-81, Bekker was a visiting scholar at [[Columbia University]] at the Renewable Energy Research Laboratory Department of Energy supported his research. In 1982, he left CRC and joined Allied Chemicals (currently [[Honeywell]]) in 1982 as a Project Engineer. During his tenure at Allied, he advanced a new process of converting heavy hydrocarbons to fuels using [[supercritical fluid]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4737384.html|title=Deposition of thin films using supercritical fluids}}</ref> This work culminated in six U.S. patents and several publications.<ref name=PAT/>\n\nIn 1981, Bekker enrolled in the Master of Engineering Program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which he completed in 1984 and enrolled in the PhD program at the same institution. The focus of Bekker\u2019s research at that time was changing from chemical to biomedical engineering. His doctoral thesis, \"Transient Analysis of Macromolecular Blood-Tissue Exchange in Microvascular Bed,\" added in the understanding of transendothelial transport of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.njit.edu/vol01/etd/1980s/1987/njit-etd1987-012/njit-etd1987-012.pdf|title=Transient analysis of m acrom olecular blood-tissue exchange in microvascular bed}}</ref> The NJIT Presidential Scholarship Award supported this research. The results of this work were presented at various forums and published in several publications, including one in ''[[Circulation Research]]''.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\nMathematical modeling of biological systems sparked Bekker's interest in applying engineering principles to the analysis of the effects of drugs on mammalian circulation. Practical applications of this approach required understanding of the pathophysiology of the diseases, so Bekker started his study of Medicine in 1987 and completed a four-year medical school program at the [[Rutgers New Jersey Medical School]] in 1991, which was followed by a residency training in Anesthesiology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing his residency in 1995, Bekker was recruited for the position of Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at [[NYU Langone Medical Center|New York University Medical Center]]. Bekker\u2019s work in the area of computer simulation of physiological systems was recognized nationally. He was invited to speak at the meetings organized by the [[American Society of Anesthesiology]], Society for Technology in Anesthesia, as well as at various regional conferences. His clinical work was focused on providing perioperative care for neurosurgical patients.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\nIn 1999, Bekker was appointed Chief of Neuroanesthesia Service. He also directed Clinical Research in the Department.<ref name=RUT/> He led several clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals. In 2001, Bekker was promoted to the academic rank of Associate Professor of Anesthesiology with a joint appointment in the Department of Neurosurgery. In addition to his clinical research, Bekker established Basic Research Lab. His basic science research focused on neuropharmacology and understanding the effect of anesthetics on cognition.<ref name=NJMS/>\n\nBekker was elected to the board of directors of the Society for Neurosurgical Anesthesiology and Critical Care in 2005. He was responsible for the educational mission of the society. From 2005-2010, he directed the Neuroanesthesia Update CME course offered by the NYUMC. He was invited to be a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesia and Critical Care in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.lww.com/jnsa/Pages/editorialboard.aspx|title=Editorial Board - Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesia}}</ref> In 2008, Bekker became Vice Chair for Research at the Department of Anesthesiology and was promoted to the rank of full Professor. In the same year, Bekker founded the Foundation for Perioperative Research and Education (FPRE), which supported start-up research projects within the institution. He received several research grants, including NIH awards. Throughout his carrier, he has served on the ASA Academic Anesthesiology, Clinical Neurosciences, Performance and Outcomes, and Neuroanesthesia Committees.<ref name=RUT/>\n\nIn 2012, Bekker became Professor and Chair of the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School with a joint appointment at the Department of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neurosciences. At the same time, he was asked to serve on the executive board of the New Jersey Society of Anesthesiologists.<ref name=RUT/>\n\n== Research and work ==\nBekker is an author of more than 120 peer-reviewed publications in the scientific journals as well as more than 200 scientific abstracts and meeting proceedings. In addition to publications in academic journals, his early work in industry led to the award of six U.S. Patents.<ref name=PAT/> He has conducted more than 40 clinical and basic research investigations, the majority of which was funded by the NIH, American Heart Association (AHA), Empire Clinical Research Program as well as the Pharmaceutical Industry.<ref name=RUT/>\n\nBekker's work has been focused in the areas of clinical pharmacology of sedatives and analgesics, understanding the effects of perioperative stress and anesthetics on cognition, particularly in the elderly, and brain protection.<ref name=RUT/>\n\nBekker\u2019s work on expanding uses of dexmedetomidine, a new agent introduced in 1999 for sedation of critically ill patients, led to FDA approval of this drug for procedural sedation. Bekker demonstrated that this drug mitigates the harmful effect of perioperative stress on cognition and improves postoperative recovery.<Ref>{{cite web|title=The effect of dexmedetomidine on perioperative hemodynamics in patients undergoing craniotomy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15021281}}</ref>\n\nBekker conducted several studies addressing the issue of postoperative brain dysfunction in the elderly. In 2012, he published an article in ''Anesthesiology'', which for the first time, demonstrated that the morphology of the brain is affected by the surgery. Although this effect may not necessarily lead to cognitive deterioration in healthy adults, it may accelerate the progression of dementia in a vulnerable population. Clinical trial supported by the grant from the National Institute of Aging confirmed these findings.<Ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3418798/|title=Surgery and Brain Atrophy In Cognitively Normal Elderly Subjects and Subjects Diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment}}</ref>\n\nBekker was a Principal Investigator on multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3/3b studies that evaluated the efficacy of new analgesics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insights.ovid.com/american-therapeutics/ajthe/2010/11/000/phase-iiib-randomized-double-blind-placebo/8/00045391|title=A Phase IIIb, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine for Sedation During Awake Fiberoptic Intubation}}</ref> He was particularly interested in expanding use on non-opioid alternatives to treat postoperative pain. Over the years, Bekker published more than 40 papers on the advantages of multimodal analgesia in neurosurgery.<ref name=GS/>\n\n== Awards and Honors ==\n*1983-present - Tau Beta Pi, Engineering Honor Society\n*1986-7 - Presidential Scholarship Award New Jersey Institute of Technology\n*2005 - present - Association of University Anesthesiologists (Honorific Society of Academic Anesthesiologists)\n*2015 - Fellow of American Society of Anesthesiologists\n*2016 - Distinguished New Jersey Medical School Alumni Award (The Charles L.
