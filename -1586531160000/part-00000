The technical manifestation of this undocumented doctrine was the research-and-development of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery; the former large enough to completely (or nearly) wipe out large cities and entire urbanized regions in one strike (i.e. with a single payload and a single aircraft). An example of this would be the creation of the [[N1 (rocket)|N-1 orbital combat rocket]] (GRAU index 11A52) per the Resolution of the Council of Ministers issued on 23&nbsp;June 1960. With a starting weight of 2200&nbsp;tons and a nuclear warhead weighing 75&nbsp;tons, its estimated nuclear yield (though unknown exactly) could surpass that of a 150&nbsp;megaton-yield 40&nbsp;ton warhead delivered by a [[UR-500]] missile.\n\nThe development of such weapons also required mandatory and practical aerial bombardment methods as, for a high-yield (thermo-)nuclear explosion to reach maximal effect, the payload has to be detonated at an optimal height for the shock wave to reach the greatest force and range. In addition, ultra-large-yield thermonuclear bombs were considered by the Long Range Aviation units of the USSR, as their use fits the \"cause the greatest damage to the enemy with a minimal number of carriers (i.e. bombers)\" doctrine, while it was also necessary to consider the practical feasibility of such heavy thermonuclear weapons with reliably predictable characteristics. Before this, an underwater \"doomsday weapon\" considered by Soviet military and technical experts \u2013 essentially a giant torpedo launched by a dedicated nuclear submarine \u2013 was planned for development which would detonate its nuclear warhead near the US coast causing a huge tsunami. This project (known as the T-15 torpedo) was abandoned after more detailed consideration as its combat effectiveness was questionable.\n\n[[File:Tsar Bomba Revised.jpg|thumb|left|A Tsar Bomba-type casing on display at [[Sarov]]]]\n\nDesign work on the Tsar Bomba started from Autumn&nbsp;1954<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryparitet.com/vp/06/ |title=\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430 |trans-title=Superbomb |website=www.militaryparitet.com}}</ref> to autumn 1961 (with a two-year break from 1959-1960). A {{convert|100|MtonTNT|adj=on}} nuclear bomb was also under development in NII-1011 at this time. This somehow contradicts partially with the official history of the institute (now the [[All-Russian Scientific Research Institute Of Technical Physics]]); the official history stated that the Ministry of Medium Engineering of the USSR order concerning the creation of a corresponding research institute was not signed until 5&nbsp;April 1955, with design work starting a few months later.

Subsequent analysis indicated that to carry such a heavy, concentrated load, the Tu-95 bomber carrying the Tsar Bomba needed to have its engines, bomb bay, suspension and release mechanisms seriously redesigned. The Tsar Bomba's dimensional and weight drawings were passed in the first half of 1955, together with its placement layout drawing. The Tsar Bomba's weight accounted for 15% the weight of its Tu-95 carrier as expected. The carrier, aside from having its fuel tanks and bomb bay doors removed, had its BD-206 bomb-holder replaced by a new, heavier beam-type BD7-95-242 (or BD-242) holder attached directly to the longitudinal weight-bearing beams. The problem of how to release the bomb was also solved; the bomb-holder would release all three of its locks in a synchronous fashion via electro-automatic mechanisms as required by safety protocols.\n\nThe CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a draft Joint Resolution on 12&nbsp;March 1956 on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'', which read:\n\n{{quote|Adopt a draft resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202''.\nParagraphs required for inclusion in the draft resolution:\n\n(a) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade [[Avraami Zavenyagin|Zavenyagin]]) and the Ministry of Defense of the USSR (Comrade [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]) at the end of the preparatory work for the test of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to report to the CPSU Central Committee on the situation;\n\n(b) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade Zavenyagin) to solve the issue of introducing a special stage of protection into the design of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to ensure disarming of the product in the event of a failure of the parachute system, as well as their proposals reported to the CPSU Central Committee.\n\nComrades [[Boris Vannikov|Vannikov]] and Kurchatov are assigned to edit the final version of this resolution.}}\n\nA Joint Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers (Nr. 357-28ss) was issued on 17&nbsp;March 1956 which mandated that OKB-156 begin conversion of a Tu-95 bomber into a high-yield nuclear bomb carrier. These works were carried out in the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] from May to September&nbsp;1956. The converted bomber, designated the '''Tu-95V''', was accepted for duty and was handed over for flight tests which, including a release of a mock-up \"superbomb\", were conducted under the command of Colonel S.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Kulikov until 1959 and passed without major issues.\n\nExplosive components and [[Explosive lens|lens]] were designed by a small team of [[List of Russian physicists|Russian physicists]] led by [[Yulii Khariton]] that included [[Andrei Sakharov]], Victor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Smirnov, and [[Yuri Trutnev (scientist)|Yuri Trutnev]]. Shortly after the Tsar Bomba was detonated, Sakharov began speaking out against [[nuclear weapon]]s, which culminated in him becoming a [[Soviet dissidents|dissident]].<ref name=\"Sakharov memoirs\" /><ref name=\"Adamsky and Smirnov\" />\n\n==Test==\nDespite the creation of the [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95V]] bomb-carrier aircraft, the actual test of the Tsar Bomba was postponed for political reasons; namely Khrushchev's visit to the United States and a pause in the Cold War. The Tu-95V during this period was flown to Uzin (situated in today's Ukraine) and was used as a training aircraft, therefore it was no longer listed as a combat aircraft. With the beginning of a new round of the Cold War in 1961 the test was resumed. The Tu-95V had all connectors in its automatic release mechanism replaced, the bomb bay doors removed and the aircraft itself covered with a [[Anti-flash white|special reflective white paint]]. Khrushchev himself announced the upcoming tests of the Tsar Bomba in his report at the 22nd&nbsp;Congress of the CPSU on 17&nbsp;October 1961.\n\n[[File:Ivan bomb.png|thumb|left|Site of the detonation]]\nThe Tsar Bomba was tested on 30&nbsp;October 1961, flown to its test site by Major [[Andrei Durnovtsev]]. The Tu-95 bombers were designed to carry much lighter and smaller weapons (at maximum 27&nbsp;tons ''after'' modernization<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/bomber/tu95v.html |title=Tu-95V |website=airway.ru}}</ref>), meaning the Tsar Bomba was too big to be placed on a missile and too heavy for the planes to transport it to the target with enough fuel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTaking off from the [[Olenya (air base)|Olenya]] airfield in the [[Kola Peninsula]], the release plane was accompanied by a [[Tu-16]] observer plane that took air samples and filmed the test.

This was probably due to the \"overlay\" of information about the excess of the actual explosion power over the estimated one by about 20% (in fact, by 14-17%) to the original design bomb power (100&nbsp;megatons, more precisely 101.5&nbsp;megatons). The newspaper Pravda added fuel to the fire of such rumors, on the pages of which it was officially stated that \u201cthe AN602 is the atomic weapon yesterday. Now even more powerful charges have been created.\u201d  In fact, the designers were considering the possibility of creating more powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] munitions (for example the warhead of the UR-500 missile with a capacity of 150&nbsp;megatons) but designs were developed no further.\n\nAt different times rumors circulated that the bomb power was reduced by 2&nbsp;times compared to the planned one as scientists were afraid of a self-sustaining fusion reaction involving the atmosphere and the ocean in the hydrogen reaction and subsequent oxygen burnout. Before [[Trinity (nuclear test)|the ''Trinity'' test]] in 1945, similar concerns had been expressed about the occurrence of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction in the atmosphere despite the contradiction of such a possibility to all known information about nuclear reactions. Just before that explosion, a young scientist who was nervous because of such fears was removed from the test site on the advice of doctors. In fact, detonation of neither the atmosphere nor the ocean is possible at any power of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] explosion.\n\nThere is a rumor about the extremely rapid development of the Tsar Bomba, claiming that it was completely constructed 112&nbsp;days after the commission of Khrushchev at the meeting on 10&nbsp;July 1961. In fact the development began in 1956.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Father of All Bombs]]\n*[[GBU-43/B MOAB]]\n* [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]\n* [[Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System]], rumored Russian thermonuclear-capable autonomous underwater vehicle, CIA code-named ''Kanyon''\n* [[Cold War]]\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Soviet Union}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/TsarBomba.html |title=Tsar Bomba |editor-first=Carey |editor-last=Sublette |website=NuclearWeaponArchive.org |date=30 October 2018}}\n\n* {{cite media |medium=video |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=90 |title=Video of the Tsar Bomba delivery, blast and cloud}}{{cite web |title=Sonicbomb.com |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=39}}\n\n* {{youtube |title= ''Tsar Bomb'' \u2013 Official Chronicle |id=lfi0zYoqCY0}}\n\n* {{youtube |title=World's Biggest Bomb |id=uaoJFhQBb_s}}\n\n<!-- not needed: there is a uniform ~geohack link -- *[http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=73.807093,54.981766&spn=0.005852,0.037594&t=h&z=15&lci=lmc:wikipedia_en Google Maps] -->\n\n{{Russian and Soviet Aircraft Ordnance}}\n\n[[Category:1961 in military history]]\n[[Category:1961 in science]]\n[[Category:1961 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Explosions in 1961]]\n[[Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Novaya Zemlya]]\n[[Category:Nuclear bombs of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Russian inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet nuclear weapons testing]]\n[[Category:October 1961 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Expand Russian|\u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c-\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox weapon\n| name    =Tsar Bomba\n| image   = Tsar photo11.jpg\n| caption = The [[mushroom cloud]] of Tsar Bomba seen from a distance of {{cvt|161|km}}.

The technical manifestation of this undocumented doctrine was the research-and-development of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery; the former large enough to completely (or nearly) wipe out large cities and entire urbanized regions in one strike (i.e. with a single payload and a single aircraft). An example of this would be the creation of the [[N1 (rocket)|N-1 orbital combat rocket]] (GRAU index 11A52) per the Resolution of the Council of Ministers issued on 23&nbsp;June 1960. With a starting weight of 2200&nbsp;tons and a nuclear warhead weighing 75&nbsp;tons, its estimated nuclear yield (though unknown exactly) could surpass that of a 150&nbsp;megaton-yield 40&nbsp;ton warhead delivered by a [[UR-500]] missile.\n\nThe development of such weapons also required mandatory and practical aerial bombardment methods as, for a high-yield (thermo-)nuclear explosion to reach maximal effect, the payload has to be detonated at an optimal height for the shock wave to reach the greatest force and range. In addition, ultra-large-yield thermonuclear bombs were considered by the Long Range Aviation units of the USSR, as their use fits the \"cause the greatest damage to the enemy with a minimal number of carriers (i.e. bombers)\" doctrine, while it was also necessary to consider the practical feasibility of such heavy thermonuclear weapons with reliably predictable characteristics. Before this, an underwater \"doomsday weapon\" considered by Soviet military and technical experts \u2013 essentially a giant torpedo launched by a dedicated nuclear submarine \u2013 was planned for development which would detonate its nuclear warhead near the US coast causing a huge tsunami. This project (known as the T-15 torpedo) was abandoned after more detailed consideration as its combat effectiveness was questionable.\n\n[[File:Tsar Bomba Revised.jpg|thumb|left|A Tsar Bomba-type casing on display at [[Sarov]]]]\n\nDesign work on the Tsar Bomba started from Autumn&nbsp;1954<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryparitet.com/vp/06/ |title=\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430 |trans-title=Superbomb |website=www.militaryparitet.com}}</ref> to autumn 1961 (with a two-year break from 1959-1960).

This somehow contradicts partially with the official history of the institute (now the [[All-Russian Scientific Research Institute Of Technical Physics]]); the official history stated that the Ministry of Medium Engineering of the USSR order concerning the creation of a corresponding research institute was not signed until 5&nbsp;April 1955, with design work starting a few months later.

Tupolev appointed his deputy for weapon systems, Aleksandr Nadashkevich, as the head of the Topic. Subsequent analysis indicated that to carry such a heavy, concentrated load, the Tu-95 bomber carrying the Tsar Bomba needed to have its engines, bomb bay, suspension and release mechanisms seriously redesigned. The Tsar Bomba's dimensional and weight drawings were passed in the first half of 1955, together with its placement layout drawing. The Tsar Bomba's weight accounted for 15% the weight of its Tu-95 carrier as expected. The carrier, aside from having its fuel tanks and bomb bay doors removed, had its BD-206 bomb-holder replaced by a new, heavier beam-type BD7-95-242 (or BD-242) holder attached directly to the longitudinal weight-bearing beams. The problem of how to release the bomb was also solved; the bomb-holder would release all three of its locks in a synchronous fashion via electro-automatic mechanisms as required by safety protocols.\n\nThe CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a draft Joint Resolution on 12&nbsp;March 1956 on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'', which read:\n\n{{quote|Adopt a draft resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on the preparation and testing of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202''.\nParagraphs required for inclusion in the draft resolution:\n\n(a) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade [[Avraami Zavenyagin|Zavenyagin]]) and the Ministry of Defense of the USSR (Comrade [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]) at the end of the preparatory work for the test of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to report to the CPSU Central Committee on the situation;\n\n(b) The Ministry of Medium Engineering (Comrade Zavenyagin) to solve the issue of introducing a special stage of protection into the design of ''izdeliye&nbsp;202'' to ensure disarming of the product in the event of a failure of the parachute system, as well as their proposals reported to the CPSU Central Committee.\n\nComrades [[Boris Vannikov|Vannikov]] and Kurchatov are assigned to edit the final version of this resolution.}}\n\nA Joint Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers (Nr. 357-28ss) was issued on 17&nbsp;March 1956 which mandated that OKB-156 begin conversion of a Tu-95 bomber into a high-yield nuclear bomb carrier. These works were carried out in the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] from May to September&nbsp;1956. The converted bomber, designated the '''Tu-95V''', was accepted for duty and was handed over for flight tests which, including a release of a mock-up \"superbomb\", were conducted under the command of Colonel S.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Kulikov until 1959 and passed without major issues.\n\nExplosive components and [[Explosive lens|lens]] were designed by a small team of [[List of Russian physicists|Russian physicists]] led by [[Yulii Khariton]] that included [[Andrei Sakharov]], Victor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Smirnov, and [[Yuri Trutnev (scientist)|Yuri Trutnev]].

The Tu-95V during this period was flown to Uzin (situated in today's Ukraine) and was used as a training aircraft, therefore it was no longer listed as a combat aircraft. With the beginning of a new round of the Cold War in 1961 the test was resumed. The Tu-95V had all connectors in its automatic release mechanism replaced, the bomb bay doors removed and the aircraft itself covered with a [[Anti-flash white|special reflective white paint]]. Khrushchev himself announced the upcoming tests of the Tsar Bomba in his report at the 22nd&nbsp;Congress of the CPSU on 17&nbsp;October 1961.\n\n[[File:Ivan bomb.png|thumb|left|Site of the detonation]]\nThe Tsar Bomba was tested on 30&nbsp;October 1961, flown to its test site by Major [[Andrei Durnovtsev]].

In fact, Soviets restarted their tests and broke the unilateral voluntary moratorium 30&nbsp;days before ''Tsar Bomba'', testing 45&nbsp;times in that month. Since the moratorium was unilateral there was no multilateral legal obstacle. The U.S. had declared their own one-year unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests and as that year had expired, the US had already announced that it considered itself free to resume testing without further notice. Later it was stated that the U.S. had not resumed testing at the time of the ''Tsar Bomba'' test.<ref name=\"Sherman, Robert 2008\">{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Robert |url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/ctbt/chron1.htm |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Chronology |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=30 May 2008}}</ref> That announcement was in error, as the US had in fact tested five times under [[Operation Nougat]] between the USSR's ending of the moratorium on 1&nbsp;October and the Tsar Bomba test on 30&nbsp;October.\n*\"World's Biggest Bomb\", a 2011 episode of the [[PBS]] documentary series ''[[Secrets of the Dead#Season 10 (2010\u20132011)|Secrets of the Dead]]'' produced by Blink Films & [[WNET]], chronicles the events leading to the detonations of [[Castle Bravo]] and the Tsar Bomba.\n\n== Hoaxes and myths ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nTest results of AN602 became the subject of rumors and hoaxes.\n\nSome publications claimed that the bomb's power reached 120&nbsp;megatons. This was probably due to the \"overlay\" of information about the excess of the actual explosion power over the estimated one by about 20% (in fact, by 14-17%) to the original design bomb power (100&nbsp;megatons, more precisely 101.5&nbsp;megatons). The newspaper Pravda added fuel to the fire of such rumors, on the pages of which it was officially stated that \u201cthe AN602 is the atomic weapon yesterday. Now even more powerful charges have been created.\u201d  In fact, the designers were considering the possibility of creating more powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] munitions (for example the warhead of the UR-500 missile with a capacity of 150&nbsp;megatons) but designs were developed no further.\n\nAt different times rumors circulated that the bomb power was reduced by 2&nbsp;times compared to the planned one as scientists were afraid of a self-sustaining fusion reaction involving the atmosphere and the ocean in the hydrogen reaction and subsequent oxygen burnout. Before [[Trinity (nuclear test)|the ''Trinity'' test]] in 1945, similar concerns had been expressed about the occurrence of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction in the atmosphere despite the contradiction of such a possibility to all known information about nuclear reactions. Just before that explosion, a young scientist who was nervous because of such fears was removed from the test site on the advice of doctors. In fact, detonation of neither the atmosphere nor the ocean is possible at any power of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] explosion.\n\nThere is a rumor about the extremely rapid development of the Tsar Bomba, claiming that it was completely constructed 112&nbsp;days after the commission of Khrushchev at the meeting on 10&nbsp;July 1961. In fact the development began in 1956.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Father of All Bombs]]\n*[[GBU-43/B MOAB]]\n* [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]\n* [[Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System]], rumored Russian thermonuclear-capable autonomous underwater vehicle, CIA code-named ''Kanyon''\n* [[Cold War]]\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Soviet Union}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/TsarBomba.html |title=Tsar Bomba |editor-first=Carey |editor-last=Sublette |website=NuclearWeaponArchive.org |date=30 October 2018}}\n\n* {{cite media |medium=video |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=90 |title=Video of the Tsar Bomba delivery, blast and cloud}}{{cite web |title=Sonicbomb.com |url=http://sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=39}}\n\n* {{youtube |title= ''Tsar Bomb'' \u2013 Official Chronicle |id=lfi0zYoqCY0}}\n\n* {{youtube |title=World's Biggest Bomb |id=uaoJFhQBb_s}}\n\n<!-- not needed: there is a uniform ~geohack link -- *[http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=73.807093,54.981766&spn=0.005852,0.037594&t=h&z=15&lci=lmc:wikipedia_en Google Maps] -->\n\n{{Russian and Soviet Aircraft Ordnance}}\n\n[[Category:1961 in military history]]\n[[Category:1961 in science]]\n[[Category:1961 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Explosions in 1961]]\n[[Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Novaya Zemlya]]\n[[Category:Nuclear bombs of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Russian inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet inventions]]\n[[Category:Soviet nuclear weapons testing]]\n[[Category:October 1961 events]]\n", "name_user": "Emil001", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammatical error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"}

Ta\u1e37\u1e37ap\u0101ka Annam\u0101c\u0101rya (Annamayya), widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha (Grandfather of Telugu songwriting) was a 15th-century Hindu saint, and is the earliest known Indian musician in Carnatic music to compose songs called sankirtanas in praise of the god Venkateswara.\n\nTo preserve the rich heritage of Annamayya compositions, Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam was taken up on an ambitious scale by the TTD and its propagation arms Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC) and Sri Venkateswara Recording Project (SVRP), designed by renowned film director K. Raghavendra Rao, a member of the TTD trust board. Music director M.M. Keeravani added grandeur to the program through his vital inputs.\n\nSinger Sunitha is the Anchor for this culturally unique show ever since the conception of the program. She also rendered the title song for this prestigious program series penned by lyricists Chandrabose, Ramajogayya Sastry, Anantha Sriram and composed by Sai Madhukar, Josya Bhatla.

Artists from all over the world are invited to perform in Nadaneerajanam in a planned manner and offer their devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Venkateshwara through nadopasana(worship through music). They sing compositions of great saint poets, perform different traditional dance forms as a seva(worship) to \"Sakala kala bhushitudu Sri Venkateshwara Swamy varu\"(Lord Venkateshwara).\n\n\"Brahmotsavam\" is the most important annual f\u00eate celebrated at Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala. During the festival, the Utsava-murti (processional deity) of the presiding deity Lord Venkateswara, along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi, will be taken on a procession on different Vahanams on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple.The celebration attracts pilgrims and tourists from all parts of India and across the world.

On each specific day, the Lord of Lords blesses his devotees in a specific ritual during the week days. These rituals are categorized as weekly \"pujas\". Limited number of devotees are allowed to take part in these weekly sevas on the issuance of limited number of tickets. In an attempt to bring these weekly \"seva\" more closer to larger devotees, SVBC came up with a concept of performing the same weekly rituals as they get performed on Lord Venkateshwara's main deity on a replica \"set\" so that the recording could get aired in SVBC channel on every weekday. VISESHA PUJA (ON MONDAYS), ASHTADALA \u2013 PADA PADMAARADHANA (ON TUESDAYS), SAHASRA KALASABHISHEKAM (ON WEDNESDAYS), TIRUPPAVADA SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), POOLANGI SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), ABHISHEKAM (ON FRIDAYS)\n\nSunitha Upadrasta offered her vocals to Srivaari set sevalu program presented by SVBC for two of the weekly seva's and Srivaari sevalu samaahaaram song as well that goes with the lyrics \"Enni janmala punyamo neekinni sevalu cheyagaa\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Seva\n!Lyric\n|-\n|Friday \u2013 Abhishekam\n|Saptagiri shrunga mangala taranga divya gagana gangaa teerthamula\n|-\n|Tuesday \u2013 Ashtadala paadapadmaaraadhana\n|Managala karamaina prathi mangala vaaramuna\n|}\n\n==== Thyaagaraaja Utsavaalu ====\nTyagaraja Aradhana is the annual festival glorifying Telugu saint composer Tyagaraja.

For His devotees, it is what Rome is to the Catholics and Mecca to the Muslims. For others, who step into this township out of curiosity or general interest, it is a seat of inner growth and learning that visitors describe as aweinspiring. Its draw lies in its power to nourish the soul and calm the mind. This sacred township welcomes thousands of spiritual seekers from every faith, and all corners of the globe each day, as they arrive to behold the sacred presence of Bhagawan Baba.\n\nSunitha presented devotional songs in the presence of Bhagawan on two different occasions. On Friday evening, 15 August 2008, She sang many light devotional songs and most of them were in Telugu. She was lost in the joy and ecstasy as she sang and Swami too was very happy listening to her. After she completed her planned quota of 6\u20137 songs, Swami asked her to sing some more. She sang one more and when Swami asked her to sing another, she seemed so very thrilled and happy. She also sang a Meera bhajan and finally concluded with Swami's bhajan, \"Giridhara Naagara Kunja Vihaari\" which everyone followed. Bhagawan had many words of encouragement for the singer and he very lovingly blessed her.

''Meera padavali'' and ''Aanota \u2013 Manasu palike vela'' are her two most known works composed by her Guru Kalaga Krishna Mohan. She also featured in the private album ''Sri Ramachandra Krupalu'', a bhajan by Tulsi Das and produced by Sunithanmusic.com.\n\n''Chandrashekara Ashtakam'' also takes a special mention for which music is composed by Sai Madhukar.\n\nFew other private albums to mention are ''Raghuram'', ''Sai Sudha'', ''Sri Venkateswara Thatwanidhi'', ''Sri Vallabha Bhakthi Geethalu'', ''Sai Darshanam'', ''Sri Chidvilasam'', ''Amma durgamma'', ''Pahimaam'', ''Sri Rama Charanam'', ''Govinda Ganamrutham'', ''Saye Dhaivam'', ''Bathuku Paata''.\n\n=== Voice-over artist ===\nSunitha stepped in to the world of dubbing quite unwillingly and eventually her ease at voice modulations made her the most sought dubbing artist for all the lead heroines ever after release of the movie Choodalani Undi in the year 1998 starring Mega star Chiranjeevi and Soundarya, in which she gave her voice to Soundarya. She achieved a very rare feat as a voice-over artist in Telugu film industry with a record breaking contribution of lending voice to 110+ actresses spread across 750+ films. The numbers by themselves speak volume about her career as a voice-over artist. She also holds a record of giving her voice for 60 movies in a single year.

Ta\u1e37\u1e37ap\u0101ka Annam\u0101c\u0101rya (Annamayya), widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha (Grandfather of Telugu songwriting) was a 15th-century Hindu saint, and is the earliest known Indian musician in Carnatic music to compose songs called sankirtanas in praise of the god Venkateswara.\n\nTo preserve the rich heritage of Annamayya compositions, Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam was taken up on an ambitious scale by the TTD and its propagation arms Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC) and Sri Venkateswara Recording Project (SVRP), designed by renowned film director K. Raghavendra Rao, a member of the TTD trust board. Music director M.M. Keeravani added grandeur to the program through his vital inputs.\n\nSinger Sunitha is the Anchor for this culturally unique show ever since the conception of the program. She also rendered the title song for this prestigious program series penned by lyricists Chandrabose, Ramajogayya Sastry, Anantha Sriram and composed by Sai Madhukar, Josya Bhatla. The program recorded 59 episodes in Season 1 and so far recorded 138 episodes in season 2 by composing and giving life to 1000 rare sankeerthanas out of 32,000 sankeertanas penned by Annamayya on the god Venkateswara (only about 12,000 are available today). Sunitha by herself rendered 140 sankeerthanas so far, offering them as her floral offerings to lord Venkateswara which includes the very first sankeerthana sung by her that unveils every new episode with a known popular composition. Here are the list of few Sankeerthanas recorded by Sunitha in Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam out of the 1000 compositions this program recorded:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Sankeerthana\n|-\n|Vevelaku nokate vinnapamide\n|-\n|Magaroopunu aadu roopu maaruchukoni riddaru\n|-\n|Okka maatu saranani undeninthe kaaka\n|-\n|Ratibatima sesina ramachandra nee chetiloni daananinte\n|-\n|Yemanunnado nee chittameraga nenu\n|-\n|Yenta gaaravinchevo yemi baathimi neeku\n|-\n|Aatadevvaadu choopare ammalaala\n|-\n|Naa valla kadama ledu nammithi ninnu\n|-\n|Aatade yeragadaa aakelaagu raati gunde thoda\n|-\n|Annita nerparivi neevaaduvayya\n|-\n|Panigona nerchu vaari bhaagyamu koladedi\n|-\n|Maatalaada nerani ramanivo nenu\n|-\n|Cheluvuda choodumaa ee cheliya singaaramu\n|-\n|Maguva nenu neevu magavaadavu\n|-\n|Idivo idivo inthata varambeevayya\n|}\nAnnamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam was also performed live in cities like Tirupathi, Vishakapatnam with the name Vishaka teeramlo vishnupadaarchana, Vijayawada with the name Ammavaari sannidhilo annamayya swaraarchana which are as well hosted by Sunitha along with performing and offering few keerthanas from her voice. Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam after gaining its popularity was also aired in Star MAA TV channel.\n\n==== Vengamaamba Keerthanalu ====\nTarigonda Vengamamba was a poet and staunch devotee of Lord Venkateswara in the 18th century. Her first poem was Tarikonda Nrusimha Satakam and it was followed by Nrusimha Vilasa Katha, Siva Natakam and Balakrishna Natakam as Yakshaganam and Rajayogamrutha Saram, a Dwipada Kavyam, Vishnu Parijatham, Chenchu Natakam, Rukmini Natakam, Jala Krida Vilasam, Mukthi Kanthi Vilasam (all Yaksha Ganams), Gopi Natakam (Golla Kalapam-Yakshaganam), Rama Parinayam, Sri Bhagavatham, Sri Krishna Manjari, Tatva Keerthanalu and Vashista Ramayanam (Dwipada), Sri Venkataachala Mahatyam (Padya Prabhandam) and Ashtanga Yoga, Saram (Padyakruthi).\n\nTTD, focusing on the propagation of Lord Sri Venkateswara's Bhakti Tatva through the compositions of Annamacharya, Matrusri Tarigonda Vengamamba, Alwars and the Karnataka Haridasas, took up \"Vengamaamba Keerthanalu\" as one of its prestigious projects to compose and offer the rare works of Vengamaamba to the world of music and literature.\n\nSunitha was part of this prestigious project taken up by Sri Venkateswara Recording Project, which was established by TTD to group all its activities relating to recording. Apart from these compositions recorded by SVRP-TTD, Sunitha also rendered 7 keerthanas in the movie \"Vengamaamba\" directed by P. Udaya Bhaskar and music given by M.M. Keeravani.\n\n==== Naada Neerajanam, Tirumala Brahmotsavam ====\n\"Nada neerajanam\" is an oblation to lord in the form of performing one's own art form from Tirumala Graded artists. Artists from all over the world are invited to perform in Nadaneerajanam in a planned manner and offer their devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Venkateshwara through nadopasana(worship through music). They sing compositions of great saint poets, perform different traditional dance forms as a seva(worship) to \"Sakala kala bhushitudu Sri Venkateshwara Swamy varu\"(Lord Venkateshwara).\n\n\"Brahmotsavam\" is the most important annual f\u00eate celebrated at Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala. During the festival, the Utsava-murti (processional deity) of the presiding deity Lord Venkateswara, along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi, will be taken on a procession on different Vahanams on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple.The celebration attracts pilgrims and tourists from all parts of India and across the world. It is a holy cleansing ceremony in honor of Lord Brahma, and the one at Tirumala is by far the largest.\n\nSunitha Upadrasta was blessed to perform quiet a few times on the divine stage Nada Neeraajanam, as well while performing unjal(swing) seva and one other divine experiences of singing for the lord during Brahmotsavam on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple. She also anchored one of the rare new year celebrations in Tirumala chanting \"govinda naama\" on the eve of 31 December.\n\n==== Srivaari Sevalu ====\nEvery day is a festival day in Tirumala. On each specific day, the Lord of Lords blesses his devotees in a specific ritual during the week days. These rituals are categorized as weekly \"pujas\". Limited number of devotees are allowed to take part in these weekly sevas on the issuance of limited number of tickets. In an attempt to bring these weekly \"seva\" more closer to larger devotees, SVBC came up with a concept of performing the same weekly rituals as they get performed on Lord Venkateshwara's main deity on a replica \"set\" so that the recording could get aired in SVBC channel on every weekday. VISESHA PUJA (ON MONDAYS), ASHTADALA \u2013 PADA PADMAARADHANA (ON TUESDAYS), SAHASRA KALASABHISHEKAM (ON WEDNESDAYS), TIRUPPAVADA SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), POOLANGI SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), ABHISHEKAM (ON FRIDAYS)\n\nSunitha Upadrasta offered her vocals to Srivaari set sevalu program presented by SVBC for two of the weekly seva's and Srivaari sevalu samaahaaram song as well that goes with the lyrics \"Enni janmala punyamo neekinni sevalu cheyagaa\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Seva\n!Lyric\n|-\n|Friday \u2013 Abhishekam\n|Saptagiri shrunga mangala taranga divya gagana gangaa teerthamula\n|-\n|Tuesday \u2013 Ashtadala paadapadmaaraadhana\n|Managala karamaina prathi mangala vaaramuna\n|}\n\n==== Thyaagaraaja Utsavaalu ====\nTyagaraja Aradhana is the annual festival glorifying Telugu saint composer Tyagaraja. The festival is observed in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, primarily in Tiruvaiyaru, the place where Tyagaraja attained Samadhi.\n\nSunitha, at her very young age of 10 years, participated in Tyagaraja Aradhana Utsavalu along with her guru Sri Pemmaraju Surya Rao garu.\n\n==== Prashanthi Nilayam ====\nPrasanthi Nilayam, literally \"The Abode of Supreme Peace\", is the birthplace and the headquarter of the sacred mission of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. For His devotees, it is what Rome is to the Catholics and Mecca to the Muslims. For others, who step into this township out of curiosity or general interest, it is a seat of inner growth and learning that visitors describe as aweinspiring. Its draw lies in its power to nourish the soul and calm the mind. This sacred township welcomes thousands of spiritual seekers from every faith, and all corners of the globe each day, as they arrive to behold the sacred presence of Bhagawan Baba.\n\nSunitha presented devotional songs in the presence of Bhagawan on two different occasions. On Friday evening, 15 August 2008, She sang many light devotional songs and most of them were in Telugu. She was lost in the joy and ecstasy as she sang and Swami too was very happy listening to her. After she completed her planned quota of 6\u20137 songs, Swami asked her to sing some more. She sang one more and when Swami asked her to sing another, she seemed so very thrilled and happy. She also sang a Meera bhajan and finally concluded with Swami's bhajan, \"Giridhara Naagara Kunja Vihaari\" which everyone followed. Bhagawan had many words of encouragement for the singer and he very lovingly blessed her. The other concert in Prasanthi nilayam by Sunitha was on 19 November 2008 and this program too lasted for an hour.\n\n=== Acting ===\n\nSunitha played the lead role in her first short film ''Raagam'', directed by Sree Chaitu.

Only about 1,600 live in the wild (80% in Sichuan) along with about 300 in captivity in Chinese breeding centers and zoos.  The animal is rare and elusive.  Though classified as an omnivore, the giant panda's diet is over 90% bamboo.  Its black and white coloration provides a degree camouflage in the dense forests, but the adult animal has no natural predators.  Giant pandas are notoriously difficult to breed; they have short mating periods, and give birth to only one or two cubs per year.  The giant panda cub is the smallest baby, compared in proportion to the parents, of any placental mammal.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 050, Hardcover Edition. {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>  The giant panda is considered to be a national treasure<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-plans-panda-preserve-times-size-yellowstone-park-46485424|title=ABC News|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> and is an endangered species protected by state law.  Since the 1970s, giant pandas have been given or lent to foreign zoos as [[Panda diplomacy|gesture of diplomatic goodwill]].\n\nOther more common bears in China include the [[Asiatic black bear]] and the [[brown bear]] which are found across much of the country.  Sub-species of the brown bear include the [[Himalayan brown bear]] and the [[Tibetan blue bear]] in Tibet, and the [[Ussuri brown bear]] in [[Heilongjiang]].  The [[sun bear]] is found in Yunnan. Bears, especially black bears, are also raised in captivity to harvest their [[bile bear|bile]] for use in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe [[red panda]], which unlike the giant panda is not a bear but a relative of the raccoon and weasel families, is found in Sichuan and Yunnan.\n\n====Viverridae and Herpestidae====\nThe [[viverrid]] and [[mongoose]] families of small carnivores are represented by numerous members occurring in southern China, including [[binturong]], [[large Indian civet]], [[small Indian civet]], [[Owston's palm civet]], [[masked palm civet]], [[Asian palm civet]], [[small-toothed palm civet]], [[crab-eating mongoose]] and [[small Indian mongoose]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Wozencraft, W.

All of these [[mustelids]] are short, furry animals with short, rounded ears and thick fur, but they differ markedly in size, habit and habitat.\n\nThe [[sable]], a species of marten, is prized for its fine fur, which along with ginseng and deer antler velvet, are known as the \"three treasures of Manchuria.\"  The sable is found in Manchuria (also called the Northeast) and Altai region of northern Xinjiang.  The [[beech marten]] of western China and [[yellow-throated marten]] of southern China are closely related to the sable.\n\nThe [[Siberian weasel]], known locally as the \"yellow rat wolf,\" is the most common weasel in China.  It is found throughout [[China Proper]] and [[Manchuria]], and known to steal poultry from farmers but helps to control the rodent population.  Hair from the tail of the Siberian weasel is used to make [[ink brush]] for traditional Chinese calligraphy.  Other weasel species include the [[least weasel]] and [[stoat]] in the north, [[yellow-bellied weasel]] and [[back-striped weasel]] in the south, and [[mountain weasel]] in the west.

The animal lives in caves and dens, which they do not dig but take from other animals such as bears, foxes and [[Bobak marmot]]s.  Wolverines are fierce creatures that will fight bears and wolves for food.

It is mentioned in historical records going back 2,000 years.  According to legend, the baiji dolphin is the reincarnation of a princess and called the \"Goddess of the Yangtze.\"  As recently as the 1950s, there were as many as 6,000 baiji dolphins in China, but their number fell to the hundreds by the 1980s, under 100 in the 1990s and fewer than a dozen since 2000.\n\nThe Yangtze River catchment area is one of the most densely populated areas in China and the world.  The river, China's longest, is also a major highway for ships.  Water and noise pollution, commercial fishing, and large propellers of ships are all major threats to the baiji.  The building of the [[Gezhouba Dam]] in the 1970s and the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in the 1990s blocked the access of the dolphins upstream, altered the seasonal flow of the river, and enabled large oceangoing ships to sail on the river.\n\nBy 1997, a survey of the river found only 13 baiji.  A [[Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition 2006|Sino-Swiss joint survey of the river]] from Yichang to Shanghai in 2006 found no animals and declared the species to be [[functionally extinct]], that is, even if a few individuals continued to survive, their numbers are too few to reproduce.  The last sighting confirmed by zoologist was in 2004 when a dead baiji dolphin washed ashore near [[Nanjing]].\n\nNature reserves to protect the baiji dolphin were established along the Yangtze in [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]] and [[Anhui]] province, along with observation and captive centers. The longest living baiji dolphin in captivity, Qiqi, lived in a [[dolphinarium]] in [[Wuhan]] from 1980 to 2002.  The [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve]], created out of an [[oxbow]] bend in the Yangtze was designed as a captive breeding area for the baiji.  One baiji was sent there in 1995 but died in 1996.  The reserve is now a breeding ground for the [[finless porpoise]].\n{{multiple image \n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1   = \n| width1    = 200\n| caption1  = [[Finless porpoise]]\n}}\n\n====Finless porpoise====\n[[File:Neophocaena phocaenoides DSC 03.jpg|thumb|Finless porpoise in [[Namhae (Sea)|Namhae Sea]], South Korea]]\nAt least two subspecies of [[finless porpoise]] are known to inhabit coastal waters such as off [[Dalian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.chinaso.com/thread-50141-1-1.html|title=\u5927\u8fde\uff1a\u5341\u4f59\u6c5f\u8c5a\u6c34\u4e2d\u6492\u6b22 \u88ab\u6d77\u9493\u8005\u62cd\u4e2a\u6b63\u7740-\u4e50\u6e38\u5929\u4e0b-\u56fd\u641c\u793e\u533a].

According to Chinese legend, this animal helped the ancient sage [[Jiang Ziya]] overthrow the [[King Zhou of Shang|tyrant king]] of the [[Shang Dynasty]] 4,000 years ago and became a symbol of good fortune.  Chinese emperors kept the ''sibuxiang'' also called ''milu'' in imperial hunting parks, even as the animal became extinct in the wild, perhaps as early as 2,000 years ago.  By 1866, when Father [[Armand David]] identified the animal, there were only 200\u2013300 remaining in the [[Milu Yuan|Nanhaizi Royal Park]] in [[Beijing]].  A few animals were sold to zoos in Europe before 1894, when the park was flooded and some of the animals escaped only to be hunted and eaten.  The last of the animals in China died during the chaos of the [[Boxer Rebellion]].  In 1898, [[Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford]] assembled a herd of 18 animals from European zoos and bred them at his estate, [[Woburn Abbey]] in England.  In 1985, 22 deer from this herd was reintroduced back to the Nanhaizi Park in Beijing and in 1986 another 39 were sent to [[Dafeng]], in northern Jiangsu on the [[Yellow Sea]].

The animal is raised as pets and for its tender flesh, fine fur and ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe [[marmot]], called ''hanta'' in Chinese for \"land\" or \"dry otter,\" is related to ground squirrels but are bigger, have shorter tails and are more social animals.  They can grow to be the size of a cat and live in large colonies.  Four species are found in China, all along the northern and western periphery of the country: [[gray marmot|gray]], [[Long-tailed marmot|long-tailed]], [[Himalayan marmot|Himalayan]], and [[tarbagan marmot|Tarbagan]].

The range of the Chinese zokor extends across north China from Qinghai to Beijing while that of the Rothschild's and Smith's zokors are confined to Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei and Qinghai.  The [[false zokor]] and [[Transbaikal zokor]] are found along China's border region with Russia and Mongolia.\n\nAll four bamboo rat species in the world are found in China: the [[Chinese bamboo rat]] south of the Yangtze, [[hoary bamboo rat]] in southwest China, [[large bamboo rat]] in [[Xishuangbanna]] in southern Yunnan and [[lesser bamboo rat]] and western Yunnan. The large bamboo rat can weigh as much as 5&nbsp;kg.  The flesh of the bamboo rat is rich in protein and low in fat.  Bamboo rat oil can be used to treat burn wounds.\n\nBoth the zokor and bamboo rat are farm-raised for their fur, meat and use in medicine.\n\n====Hamsters, lemmings, voles====\nAbout half of the world's 25 species of [[hamster]]s are found in China.

Only about 1,600 live in the wild (80% in Sichuan) along with about 300 in captivity in Chinese breeding centers and zoos.  The animal is rare and elusive.  Though classified as an omnivore, the giant panda's diet is over 90% bamboo.  Its black and white coloration provides a degree camouflage in the dense forests, but the adult animal has no natural predators.  Giant pandas are notoriously difficult to breed; they have short mating periods, and give birth to only one or two cubs per year.  The giant panda cub is the smallest baby, compared in proportion to the parents, of any placental mammal.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 050, Hardcover Edition. {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>  The giant panda is considered to be a national treasure<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-plans-panda-preserve-times-size-yellowstone-park-46485424|title=ABC News|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> and is an endangered species protected by state law.  Since the 1970s, giant pandas have been given or lent to foreign zoos as [[Panda diplomacy|gesture of diplomatic goodwill]].\n\nOther more common bears in China include the [[Asiatic black bear]] and the [[brown bear]] which are found across much of the country.  Sub-species of the brown bear include the [[Himalayan brown bear]] and the [[Tibetan blue bear]] in Tibet, and the [[Ussuri brown bear]] in [[Heilongjiang]].  The [[sun bear]] is found in Yunnan. Bears, especially black bears, are also raised in captivity to harvest their [[bile bear|bile]] for use in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe [[red panda]], which unlike the giant panda is not a bear but a relative of the raccoon and weasel families, is found in Sichuan and Yunnan.\n\n====Viverridae and Herpestidae====\nThe [[viverrid]] and [[mongoose]] families of small carnivores are represented by numerous members occurring in southern China, including [[binturong]], [[large Indian civet]], [[small Indian civet]], [[Owston's palm civet]], [[masked palm civet]], [[Asian palm civet]], [[small-toothed palm civet]], [[crab-eating mongoose]] and [[small Indian mongoose]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Wozencraft, W.

All of these [[mustelids]] are short, furry animals with short, rounded ears and thick fur, but they differ markedly in size, habit and habitat.\n\nThe [[sable]], a species of marten, is prized for its fine fur, which along with ginseng and deer antler velvet, are known as the \"three treasures of Manchuria.\"  The sable is found in Manchuria (also called the Northeast) and Altai region of northern Xinjiang.  The [[beech marten]] of western China and [[yellow-throated marten]] of southern China are closely related to the sable.\n\nThe [[Siberian weasel]], known locally as the \"yellow rat wolf,\" is the most common weasel in China.  It is found throughout [[China Proper]] and [[Manchuria]], and known to steal poultry from farmers but helps to control the rodent population.  Hair from the tail of the Siberian weasel is used to make [[ink brush]] for traditional Chinese calligraphy.  Other weasel species include the [[least weasel]] and [[stoat]] in the north, [[yellow-bellied weasel]] and [[back-striped weasel]] in the south, and [[mountain weasel]] in the west.

The animal lives in caves and dens, which they do not dig but take from other animals such as bears, foxes and [[Bobak marmot]]s.  Wolverines are fierce creatures that will fight bears and wolves for food.

It is mentioned in historical records going back 2,000 years.  According to legend, the baiji dolphin is the reincarnation of a princess and called the \"Goddess of the Yangtze.\"  As recently as the 1950s, there were as many as 6,000 baiji dolphins in China, but their number fell to the hundreds by the 1980s, under 100 in the 1990s and fewer than a dozen since 2000.\n\nThe Yangtze River catchment area is one of the most densely populated areas in China and the world.  The river, China's longest, is also a major highway for ships.  Water and noise pollution, commercial fishing, and large propellers of ships are all major threats to the baiji.  The building of the [[Gezhouba Dam]] in the 1970s and the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in the 1990s blocked the access of the dolphins upstream, altered the seasonal flow of the river, and enabled large oceangoing ships to sail on the river.\n\nBy 1997, a survey of the river found only 13 baiji.  A [[Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition 2006|Sino-Swiss joint survey of the river]] from Yichang to Shanghai in 2006 found no animals and declared the species to be [[functionally extinct]], that is, even if a few individuals continued to survive, their numbers are too few to reproduce.  The last sighting confirmed by zoologist was in 2004 when a dead baiji dolphin washed ashore near [[Nanjing]].\n\nNature reserves to protect the baiji dolphin were established along the Yangtze in [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]] and [[Anhui]] province, along with observation and captive centers. The longest living baiji dolphin in captivity, Qiqi, lived in a [[dolphinarium]] in [[Wuhan]] from 1980 to 2002.  The [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve]], created out of an [[oxbow]] bend in the Yangtze was designed as a captive breeding area for the baiji.  One baiji was sent there in 1995 but died in 1996.  The reserve is now a breeding ground for the [[finless porpoise]].\n{{multiple image \n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1   = \n| width1    = 200\n| caption1  = [[Finless porpoise]]\n}}\n\n====Finless porpoise====\n[[File:Neophocaena phocaenoides DSC 03.jpg|thumb|Finless porpoise in [[Namhae (Sea)|Namhae Sea]], South Korea]]\nAt least two subspecies of [[finless porpoise]] are known to inhabit coastal waters such as off [[Dalian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.chinaso.com/thread-50141-1-1.html|title=\u5927\u8fde\uff1a\u5341\u4f59\u6c5f\u8c5a\u6c34\u4e2d\u6492\u6b22 \u88ab\u6d77\u9493\u8005\u62cd\u4e2a\u6b63\u7740-\u4e50\u6e38\u5929\u4e0b-\u56fd\u641c\u793e\u533a].

This deer, colloquially known as the ''sibuxiang'' or the \"Four-Not-Look-Alike\", is said to have the hooves of an ox, antlers of a deer, neck of a camel and tail of a donkey, but does not look like any one animal.  According to Chinese legend, this animal helped the ancient sage [[Jiang Ziya]] overthrow the [[King Zhou of Shang|tyrant king]] of the [[Shang Dynasty]] 4,000 years ago and became a symbol of good fortune.  Chinese emperors kept the ''sibuxiang'' also called ''milu'' in imperial hunting parks, even as the animal became extinct in the wild, perhaps as early as 2,000 years ago.  By 1866, when Father [[Armand David]] identified the animal, there were only 200\u2013300 remaining in the [[Milu Yuan|Nanhaizi Royal Park]] in [[Beijing]].  A few animals were sold to zoos in Europe before 1894, when the park was flooded and some of the animals escaped only to be hunted and eaten.  The last of the animals in China died during the chaos of the [[Boxer Rebellion]].  In 1898, [[Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford]] assembled a herd of 18 animals from European zoos and bred them at his estate, [[Woburn Abbey]] in England.  In 1985, 22 deer from this herd was reintroduced back to the Nanhaizi Park in Beijing and in 1986 another 39 were sent to [[Dafeng]], in northern Jiangsu on the [[Yellow Sea]].  In 1998, eight animals in the latter herd were introduced into wilderness of the Dafeng Milu National Wildlife Reserve.

The animal is raised as pets and for its tender flesh, fine fur and ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe [[marmot]], called ''hanta'' in Chinese for \"land\" or \"dry otter,\" is related to ground squirrels but are bigger, have shorter tails and are more social animals.  They can grow to be the size of a cat and live in large colonies.  Four species are found in China, all along the northern and western periphery of the country: [[gray marmot|gray]], [[Long-tailed marmot|long-tailed]], [[Himalayan marmot|Himalayan]], and [[tarbagan marmot|Tarbagan]].

The range of the Chinese zokor extends across north China from Qinghai to Beijing while that of the Rothschild's and Smith's zokors are confined to Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei and Qinghai.  The [[false zokor]] and [[Transbaikal zokor]] are found along China's border region with Russia and Mongolia.\n\nAll four bamboo rat species in the world are found in China: the [[Chinese bamboo rat]] south of the Yangtze, [[hoary bamboo rat]] in southwest China, [[large bamboo rat]] in [[Xishuangbanna]] in southern Yunnan and [[lesser bamboo rat]] and western Yunnan. The large bamboo rat can weigh as much as 5&nbsp;kg.  The flesh of the bamboo rat is rich in protein and low in fat.  Bamboo rat oil can be used to treat burn wounds.\n\nBoth the zokor and bamboo rat are farm-raised for their fur, meat and use in medicine.\n\n====Hamsters, lemmings, voles====\nAbout half of the world's 25 species of [[hamster]]s are found in China.

The [[Greater bamboo bat|greater]] and [[lesser bamboo bat]]s prefer to roost inside the hollow shoots of giant bamboo through holes eaten by beetles.  Because the holes are small, bamboo bats are also tiny.  An adult lesser bamboo bat that measures {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weighs {{convert|3.5|to|5.8|g|oz|abbr=on}}, is not much bigger than a [[bumble bee]].\n\n[[House bat]]s including the [[Gobi big brown bat]], [[northern bat]], [[thick-eared bat]], [[serotine bat]] are also closely related to pipistrelles, noctules and barbastelles.
