The caption reads: ''That salary grab\u2014\"You took it\"''. Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 27 December 1873]]\n\nThe '''Salary Grab Act''', officially known as the '''Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Expenses Appropriation Act''',<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=017/llsl017.db&recNum=19 ''A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875'', p. xxvii]</ref> was passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1873 and sparked a firestorm of controversy among members of the government, the general public, and the press. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for [[George Washington]]. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, [[Ohio]] ratified what became the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]]. The controversy surrounding the bill resulted in Republicans losing many seats, resulting in a Democratic majority in the House which began one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history.<ref name=\"Dean\">[[#dean|Dean, 2002, legal essay at FindLaw]]</ref><ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]]</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Salary Grab Act cartoon.jpg|left|thumb|Salary Grab Act cartoon, featuring [[Horace Greely]] at left{{efn|The image depicts a well-dressed man at center, looking down on a impoverished man holding an itemized list labeled \"Monthly Expenses Clerk and Family\" which shows that the man comes up $46.00 short each month, next to him on a chair is another itemized list labeled \"Washington Price List\" outlining the costs of various food items, lodging, and fuel.

The president's salary, at $25,000 a year, had not increased since [[George Washington]] was president, while the value of the dollar didn't have the same purchasing power.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 402</ref><ref name=jenkins678>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 678</ref><ref>[[#brands|Brands, 2012]], p. 514</ref> Congressional salaries had not been increased since 1852.<ref>[[#smith|Smith, 2001]], 553</ref> While the government provided a house and a domestic staff for the president, Grant, like all presidents before him, paid for his own living expenses. Before passage of the act, salaries for members of Congress and Cabinet members were $5,000 and $8,000 respectively, significantly more than the wages for the average American.  Members of Congress were also supposed to pay for their own residences while in Washington, where rents had increased as much as 25% since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  When President Grant abolished the [[Franking#Franking privilege|franking privilege]], a considerable yearly sum for government officials who frequently corresponded, their expenses increased further.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], pp. 402\u2013403</ref> Professional needs also prompted the effort to increase salaries for government officials. Members of Congress were not provided by the government with a professional staff. Thus any member who employed administrators or personal clerks had to pay them directly out of his own pocket. Any member who was not financially well-off and needed clerical assistance was faced with a financial hardship, as Washington was a very expensive place in which to live.<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 677</ref> To meet the cost of living many government officials were forced to take on other forms of employment on the side, often resuming their former professions, usually between Congressional sessions.<ref name=jenkins678/><ref name=calhoun403>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 403</ref>\n\n===Emergence of the salary act===\nThe idea of increasing the salaries for government officials with legislation that became known as the \"Salary Grab\" was conceived in the final days of the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]], during the normal course of congressional business, and was first introduced on February 7, 1873, in the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Benjamin Butler]], a [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] Republican{{efn|The Stalwarts had close ties to the Grant administration. Best known among the Stalwarts were Butler, Carpenter, and [[Roscoe Conkling]]. Their principle rivals were the so called \"Half Breeds\", moderate Republicans led by [[James Blaine]].<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 683</ref>}} from Massachusetts.<ref name=jenkins678/><ref name=calhoun403/> The so called \"Salary Grab Act\"  first attracted attention on February 7, 1873, put forth by Butler, from Massachusetts, who on that day stated that he had been directed by the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] to submit a bill lending itself to the subject of salaries in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, along with a report in writing from Butler, who stated, \"I desire to say that the report is not drawn by myself, but I present it by order of the committee, and I concur in its statements.\" The bill was received and read aloud twice, and submitted. On February 10, Butler motioned that the Committee on Appropriations be directed to include the salary increase in the Miscellaneous Appropriation Bill, for the committee's consideration. Butler also moved for a suspension of the rules in order to allow that this motion be entertained by the committee.<ref>[[#robinson|Robinson, 1873]], p. 8</ref>\n\nThe amendment specified that the annual salary for Presidents, which at the time had remained unchanged since the presidency of George Washington, would double to $50,000, while the annual salaries of Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet members would increase to $10,000, and the annual salaries of civil servants would also increase.  Moreover, members of Congress would receive a pay increase from $5,000 to $7,500 annually.<ref name=jenkins674>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 674</ref> The congressional increase would be retroactive to the beginning of the 42nd Congress, almost two full years earlier.<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], pp. 680\u2013691</ref> This meant that all members of Congress would receive a lump sum payment of roughly $4,000 for \"services rendered\" when the session came to a close. The House, on 24 February 1873, assembled to conduct the routine procedure of working out a legislative appropriations bill.<ref name=jenkins678/>\n\nBoth Houses acted immediately and passed the conference bill; the House by a 102\u201395 vote, and the Senate by a 36\u201327 vote, whereafter President Grant signed the bill into law on March 3, 1873, the final day of the 42nd Congress. In little time the proposed salary increase in congressional salaries became a controversial issue in all branches of government as well as with much of the general public and the press.{{efn|'''Press coverage:''' <!--\n----------------------------- Press coverage ------------------------------------------ -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The National Republican Convention |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43796104/ |work=The Democratic Press| page=2 |location=Ravenna, Ohio|date=4 September 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=npc}} <!-- <ref>[[#tdp| The National Republican Convention, September 4, 1873, p. 2</ref. \n-->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Congressional Pay Raises |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43803709/  |work=The Evening Sun| page=12 |location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=12 June 1945 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}  |ref=tes }} <!--<ref>[[#tes|''The Evening Sun'', June 12, 1945, p. 12]]</ref> \n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Notes and Comments |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43771783/ |work=Argus and Patriot| page =7 |location=Montpelier, Vermont|date=11 December 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=aap }} <!-- <ref>[[#aap|Argus and Patriot, December 11, 1873]], p. 7</ref>\n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Party of Frauds |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43772160/ |work=The American Citizen| page=1 |location=Canton, Mississippi|date=20 September 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tac}} <!-- <ref>[[#tac|''The American Citizen'', September 20, 1873]], p. 1</ref> \n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title='Grabs' and 'Steals' |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43776466/ |work= The Daily Evening Express| page =7 |location=Lancaster, Pennsylvania|date=7 May 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=express}} <!-- <ref>[[#express|The Daily Evening Express, May 7, 1873]], p. 7</ref> \n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Salary Grab |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43774190/ |work= The Clarion-Ledger| page=1 |location=Jackson, Mississippi |date=24 July 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}  |ref=clarion }} <!-- [[#clarion|The Claroipn Ledger, July 24, 1873]], p. 1</ref> \n -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Grant's 'Salary Grab' Act |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43805013/ |work=The Journal and Tribune |page=28 |location= Knoxville, Tennessee |date=January 13, 1907 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tribune28}} <!-- </ref> [[#tribune28|The Journal and Tribune, January 13, 1907]], p. 28</ref> \n -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Political Scandals Which Brought Ruin |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43791710/ |work= The Journal and Tribune |page=7 |location=Knoxville, Tennessee |date=13 January 1907 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tribune7}} <!-- <ref>[[#tribune7|The Journal and Tribune, January 13, 1907]], p. 7</ref> -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Last Salary Grab |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44032685/the_new_york_times/ |work=The New York Times |page=22 |date=November 10, 1901 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tribune7}}}} <!-- <ref>[[#tribune7|The Journal and Tribune, January 13, 1907]], p. 22</ref>   -->\n<!--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n-->The newspapers immediately characterized the pay raise as the \"Salary Grab Act\" and associated its promotion to the recent [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal|Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]] scandal,<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], pp. 674, 680</ref> and accused the governing Republican majority in Congress of perpetuating an atmosphere of corruption.<ref name=jenkins674/> Most of the criticism, especially from Liberal reformers, was aimed at Republicans.<ref>[[#tac|''The American Citizen'', 20 September 1873]], p. 1</ref>  Along with the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal, the so-called Salary Grab Act or \"Salary steal\" fueled a widespread notion that the party in power was hopelessly corrupt.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 462</ref><ref name=jenkins678/>  However, the connection of the Liberals with the \"salary grab\" was easily open to criticism. Four Liberal senators and one representative supported the salary increases, and never returned their back pay.<ref>[[#ross|Ross, 1919]], p. 195</ref>\n\n[[Elihu Washburne]], Minister to France, who was a Republican himself and former ally of Grant, writing from Paris, characterized Congress as \"simply a gang of thieves...what a pity the President did not veto the salary steal\". President Grant reasoned that blocking the bill would have rendered all three branches of government underfunded, requiring the new 43rd Congress to conduct a special session to start the process all over again.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 403</ref> Due to the large public outcry, and in an attempt to deflect criticism, a few of the Senators and Representatives returned their bonuses to the United States government Treasury Department, while others donated it to colleges or charities. However, the criticism persisted, and the Republicans lost ninety-six seats in the House, including Butler. The huge loss resulted in the Democratic party returning to prominence for the first time since before the Civil War. As a result, the [[1874 and 1875 United States Senate elections|1874 election]] initiated one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history, lasting more than twenty years. During the opening of the next Congress, 20 January 1874, House members repealed the Appropriation Act, sustaining only the salary increases for the President and Supreme Court Justices, while all others abandoned any hope of a continuing salary increase.<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 681</ref><ref>[[#theriault|Theriault, 2005]], p. 17</ref><ref>[[#tes|''The Evening Sun'', 12 June 1945, p. 12]]</ref>                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Presidency of Ulysses S.

Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 27 December 1873]]\n\nThe '''Salary Grab Act''', officially known as the '''Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Expenses Appropriation Act''',<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=017/llsl017.db&recNum=19 ''A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875'', p. xxvii]</ref> was passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1873 and sparked a firestorm of controversy among members of the government, the general public, and the press. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for [[George Washington]]. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, [[Ohio]] ratified what became the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]]. The controversy surrounding the bill resulted in Republicans losing many seats, resulting in a Democratic majority in the House which began one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history.<ref name=\"Dean\">[[#dean|Dean, 2002, legal essay at FindLaw]]</ref><ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]]</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Salary Grab Act cartoon.jpg|left|thumb|Salary Grab Act cartoon, featuring [[Horace Greely]] at left{{efn|The image depicts a well-dressed man at center, looking down on a impoverished man holding an itemized list labeled \"Monthly Expenses Clerk and Family\" which shows that the man comes up $46.00 short each month, next to him on a chair is another itemized list labeled \"Washington Price List\" outlining the costs of various food items, lodging, and fuel.

The president's salary, at $25,000 a year, had not increased since [[George Washington]] was president, while the value of the dollar didn't have the same purchasing power.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 402</ref><ref name=jenkins678>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 678</ref><ref>[[#brands|Brands, 2012]], p. 514</ref> Congressional salaries had not been increased since 1852.<ref>[[#smith|Smith, 2001]], 553</ref> While the government provided a house and a domestic staff for the president, Grant, like all presidents before him, paid for his own living expenses. Before passage of the act, salaries for members of Congress and Cabinet members were $5,000 and $8,000 respectively, significantly more than the wages for the average American.  Members of Congress were also supposed to pay for their own residences while in Washington, where rents had increased as much as 25% since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  When President Grant abolished the [[Franking#Franking privilege|franking privilege]], a considerable yearly sum for government officials who frequently corresponded, their expenses increased further.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], pp. 402\u2013403</ref> Professional needs also prompted the effort to increase salaries for government officials. Members of Congress were not provided by the government with a professional staff. Thus any member who employed administrators or personal clerks had to pay them directly out of his own pocket. Any member who was not financially well-off and needed clerical assistance was faced with a financial hardship, as Washington was a very expensive place in which to live.<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 677</ref> To meet the cost of living many government officials were forced to take on other forms of employment on the side, often resuming their former professions, usually between Congressional sessions.<ref name=jenkins678/><ref name=calhoun403>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 403</ref>\n\n===Emergence of the salary act===\nThe idea of increasing the salaries for government officials with legislation that became known as the \"Salary Grab\" was conceived in the final days of the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]], during the normal course of congressional business, and was first introduced on February 7, 1873, in the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Benjamin Butler]], a [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] Republican{{efn|The Stalwarts had close ties to the Grant administration. Best known among the Stalwarts were Butler, Carpenter, and [[Roscoe Conkling]]. Their principle rivals were the so called \"Half Breeds\", moderate Republicans led by [[James Blaine]].<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 683</ref>}} from Massachusetts.<ref name=jenkins678/><ref name=calhoun403/> The so called \"Salary Grab Act\"  first attracted attention on February 7, 1873, put forth by Butler, from Massachusetts, who on that day stated that he had been directed by the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] to submit a bill lending itself to the subject of salaries in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, along with a report in writing from Butler, who stated, \"I desire to say that the report is not drawn by myself, but I present it by order of the committee, and I concur in its statements.\" The bill was received and read aloud twice, and submitted. On February 10, Butler motioned that the Committee on Appropriations be directed to include the salary increase in the Miscellaneous Appropriation Bill, for the committee's consideration. Butler also moved for a suspension of the rules in order to allow that this motion be entertained by the committee.<ref>[[#robinson|Robinson, 1873]], p. 8</ref>\n\nThe amendment specified that the annual salary for Presidents, which at the time had remained unchanged since the presidency of George Washington, would double to $50,000, while the annual salaries of Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet members would increase to $10,000, and the annual salaries of civil servants would also increase.  Moreover, members of Congress would receive a pay increase from $5,000 to $7,500 annually.<ref name=jenkins674>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 674</ref> The congressional increase would be retroactive to the beginning of the 42nd Congress, almost two full years earlier.<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], pp. 680\u2013691</ref> This meant that all members of Congress would receive a lump sum payment of roughly $4,000 for \"services rendered\" when the session came to a close. The House, on 24 February 1873, assembled to conduct the routine procedure of working out a legislative appropriations bill.<ref name=jenkins678/>\n\nBoth Houses acted immediately and passed the conference bill; the House by a 102\u201395 vote, and the Senate by a 36\u201327 vote, whereafter President Grant signed the bill into law on March 3, 1873, the final day of the 42nd Congress. In little time the proposed salary increase in congressional salaries became a controversial issue in all branches of government as well as with much of the general public and the press.{{efn|'''Press coverage:''' <!--\n----------------------------- Press coverage ------------------------------------------ -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The National Republican Convention |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43796104/ |work=The Democratic Press| page=2 |location=Ravenna, Ohio|date=4 September 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=npc}} <!-- <ref>[[#tdp| The National Republican Convention, September 4, 1873, p. 2</ref. \n-->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Congressional Pay Raises |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43803709/  |work=The Evening Sun| page=12 |location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=12 June 1945 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}  |ref=tes }} <!--<ref>[[#tes|''The Evening Sun'', June 12, 1945, p. 12]]</ref> \n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Notes and Comments |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43771783/ |work=Argus and Patriot| page =7 |location=Montpelier, Vermont|date=11 December 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=aap }} <!-- <ref>[[#aap|Argus and Patriot, December 11, 1873]], p. 7</ref>\n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Party of Frauds |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43772160/ |work=The American Citizen| page=1 |location=Canton, Mississippi|date=20 September 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tac}} <!-- <ref>[[#tac|''The American Citizen'', September 20, 1873]], p. 1</ref> \n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title='Grabs' and 'Steals' |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43776466/ |work= The Daily Evening Express| page =7 |location=Lancaster, Pennsylvania|date=7 May 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=express}} <!-- <ref>[[#express|The Daily Evening Express, May 7, 1873]], p. 7</ref> \n -->\n*{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Salary Grab |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43774190/ |work= The Clarion-Ledger| page=1 |location=Jackson, Mississippi |date=24 July 1873 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}  |ref=clarion }} <!-- [[#clarion|The Claroipn Ledger, July 24, 1873]], p. 1</ref> \n -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Grant's 'Salary Grab' Act |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43805013/ |work=The Journal and Tribune |page=28 |location= Knoxville, Tennessee |date=January 13, 1907 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tribune28}} <!-- </ref> [[#tribune28|The Journal and Tribune, January 13, 1907]], p. 28</ref> \n -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Political Scandals Which Brought Ruin |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43791710/ |work= The Journal and Tribune |page=7 |location=Knoxville, Tennessee |date=13 January 1907 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tribune7}} <!-- <ref>[[#tribune7|The Journal and Tribune, January 13, 1907]], p. 7</ref> -->\n* {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Last Salary Grab |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44032685/the_new_york_times/ |work=The New York Times |page=22 |date=November 10, 1901 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} |ref=tribune7}}}} <!-- <ref>[[#tribune7|The Journal and Tribune, January 13, 1907]], p. 22</ref>   -->\n<!--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n-->The newspapers immediately characterized the pay raise as the \"Salary Grab Act\" and associated its promotion to the recent [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal|Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]] scandal,<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], pp. 674, 680</ref> and accused the governing Republican majority in Congress of perpetuating an atmosphere of corruption.<ref name=jenkins674/> Most of the criticism, especially from Liberal reformers, was aimed at Republicans.<ref>[[#tac|''The American Citizen'', 20 September 1873]], p. 1</ref>  Along with the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal, the so-called Salary Grab Act or \"Salary steal\" fueled a widespread notion that the party in power was hopelessly corrupt.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 462</ref><ref name=jenkins678/>  However, the connection of the Liberals with the \"salary grab\" was easily open to criticism.

President Grant reasoned that blocking the bill would have rendered all three branches of government underfunded, requiring the new 43rd Congress to conduct a special session to start the process all over again.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun, 2017]], p. 403</ref> Due to the large public outcry, and in an attempt to deflect criticism, a few of the Senators and Representatives returned their bonuses to the United States government Treasury Department, while others donated it to colleges or charities. However, the criticism persisted, and the Republicans lost ninety-six seats in the House, including Butler. The huge loss resulted in the Democrat party returning to prominence for the first time since before the Civil War. As a result, the [[1874 and 1875 United States Senate elections|1874 election]] initiated one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history, lasting more than twenty years. During the opening of the next Congress, 20 January 1874, House members repealed the Appropriation Act, sustaining only the salary increases for the President and Supreme Court Justices, while all others abandoned any hope of a continuing salary increase.<ref>[[#jstor1|Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006]], p. 681</ref><ref>[[#theriault|Theriault, 2005]], p. 17</ref><ref>[[#tes|''The Evening Sun'', 12 June 1945, p. 12]]</ref>                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Presidency of Ulysses S.

It stars [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], [[Leonard Rossiter]] and [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]]. The film recounts the early exploits and later unravelling of a fictional 18th-century Irish rogue and opportunist who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position.\n\nKubrick began production on Barry Lyndon after his 1971 film, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Kubrick had originally intended to direct a [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects|biopic]] on [[Napoleon]], but lost his financing because of the commercial failure of a similar film, ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]''. Kubrick eventually directed Barry Lyndon, set during the [[Seven Years' War]], utilising his research from his Napoleon project. Filming lasted roughly 8 months, beginning in December 1973, and took place in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and [[West Germany]].\n \nThe film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long [[Two shot|double shots]], usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the settings based on [[William Hogarth]] paintings.

The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.\n\nBarry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation to a duel, when Barry shoots Quin. In the aftermath, he flees from the police towards Dublin, and is robbed by [[James Freney|Captain Feeney]], a [[highwayman]].\n\nDejected, Barry joins the British Army. Some time after, he encounters Captain Grogan, a family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not kill Quin, and that his dueling pistol had only been loaded with [[Tow (fibre)|tow]]. The duel was staged by Nora's family to get rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.\n\nBarry's regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the [[Seven Years' War]], where Grogan is fatally wounded in a [[Skirmisher|skirmish]] preliminary to the [[Battle of Minden]]. Fed up with the war, Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers after discovering the officer is homosexual. En route to neutral Holland, Barry encounters Frau Lieschen, a young German woman whose lover left for the war and never returned. Lieschen feeds and houses Barry. The two briefly become lovers. After leaving, Barry encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British, where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the [[Prussian Army]]. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from [[Frederick the Great]] for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.\n\nTwo years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become a servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, an itinerant professional gambler. The Prussians suspect that the Chevalier is an Irish spy in the service of the Austrians, and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry is overcome with emotion upon meeting a fellow Irishman, and reveals himself to the Chevalier immediately. They become confederates at the card table, where Barry and his fine eyesight relay information to the Chevalier. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of T\u00fcbingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier of cheating (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Potzdorf and other Prussian army officers.\n\nOver the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon. He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon. Because Lyndon is frail, sickly, and old, Barry's goading and verbal repartee ultimately send him into a fit of convulsions that ends with his death. Barry's coup-de-grace is the assertion that \"[[Last man|he who laughs last, wins]]\".\n\n===Part II===\n:''Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon''\n[[File:Marisa Berenson and Ryan O'Neal in Barry Lyndon.jpg|thumb|Barry's first meeting with Lady Lyndon]]\nIn 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a \"common opportunist\" who does not truly love his mother. Barry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic physical abuse. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.\n\nSome years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate. She warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. To further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. All this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon. A now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother. Barry viciously assaults Bullingdon until he is physically restrained by the guests. This loses Barry the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked to entreat and he is cast out of polite society. Nevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England.\n\nIn contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure. He cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. Defying his parents' direct instructions that he ride the horse only in the presence of his father, the spoiled Bryan is thrown from the horse, paralyzed, and dies a couple of days later from his injuries.\n\nThe grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Left in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition. Plunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself violently ill). The Reverend and the family's accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|satisfaction]] for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.\n\nThe duel with pistols is held in a [[tithe barn]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kubrick: The Definitive Edition|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=apbst3-ZYNoC|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2003-09-01|access-date = 2015-04-19|isbn = 9780571211081|first = Michel|last = Ciment|first2 = Gilbert|last2 = Adair|first3 = Robert|last3 = Bononno|page = 175}}</ref> A coin toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Terrified, Bullingdon demands another chance before he vomits in fear. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously [[Delope|fires into the ground]], but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received \"satisfaction\". In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.\n\nWhile Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Lord Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an [[Life annuity|annuity]] of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return. Otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed. Defeated in mind and body, Barry accepts. Humiliated, he hobbles on crutches to a carriage.\n\nThe narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then once he was fully recovered, he traveled to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success). Barry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.\n\n===Epilogue===\n<blockquote>''It was in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.''</blockquote>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Suits.BarryLyndon.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']][[File:Barrylyndon.suits2.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']]\n\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael Hordern]] (''voice'') as Narrator\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Redmond Barry (later Redmond Barry Lyndon)\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Lady Lyndon\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as the Chevalier du Balibari\n* [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Captain Potzdorf\n* [[Gay Hamilton]] as Nora Brady\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as Captain Grogan\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Lord Ludd\n* [[Marie Kean]] as Belle, Barry's mother\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Reverend Samuel Runt\n* [[Frank Middlemass]] as Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon\n* [[Leon Vitali]] as Lord Bullingdon\n** [[Dominic Savage]] as young Bullingdon\n* [[Leonard Rossiter]] as Captain John Quin\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Lord Wendover\n* [[Anthony Sharp]] as Lord Hallam\n* [[Philip Stone]]  as Graham\n* [[David Morley (musician)|David Morley]] as Bryan Patrick Lyndon\n* [[Diana K\u00f6rner|Diana Koerner]] as Lieschen (German Girl)\n* [[Arthur O'Sullivan]] as Captain Feeney\n* [[Billy Boyle]] as Seamus Feeney\n* [[Jonathan Cecil]] as Lt.

Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, [[John Alcott]], appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel. Kubrick's daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]] also appears (in an uncredited role) as a guest at Bryan's birthday party.\n\nOther Kubrick featured regulars were Leonard Rossiter (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''), Steven Berkoff, Patrick Magee, Godfrey Quigley, Anthony Sharp and Philip Stone (''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'').

During pre-production, [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was released, and failed at the box office. Reconsidering, Kubrick's financiers pulled funding, and he turned his attention towards an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, \"At one time, ''Vanity Fair'' interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film ... as soon as I read ''Barry Lyndon'' I became very excited about it.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Michel|title=Kubrick on Barry Lyndon|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Ciment| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505010625/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHaving earned Oscar nominations for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'', Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of \"a perfectionist [[auteur]] who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\">Robey, Tim, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4524037/Barry-Lyndon-Kubricks-neglected-masterpiece.html \"Kubrick's Neglected Masterpiece\"], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] Review'' (31 January 2009), pp. 16\u201317</ref> His studio\u2014Warner Bros.\u2014was therefore \"eager to bankroll\" his next project, which Kubrick kept \"shrouded in secrecy\" from the press partly due to the furore surrounding the controversially violent ''A Clockwork Orange'' (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his \"long-standing [[paranoia]] about the [[tabloid press]].\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nHaving felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 \"[[satire|satirical]] picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue,\" ''Barry Lyndon'', the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research he had done for the now-aborted ''Napoleon''.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> At the time, Kubrick merely announced that his next film would star [[Ryan O'Neal]] (deemed \"a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>) and [[Marisa Berenson]], a former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover model<ref name=\"Grdn2019\">{{cite news |last1=Saner |first1=Emine |title='I did the first nude in Vogue': Marisa Berenson on being a blazing star of the 70s and beyond: Interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/30/marisa-berenson-warhol-dali-vogue-cabaret |accessdate=25 November 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 October 2019}}</ref>, and be shot largely in Ireland.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that \"Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] took 300 days, from spring 1973 through to early 1974, with a break for Christmas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Making Time in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: Art, History, and Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0_I8BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic|date = 2014-12-18|isbn = 9781441167750|language = en|first = Maria|last = Pramaggiore}}</ref> The crew arrived in [[Dublin]], Ireland in May 1973.

In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th-century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing \"a lot to [[William Hogarth]], with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated.\"<ref name= \"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nThe film is widely regarded as having a stately, static, painterly quality,<ref name= \"TelegraphReview\"/> mostly due to its lengthy wide angle long shots. To illuminate the more notable interior scenes, artificial lights called \"Mini-Brutes\" were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do.  An example of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDespite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights.

The main theme explored in Barry Lyndon is one of fate and destiny. Barry is pushed through life by a series of key events, some of which seem unavoidable.

The narrator repeatedly emphasizes the role of fate as he announces events before they unfold on screen, like Brian's death and Bullingdon seeking satisfaction. This theme of fate is also developed in the reoccurring motif of the painting. Just like the events featured in the paintings, Barry is participating in events which always were. Another major theme is between father and son. Barry lost his father at a young age and throughout the film he seeks and attaches himself to father-figures. Examples include his uncle, Grogan, and the Chevalier. When given the chance to be a father, Barry loves his son to the point of spoiling him. This contrasts with his role as a father to Lord Bullingdon, whom he disregards and punishes.<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/32367/1/why-barry-lyndon-is-stanley-kubrick-s-seminal-masterpiece|title=Why Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubrick\u2019s secret masterpiece|last=Dazed|date=8 August 2016|website=Dazed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/barry-lyndon-review-stanley-kubrick-ryan-o-neal|title=Barry Lyndon review \u2013 Kubrick's intimate epic of utter lucidity|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=28 July 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n==Source novel==\nKubrick based his adapted screenplay on [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (republished as the novel ''Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.),'' a [[picaresque]] tale written and published in serial form in 1844.\n\nThe film departs from the novel in several ways. In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a raconteur and an [[unreliable narrator]]. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor [[Michael Hordern]]), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an omniscient narrator. Kubrick felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title=Visual memory | place = UK | type = interview |accessdate=2010-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210204149/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.}}\n\nKubrick made several changes to the plot, including the addition of the final duel.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1975]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* Tibbetts, John C., and James M.

It stars [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], [[Leonard Rossiter]] and [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]]. The film recounts the early exploits and later unravelling of a fictional 18th-century Irish rogue and opportunist who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position.\n\nKubrick began production on Barry Lyndon after his 1971 film, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Kubrick had originally intended to direct a [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects|biopic]] on [[Napoleon]], but lost his financing due to the commercial failure of a similar film, ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]''. Kubrick eventually directed Barry Lyndon, set during the [[Seven Years' War]], utilising his research from his Napoleon project. Filming lasted roughly 8 months, beginning in December 1973, and took place in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and [[West Germany]].\n \nThe film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long [[Two shot|double shots]], usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the settings based on [[William Hogarth]] paintings. The exteriors were filmed on location in Ireland, England and West Germany, with the interiors shot mainly in London. The production was troubled; there were problems related to logistics, weather, and even politics (Kubrick feared that he might be an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] hostage target), while the relationship between Kubrick and O'Neal was especially fraught and difficult.{{Citation needed|reason=This contradicts Kubrick's own claims (http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html)|date=August 2019}} O'Neal's perceived lack of on-screen depth and ability to portray a character arc have been repeatedly criticised; this perception was not shared by Kubrick, who subsequently praised O'Neal's performance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html | title= Kubrick speaks in regard to 'Barry Lyndon' | work=The Kubrick Site | date= | accessdate= 30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Barry Lyndon'' won four Oscars at the [[48th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. Although some critics took issue with the film's slow pace and restrained emotion, its reputation, like that of many of Kubrick's works, has strengthened over time, with many now regarding it as one of his greatest achievements.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part I===\n:''By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon''\n\nAn [[Omniscient narrator|omniscient]] (though possibly [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable]])<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Mark Crispin|title=Barry Lyndon Reconsidered|journal=The Georgia Review|year=1976|volume=XXX|issue=4|url= http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0086.html}}</ref> narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a [[duel]] over a sale of some horses. The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.\n\nBarry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation to a duel, when Barry shoots Quin. In the aftermath, he flees from the police towards Dublin, and is robbed by [[James Freney|Captain Feeney]], a [[highwayman]].\n\nDejected, Barry joins the British Army. Some time after, he encounters Captain Grogan, a family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not kill Quin, and that his dueling pistol had only been loaded with [[Tow (fibre)|tow]]. The duel was staged by Nora's family to get rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.\n\nBarry's regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the [[Seven Years' War]], where Grogan is fatally wounded in a [[Skirmisher|skirmish]] preliminary to the [[Battle of Minden]]. Fed up with the war, Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers after discovering the officer is homosexual. En route to neutral Holland, Barry encounters Frau Lieschen, a young German woman whose lover left for the war and never returned. Lieschen feeds and houses Barry. The two briefly become lovers. After leaving, Barry encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British, where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the [[Prussian Army]]. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from [[Frederick the Great]] for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.\n\nTwo years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become a servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, an itinerant professional gambler. The Prussians suspect that the Chevalier is an Irish spy in the service of the Austrians, and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry is overcome with emotion upon meeting a fellow Irishman, and reveals himself to the Chevalier immediately. They become confederates at the card table, where Barry and his fine eyesight relay information to the Chevalier. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of T\u00fcbingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier of cheating (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Potzdorf and other Prussian army officers.\n\nOver the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon. He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon. Because Lyndon is frail, sickly, and old, Barry's goading and verbal repartee ultimately send him into a fit of convulsions that ends with his death. Barry's coup-de-grace is the assertion that \"[[Last man|he who laughs last, wins]]\".\n\n===Part II===\n:''Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon''\n[[File:Marisa Berenson and Ryan O'Neal in Barry Lyndon.jpg|thumb|Barry's first meeting with Lady Lyndon]]\nIn 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a \"common opportunist\" who does not truly love his mother. Barry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic physical abuse. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.\n\nSome years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate. She warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. To further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. All this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon. A now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother. Barry viciously assaults Bullingdon until he is physically restrained by the guests. This loses Barry the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked to entreat and he is cast out of polite society. Nevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England.\n\nIn contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure. He cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. Defying his parents' direct instructions that he ride the horse only in the presence of his father, the spoiled Bryan is thrown from the horse, paralyzed, and dies a couple of days later from his injuries.\n\nThe grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Left in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition. Plunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself violently ill). The Reverend and the family's accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|satisfaction]] for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.\n\nThe duel with pistols is held in a [[tithe barn]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kubrick: The Definitive Edition|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=apbst3-ZYNoC|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2003-09-01|access-date = 2015-04-19|isbn = 9780571211081|first = Michel|last = Ciment|first2 = Gilbert|last2 = Adair|first3 = Robert|last3 = Bononno|page = 175}}</ref> A coin toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Terrified, Bullingdon demands another chance before he vomits in fear. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously [[Delope|fires into the ground]], but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received \"satisfaction\". In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.\n\nWhile Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Lord Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an [[Life annuity|annuity]] of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return. Otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed. Defeated in mind and body, Barry accepts. Humiliated, he hobbles on crutches to a carriage.\n\nThe narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then once he was fully recovered, he traveled to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success). Barry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.\n\n===Epilogue===\n<blockquote>''It was in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.''</blockquote>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Suits.BarryLyndon.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']][[File:Barrylyndon.suits2.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']]\n\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael Hordern]] (''voice'') as Narrator\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Redmond Barry (later Redmond Barry Lyndon)\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Lady Lyndon\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as the Chevalier du Balibari\n* [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Captain Potzdorf\n* [[Gay Hamilton]] as Nora Brady\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as Captain Grogan\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Lord Ludd\n* [[Marie Kean]] as Belle, Barry's mother\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Reverend Samuel Runt\n* [[Frank Middlemass]] as Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon\n* [[Leon Vitali]] as Lord Bullingdon\n** [[Dominic Savage]] as young Bullingdon\n* [[Leonard Rossiter]] as Captain John Quin\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Lord Wendover\n* [[Anthony Sharp]] as Lord Hallam\n* [[Philip Stone]]  as Graham\n* [[David Morley (musician)|David Morley]] as Bryan Patrick Lyndon\n* [[Diana K\u00f6rner|Diana Koerner]] as Lieschen (German Girl)\n* [[Arthur O'Sullivan]] as Captain Feeney\n* [[Billy Boyle]] as Seamus Feeney\n* [[Jonathan Cecil]] as Lt.

Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, [[John Alcott]], appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel.

During pre-production, [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was released, and failed at the box office. Reconsidering, Kubrick's financiers pulled funding, and he turned his attention towards an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, \"At one time, ''Vanity Fair'' interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film ... as soon as I read ''Barry Lyndon'' I became very excited about it.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Michel|title=Kubrick on Barry Lyndon|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Ciment| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505010625/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHaving earned Oscar nominations for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'', Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of \"a perfectionist [[auteur]] who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\">Robey, Tim, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4524037/Barry-Lyndon-Kubricks-neglected-masterpiece.html \"Kubrick's Neglected Masterpiece\"], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] Review'' (31 January 2009), pp. 16\u201317</ref> His studio\u2014Warner Bros.\u2014was therefore \"eager to bankroll\" his next project, which Kubrick kept \"shrouded in secrecy\" from the press partly due to the furore surrounding the controversially violent ''A Clockwork Orange'' (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his \"long-standing [[paranoia]] about the [[tabloid press]].\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nHaving felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 \"[[satire|satirical]] picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue,\" ''Barry Lyndon'', the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research he had done for the now-aborted ''Napoleon''.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> At the time, Kubrick merely announced that his next film would star [[Ryan O'Neal]] (deemed \"a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>) and [[Marisa Berenson]], a former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover model<ref name=\"Grdn2019\">{{cite news |last1=Saner |first1=Emine |title='I did the first nude in Vogue': Marisa Berenson on being a blazing star of the 70s and beyond: Interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/30/marisa-berenson-warhol-dali-vogue-cabaret |accessdate=25 November 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 October 2019}}</ref>, and be shot largely in Ireland.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that \"Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] took 300 days, from spring 1973 through to early 1974, with a break for Christmas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Making Time in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: Art, History, and Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0_I8BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic|date = 2014-12-18|isbn = 9781441167750|language = en|first = Maria|last = Pramaggiore}}</ref> The crew arrived in [[Dublin]], Ireland in May 1973.

In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th-century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing \"a lot to [[William Hogarth]], with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated.\"<ref name= \"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nThe film is widely regarded as having a stately, static, painterly quality,<ref name= \"TelegraphReview\"/> mostly due to its lengthy wide angle long shots. To illuminate the more notable interior scenes, artificial lights called \"Mini-Brutes\" were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do.  An example of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDespite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights.

The main theme explored in Barry Lyndon is one of fate and destiny. Barry is pushed through life by a series of key events, some of which seem unavoidable. As Roger Ebert says, \"He is a man to whom things happen.\"<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/barry-lyndon-1975|title=Barry Lyndon Movie Review & Film Summary (1975) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref> He declines to eat with the highwaymen Captain Feeney, where he would most likely have been robbed, but is robbed anyway farther down the road. The narrator repeatedly emphasizes the role of fate as he announces events before they unfold on screen, like Brian's death and Bullingdon seeking satisfaction. This theme of fate is also developed in the reoccurring motif of the painting. Just like the events featured in the paintings, Barry is participating in events which always were. Another major theme is between father and son. Barry lost his father at a young age and throughout the film he seeks and attaches himself to father-figures. Examples include his uncle, Grogan, and the Chevalier. When given the chance to be a father, Barry loves his son to the point of spoiling him. This contrasts with his role as a father to Lord Bullingdon, whom he disregards and punishes.<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/32367/1/why-barry-lyndon-is-stanley-kubrick-s-seminal-masterpiece|title=Why Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubrick\u2019s secret masterpiece|last=Dazed|date=8 August 2016|website=Dazed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/barry-lyndon-review-stanley-kubrick-ryan-o-neal|title=Barry Lyndon review \u2013 Kubrick's intimate epic of utter lucidity|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=28 July 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n==Source novel==\nKubrick based his adapted screenplay on [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (republished as the novel ''Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.),'' a [[picaresque]] tale written and published in serial form in 1844.\n\nThe film departs from the novel in several ways. In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a raconteur and an [[unreliable narrator]]. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor [[Michael Hordern]]), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an omniscient narrator. Kubrick felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title=Visual memory | place = UK | type = interview |accessdate=2010-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210204149/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.}}\n\nKubrick made several changes to the plot, including the addition of the final duel.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1975]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* Tibbetts, John C., and James M.

He founded [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]], a [[Trappist]] abbey in [[Leicestershire]], and worked for the reconversion or reconciliation of Britain to Catholicism.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was the son of [[Charles March-Phillipps]] of [[Garendon Hall]], Leicestershire, and Harriet Ducarel, daughter of [[Gerald Gustavus Ducarel ]] of [[Walford, Somerset]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=7457|first=Margaret|last=Pawley|title=Lisle, Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de}}</ref> The de Lisle family of Leicestershire were originally the Phillippses from London. The Garendon estate, near Loughborough, was inherited by Thomas March who adopted the name Phillipps, and married Susan de Lisles. Their son, Charles, adopted the de Lisle crest and arms. Steady accumulation of landed property made him one of the \u2018wealthiest commoners\u2019 in England. When Charles March-Phillipps died in 1862, Ambrose took the additional name of Lisle, becoming Ambrose Charles Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/march-phillipps-charles-1779-1862|title=MARCH PHILLIPPS, Charles (1779-1862), of Garendon Park, nr. Loughborough, Leics. {{!}} History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nHe spent his earliest years at his birthplace and was brought up as a member of the [[Church of England]], receiving his first religious instruction from his uncle, William March Phillipps, a [[High Church]] clergyman. In 1818 Ambrose was sent to a private school in [[South Croxton]], whence he was removed in 1820 to [[Maisemore]] Court School, near [[Gloucester]], kept by the Rev. [[George Hodson (priest)|George Hodson]]. The [[Bishop of Gloucester]], [[Henry Ryder]], having married Sophia March Phillipps, was his uncle by marriage, and so the boy spent Sundays and holidays at the bishop's palace.<ref name=Burton>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps De Lisle|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nAt school he met for the first time a Catholic, the Abb\u00e9 Giraud, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9 priest. A visit to Paris in 1823 gave him his first acquaintance with Catholic liturgy. The effect on his mind was shown on his return home when he persuaded the Anglican rector to place a cross<!--crucifix?--> on the communion table, but this first effort to restore the cross to English churches was stopped by [[Herbert Marsh|the Bishop of Peterborough]].  He converted to Catholicism, and immediately removed from Rev. Hodson's school, and returned home with his father, who arranged for him to continue his preparation for the university under the private tuition of the Rev. William Wilkinson. He was obliged every Sunday to attend the Anglican church, but did not join in the service.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nAmbrose Phillipps was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in November 1825,<ref>{{acad|id=D825AL|name=De Lisle (formerly Phillipps), Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps}}</ref> though he did not go into residence there until 16 October 1826. At the university he found a congenial friend in [[Kenelm Henry Digby|Kenelm Digby]], author of ''Mores Catholici'' and ''The Broadstone of Honour'', who was, like himself, a member of a long-established family of the [[gentry]] and a recent convert. There was no Catholic chapel then at Cambridge, and every Sunday for two years these two young Catholics used to ride, fasting, over to [[St Edmund's College, Ware]], a distance of twenty-five miles, for [[Catholic Mass]] and Communion. It was on one of these visits to St Edmund's, in April 1828, that Phillipps was seized with a serious illness, having broken a blood-vessel in his lung. The doctors recommended his father to take him to Italy for the winter, and this necessarily cut short his Cambridge career, so that he had to leave the university without taking his degree.(He could not have received it anyway, before [[Catholic Emancipation]].) On his return to England in 1829, he became acquainted with the [[Ignatius Spencer|Hon.

The second was the restoration of the primitive ecclesiastical chant, my edition of which is now recommended by the Archbishop of Westminster for the use of churches and chapels. The third was the restoration of the Anglican Church to Catholic Unity.</blockquote>\n\n==Catholic revival==\n[[File:Mount St Bernards Abbey.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Mount St Bernard Abbey]]\nAccording to Purcell, \"In that early day no one did more for the Catholic revival in England, almost single-handed, than Phillipps de Lisle\".<ref name=\"Purcell\">{{Cite book|last=Purcell|first=Edmund Sheridan|url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924092447600|title=Life and letters of Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle|last2=De Lisle|first2=Edwin|date=1900|publisher=London, New York : Macmillan|others=Cornell University Library}}</ref>\n\nIn the foundation of the [[Cistercian]] [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]] in Leicestershire he received generous support from his friend John, [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], but it was he himself who conceived the idea, believing it necessary that the ascetic aspect of Catholic life should be presented to the English people. Mount St Bernard Abbey was the first monastery built in England since the Reformation.<ref name=Purcell/> He gave both land and money, severely depleting his own resources in providing the necessary buildings. This work was begun in 1835 and completed in 1844, while, during the same period, he founded missions at [[Grace-Dieu|Grace Dieu]] and [[Whitwick]]. His disappointment was great when he found that the [[Trappist]]s were prevented by their rule from undertaking active missionary work, because he attached the greatest importance to a supply of zealous missionary priests who would labour in English villages; he said, \"I would have them go about and preach everywhere on the foreign plan, in the fields or in the high roads even\".<ref>Letter to Lord Shrewsbury, 1839; ''Life'', I, p. 105</ref>\n\nIn 1838 he joined his friend Rev. George Spencer in establishing and propagating the Association of Universal Prayer for the Conversion of England. In a continental tour he and Spencer made together, accompanied by Mrs Phillipps and two of her children, in 1844, they passed through Belgium, Germany, and North Italy, meeting many distinguished Catholics and enlisting the sympathy of [[prelate]]s and clergy in the cause. [[Nicholas Wiseman]] was co-operating in Rome, and soon the movement spread widely through the Catholic world. He was for some time the only Catholic who was in confidential correspondence with the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], including [[John Henry Newman]], receiving them at Grace-Dieu.  He saw the Movement as a step towards his desire of reconciling the Anglican Church with Rome. As his son stated:<ref>''Life and Letters'', I, 254, note</ref> <blockquote>National Conversion by means of Corporate Reunion he likened unto the Apostolic practice of fishing with a net \"gathering in multitudes of all kinds of fishes\". And this he considered to be his own special call from on High, to prepare the way and hasten the time when the Divine Word should again be spoken to Peter, 'Cast your nets into the deep\".</blockquote>\n\n==Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom==\nHe welcomed the [[restoration of the English Catholic hierarchy]] in 1850, and tried to reconcile to it some of the Catholic laymen who thought it inexpedient. During the debates that ensued throughout the country he wrote two pamphlets: ''A Letter to Lord Shrewsbury on the Re-establishment of the Hierarchy and the Present Position of Catholic Affairs'', and ''A few words on Lord John Russell's Letter to the Bishop of Durham''. The progress of events raised his hopes so high that he regarded the reconciliation of the Anglican Church to the [[Holy See]] as imminent, and to hasten its fulfilment entered on a new crusade of prayer, in which the co-operation of non-Catholics was desired. The [[Association for Promoting the Unity of Christendom]] (A.P.U.C.) was founded on 8 September 1857, by fourteen people including Father Lockhart, Fr. Collins, O. Cist., and de Lisle; the rest were Anglicans, with one exception, a Russo-Greek priest.\n\nThe only obligation incumbent on members, who might be Catholics, Anglicans, or Greeks, was to pray to God for the unity of the baptised body. At first the association progressed rapidly. De Lisle wrote to [[John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland|Lord John Manners]] (''Life'', I, 415) saying, \"We soon counted among our ranks many Catholic Bishops and Archbishops and Dignitaries of all descriptions from Cardinals downwards; the Patriarch of Constantinople and other great Eastern prelates, the Primate of the Russlart Church. ...I do not think any Anglican Bishops joined us, but a large number of clergy of the second order.\" He gave the number of members as nine thousand. The formation of this association was, however, regarded with distrust by Dr. (later Cardinal) [[Henry Edward Manning|Manning]] and other Catholics, who also took exception to de Lisle's treatise ''On the Future Unity of Christendom''. The matter was referred to Rome and was finally settled by a papal rescript addressed ''Ad omnes episcopos Angli\u00e6'', dated 16 September 1864, which condemned the association and directed the bishops to take steps to prevent Catholics from joining it.\n\nThis was a great blow to de Lisle, who considered that \"the authorities had been deceived by a false relation of facts\".<ref>Letter to Editor of Union Review, 20 December 1864; ''Life'', I, 400</ref> He however withdrew his name from the A.P.U.C. \"under protest, as an act of submission to the Holy See\". The ground on which the association was condemned was that it subverted the Divine constitution of the Church, inasmuch as its aim rested on the supposition that the true Church consists partly of the Catholic Church in communion with Rome, \"partly also of the [[Photian Schism]] and the Anglican heresy, to which equally with the Roman Church belong the one Lord, the one faith and one baptism\" (Rescript, in ''Life'', I, 388). His own pamphlet was not censured, but the condemnation of the A.P.U.C. was regarded by him as the death-blow of his hopes for the reunion of Christendom during his own lifetime. However, his own belief in it persevered and influenced his views in other Catholic affairs. Thus he warmly supported the attendance of Catholics at the English universities, and he even approved of the abortive project of a Uniate English Church.\n\nThe rest of his life passed without any very special incident, though he continued ever to take an interest in public affairs as affecting the fortunes of the Church, and in the same connection he carried on intimate and cordial correspondence with men as different as Newman, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert|Count de Montalembert]]. He counted among his friends [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury|John, Earl of Shrewsbury]], Cardinal Wiseman, [[A. W. N. Pugin]], who provided designs for Grace-Dieu, [[Frederick William Faber]], and many other well-known Catholics, and though he differed on many points from Cardinal Manning and Dr. [[William George Ward|W.G. Ward]] he remained on friendly terms with both. He died at [[Garendon Hall|Garendon]], survived by his wife and eleven of his sixteen children.\n\nBesides the pamphlets that have been mentioned, his other published works include ''Mahometanism in its relation to Prophecy; or an Inquiry into the prophecies concerning Anti-Christ, with some reference to their bearing on the events of the present day'' (1855). He also translated [[Dominic Barberi]]'s ''Lamentations of England'' (1831); Manzoni's ''Vindication of Catholic Morality'' (1836); Montalembert's ''St Elizabeth of Hungary'' (1839); Rio's ''La petite Chouannerie'' (1842); ''Maxims and Examples of the Saints'' (1844); and he compiled: ''Manual of Devotion for the Confraternity of the Living Rosary'' (1843); ''Catholic Christian's Complete Manual'' (1847); ''The Little Gradual'' (1847); ''Thesaurus anim\u00e6 Christian\u00e6'' (1847); ''Sequenti\u00e6 de Festis per Annum'' (1862).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092447600#page/n9/mode/2up Purcell, Edmund Sheridan.

He founded [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]], a [[Trappist]] abbey in [[Leicestershire]], and worked for the reconversion or reconciliation of Britain to Catholicism.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was the son of [[Charles March-Phillipps]] of [[Garendon Hall]], Leicestershire, and Harriet Ducarel, daughter of [[Gerald Gustavus Ducarel ]] of [[Walford, Somerset]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=7457|first=Margaret|last=Pawley|title=Lisle, Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de}}</ref> The de Lisle family of Leicestershire were originally the Phillippses from London. The Garendon estate, near Loughborough, was inherited by Thomas March who adopted the name Phillipps, and married Susan de Lisles. Their son, Charles, adopted the de Lisle crest and arms. Steady accumulation of landed property made him one of the \u2018wealthiest commoners\u2019 in England. When Charles March-Phillipps died in 1862, Ambrose took the additional name of Lisle, becoming Ambrose Charles Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/march-phillipps-charles-1779-1862 \"March Phillipps, Charles (1779-1862), of Garendon Park\", The History of Parliament]</ref>\n\nHe spent his earliest years at his birthplace and was brought up as a member of the [[Church of England]], receiving his first religious instruction from his uncle, William March Phillipps, a [[High Church]] clergyman. In 1818 Ambrose was sent to a private school in [[South Croxton]], whence he was removed in 1820 to [[Maisemore]] Court School, near [[Gloucester]], kept by the Rev. [[George Hodson (priest)|George Hodson]]. The [[Bishop of Gloucester]], [[Henry Ryder]], having married Sophia March Phillipps, was his uncle by marriage, and so the boy spent Sundays and holidays at the bishop's palace.<ref name=Burton>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps De Lisle|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nAt school he met for the first time a Catholic, the Abb\u00e9 Giraud, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9 priest. A visit to Paris in 1823 gave him his first acquaintance with Catholic liturgy. The effect on his mind was shown on his return home when he persuaded the Anglican rector to place a cross<!--crucifix?--> on the communion table, but this first effort to restore the cross to English churches was stopped by [[Herbert Marsh|the Bishop of Peterborough]].  He converted to Catholicism, and immediately removed from Rev. Hodson's school, and returned home with his father, who arranged for him to continue his preparation for the university under the private tuition of the Rev. William Wilkinson. He was obliged every Sunday to attend the Anglican church, but did not join in the service.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nAmbrose Phillipps was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in November 1825,<ref>{{acad|id=D825AL|name=De Lisle (formerly Phillipps), Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps}}</ref> though he did not go into residence there until 16 October 1826. At the university he found a congenial friend in [[Kenelm Henry Digby|Kenelm Digby]], author of ''Mores Catholici'' and ''The Broadstone of Honour'', who was, like himself, a member of a long-established family of the [[gentry]] and a recent convert. There was no Catholic chapel then at Cambridge, and every Sunday for two years these two young Catholics used to ride, fasting, over to [[St Edmund's College, Ware]], a distance of twenty-five miles, for [[Catholic Mass]] and Communion. It was on one of these visits to St Edmund's, in April 1828, that Phillipps was seized with a serious illness, having broken a blood-vessel in his lung. The doctors recommended his father to take him to Italy for the winter, and this necessarily cut short his Cambridge career, so that he had to leave the university without taking his degree.(He could not have received it anyway, before [[Catholic Emancipation]].) On his return to England in 1829, he became acquainted with the [[Ignatius Spencer|Hon. George Spencer]], then an Anglican clergyman, and his conversation was largely instrumental in leading to Spencer's conversion, as the latter admits in his ''Account of my Conversion'' \u2013 \"I passed many hours daily in conversation with Phillipps and was satisfied beyond all expectations with the answers he gave me to the different questions I proposed about the principal tenets and practices of Catholics.\" The following winter (1830\u20131831) he again spent in Italy, on which occasion he met [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]], who made a great impression on him.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nOn 25 July 1833, Ambrose Phillipps married Laura Mary, eldest daughter of the Hon.

But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.\"<ref name=Suttner/>\n\nOne of the dangers of dominant parties is \"the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.\"<ref name=Suttner/> However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.<ref name=Suttner/> In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as \"[[electoralism]]\" or \"soft authoritarianism\", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.\n\nIn some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-[[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]]. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.\n\nSub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].\n\n==Current dominant-party systems==\n{{Update|section|date=July 2010|inaccurate=yes}}\n\n===Africa===\n\n*{{flag|Angola}}\n** [[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], ''Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola'' (MPLA)<ref>{{cite book |title=Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2008 |last1=Mehler |first1=Andreas |last2=Melber |first2=Henning |last3=Van Walraven |first3=Klaas |year=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17811-3 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOVYchAfCYYC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150404/http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n** In power since independence, 11 November 1975; sole legal party, 1975\u201391\n** Formerly led by President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] (in office from 10 September 1979 to 28 August 2017) and now led by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]].\n** [[1992 Angolan general election|Presidential election, 1992]]: dos Santos (MPLA-PT) won 49.6% of the vote.

But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.\"<ref name=Suttner/>\n\nOne of the dangers of dominant parties is \"the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.\"<ref name=Suttner/> However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.<ref name=Suttner/> In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as \"[[electoralism]]\" or \"soft authoritarianism\", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.\n\nIn some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-[[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]]. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.\n\nSub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].\n\n==Current dominant-party systems==\n{{Update|section|date=July 2010|inaccurate=yes}}\n\n===Africa===\n\n*{{flag|Angola}}\n** [[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], ''Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola'' (MPLA)<ref>{{cite book |title=Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2008 |last1=Mehler |first1=Andreas |last2=Melber |first2=Henning |last3=Van Walraven |first3=Klaas |year=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17811-3 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOVYchAfCYYC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150404/http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n** In power since independence, 11 November 1975; sole legal party, 1975\u201391\n** Formerly led by President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] (in office from 10 September 1979 to 28 August 2017) and now led by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]].\n** [[1992 Angolan general election|Presidential election, 1992]]: dos Santos (MPLA-PT) won 49.6% of the vote.
