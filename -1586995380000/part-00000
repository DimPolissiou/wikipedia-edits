On 11 April 2006, they were granted a further 30 days to keep their fire going, despite a Supreme Court order that they remove their tents by 2pm on 13 April 2006. The aboriginal protesters have since removed their tents, but are now sleeping in a dilapidated caravan parked in an all day car park. The [[Melbourne City Council]] has since started fining them $50 per day for overstaying the time limit. Protection (under a Court order) for the fire expired on 10 May 2006 and shortly after midnight on that date, council workers extinguished it.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Victorian Heritage List'' Statement of Significance\n* ''Kings Domain'' Melbourne City Council webpage [https://web.archive.org/web/20080726214214/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=25&pa=1273&pg=1291]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kings Domain}}\n*[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/aboriginal-protest-order-makes-unhappy-campers/2006/04/11/1144521340650.html The Age story on the protest]\n* [[n:2006 \"Stolenwealth\" Games to confront Commonwealth Games in Melbourne|Wikinews coverage of the protest]]\n\n{{Parks in Melbourne}}\n{{Melbourne landmarks}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Parks in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Melbourne]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox park\n| name = Kings Domain\n| photo = GovernmentHouseMelbourne1 gobeirne.jpg\n| photo_width = 250px\n| photo_caption = [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]] in the south-east corner of Kings Domain\n| coords = {{coord|display=it|-37.8282598|144.9775815|type:landmark_region:AU}}\n| type = Public Park\n| location = [[Melbourne, Australia]]\n| area = 36 hectares\n| opened = 1854 \n| operator = \n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| visitation_ref = \n| status = Open\n| paths = Sealed\n| transport = Tram, Bus, Car\n| terrain = Undulating hills, Riverbank\n| water = [[Yarra River]]\n| vegetation = [[Flora of Australia|Australian Native]], Lawns, Non-native traditional gardens\n| free_label = Landmarks\n| free_data = [[Yarra River]], [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]], [[Shrine of Remembrance]], [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]], [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] Remains Memorial, Various statues\n| facilities = [[Toilet]]s, Shelters, Seating\n| website = \n}}\n\n'''Kings Domain''' is an area of parklands in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

On 11 April 2006, they were granted a further 30 days to keep their fire going, despite a Supreme Court order that they remove their tents by 2pm on 13 April 2006. The aboriginal protesters have since removed their tents, but are now sleeping in a dilapidated caravan parked in an all day car park. The [[Melbourne City Council]] has since started fining them $50 per day for overstaying the time limit. Protection (under a Court order) for the fire expired on 10 May 2006 and shortly after midnight on that date, council workers extinguished it.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Victorian Heritage List'' Statement of Significance\n* ''Kings Domain'' Melbourne City Council webpage [https://web.archive.org/web/20080726214214/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=25&pa=1273&pg=1291]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kings Domain}}\n*[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/aboriginal-protest-order-makes-unhappy-campers/2006/04/11/1144521340650.html The Age story on the protest]\n* [[n:2006 \"Stolenwealth\" Games to confront Commonwealth Games in Melbourne|Wikinews coverage of the protest]]\n\n{{Parks in Melbourne}}\n{{Melbourne landmarks}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Parks in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Melbourne]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Domain"}

The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called ''named'', a contracted form of ''name [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]''. In addition, the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000. BIND 9 is actively maintained, with new releases issued several times a year.\n\nStarting in 2009, the [[Internet Software Consortium]] (ISC) developed a software suite, initially called BIND10. With release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed ''Bundy''<ref>[http://bundy-dns.de Bundy, authoritative DNS and DHCP server]</ref> to terminate ISC involvement in the project.\n\n==Key features==\nBIND 9 is intended to be fully compliant with the [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dnsop/documents/ IETF DNS standards and draft standards].  Important features of BIND 9 include: [[TSIG]], [[nsupdate]], [[IPv6]], RNDC (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, Response Rate Limiting (RRL), [[Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions|DNSSEC]], and broad portability.
