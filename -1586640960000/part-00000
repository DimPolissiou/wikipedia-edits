It's only 119 m high, but offers good views of the area.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage|Tortuguero}}\n* [http://www.cccturtle.org Caribbean Conservation Corporation] who operate the John H.

During the recording sessions of the three bands, the Druga Maca studio was visited by the young PGP RTB television directors, [[Boris Miljkovi\u0107]] and Branimir Dimitrijevi\u0107 \"Tucko\", who were at the time working together on the ''Rokenroler'' (''Rockenroller'') television show, and in the following couple of weeks, they recorded several music videos for the songs of the three bands,

''D\u017euboks'' magazine critic Mom\u010dilo Rajin, in his review of the album, comparing the release with notability of the [[Grupa 220]], [[Bijelo Dugme]], [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]] and

''[[De\u010dko koji obe\u0107ava]]'' (''Promising Boy''), for which the band recorded three songs, with [[Goran Vejvoda]] on guitar and the actor [[Aleksandar Ber\u010dek]] on lead vocals, which appeared on the movie soundtrack.<ref name=\"Janjatovic1\"/> The recorded songs, for which the music was written by Koji\u0107 and the lyrics by the screenplay writer [[Neboj\u0161a Pajki\u0107]], were performed in the movie by the fictional musical group VIS Dobri De\u010daci (''The Good Boys''), with Koji\u0107 acting the guitar player role, Vdovi\u0107 the drummer role and Ber\u010dek the

The songs \"Slobodan\" (a popular Serbian [[Slobodan|name]], literally means \"free\"), \"Balada o tvrdim grudima\" (\"The Ballad of Hard Breasts\") and \"Depresija\" (\"Depression), however, were never officially released.<ref name=\"Janjatovic1\"/> In March of the same year, \u0160arlo Akrobata participated the ''Pozdrav iz Beograda'' (''Greetings from Belgrade'') concert organized in Zagreb as a promotion of the Belgrade new wave scene, and a live promotion of ''Paket aran\u017eman'', on which the band also promoted their debut single \"Mali \u010dovek\", with \"Ona se budi\" as the single B-side, released prior to the event.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pamtili pa vratili|last=Gaji\u0107|first=Goran|date=March 13, 1981|publisher=D\u017euboks magazine No. 110|language=Serbo-Croatian}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad...'' ===\nIn April 1981, the band entered the studio in order to record their debut studio album, which was intended to be released through [[PGP RTB]].

2\">{{harvnb|Janjatovic|2006|p=221}}</ref> The recording sessions were based on a kind of a system where Mladenovi\u0107 and Koji\u0107 would bring fresh raw ideas and Vdovi\u0107 would modify and shape them.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Mladenovi\u0107 was into poetic and melodic aspect of the whole thing while Koji\u0107, inspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]] style of playing, was turned to minimal lyrics and aggressive music which can be recognized on different tracks on the album and their work in general.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/>\n\nEventually, in July 1981, after purchasing the recordings from PGP RTB, the debut album ''[[Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad...]]'' (''Brighter or Dumber a Man Gets When...''), was released by [[Jugoton]].<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> The material featured guest appearances by Goran Vejvoda, Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107, Jurij Novoseli\u0107 \"Kuzma\" from the band [[Film (band)|Film]] and Dejan Kosti\u0107 from [[Grupa I]].<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> The producer of the album was signed as Akpi\u0111oto (misspelled on the album cover as Akti\u0111oto) which represents a combination of names of the real producers: Akrobata (the band), Pile (the nickname of Mile Mileti\u0107), \u0110or\u0111e (\u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107) and Toni (Toni Jurij, a recording engineer from [[Ljubljana]] who was an expert on dub techniques).<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> The album front cover was designed by the band themselves with Goran Vejvoda (who also designed the ''Paket aran\u017eman'' cover), the front cover featuring the band with their backs turned and facing a boy to create a kind of a notion of a mirror,<ref name=\"Vesic\">Vesi\u0107 (director), 2008</ref> with the band members also contributing with their own drawings on the inner sleeve: Mladenovi\u0107's drawing of his girlfriend, Koji\u0107 drew a two scene caricature and added the text from ''[[Politikin Zabavnik]]'' from an article about the \"acrobatic ladles\"

lyrics for the highly experimental track \"Pazite na decu I\" (\"Take Care Of The Children I\") were also taken.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Beside the experimental \"Pazite na decu I\" and \"Ljubavna pesma\", the album featured the rearranged songs from the Limunovo Drvo period, along with the new material, and the entire written material and arrangements were credited to \u0160arlo Akrobata, rather than the individual band members themselves.<ref name=\"popboks1\"/> However, the fact that the album did not feature the hit songs from ''Paket aran\u017eman'' like \"Ona se budi\" or \"Niko kao ja\", which the band considered as repetition of old material, affected the album and sales, with the album being sold in about 10.000 copies without another repressing by Jugoton.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> Like with the case of ''Paket aran\u017eman'', despite not being commercially successful, the album proved to be one of the most significant albums released in the history of

act for the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] at the [[Music Biennale Zagreb]] festival.<ref name=popboks>{{cite web|url=http://www.popboks.com/tekst.php?ID=6434 |title=Prona\u0111oh tu retku

canceled.<ref name=popboks/> At that time, the professional and, consequently, private relations within the group had not been very well among its members, mostly because of the different views on the future directions of the band.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Vdovi\u0107 insisted on bringing in the band Goran Vejvoda and possibly even Vejvoda's girlfriend at the time [[Bebi Dol|Dragana \u0160ari\u0107]], both of which the members of his side project Announda Rouge.<ref name=popboks/> Mladenovi\u0107 was mostly receptive to the idea, also wanted to add a keyboard player and Vejvoda was one of the rare young musicians in Belgrade at the time who owned a Casio VL-2 synthesizer, whereas Koji\u0107 vehemently objected to it, feeling the current lineup still had much more to offer.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Koji\u0107 would later state, in the 2006 documentary about Ekatarina Velika, ''Kao da je bilo nekad'', that the normal relations and communication in \u0160arlo Akrobata lasted only about six months.<ref name=\"Vesic\"/>\n\nAccording to Koji\u0107, the band was also reluctant to promote the album with much touring as the writing had already been on the wall since the trio barely tolerated each other at this point, knowing for some time they would soon split apart.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> The band were also to release a new [[Double A-side|double A-side single]] \"Bes\" (\"Anger\") / \"Prevaren\" (\"Fooled\"), the former being an original version of the dub remix featured on the debut album and the latter being a power pop track version of a Limunovo Drvo track, which were recorded during the album recording sessions, but it was never released.<ref name=\"popboks1\"/> In the Autumn of 1981, they got the \"Smeli cvet\" award for music by Socialistic Youth Of Yugoslavia, after which the band embarked on a previously booked tour of [[Poland]], during which they also had an unplanned jam improvising session with some of the British jazz performers at the [[Warsaw]] jazz festival.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> Upon returning to Yugoslavia, the band performed at a farewell show [[Ljubljana]] in October 1981, which, along with the Music Biennale Zagreb festival performance, proved to be the highest attending \u0160arlo Akrobata concert (circa 1.000 people),<ref name=\"eunet1\"/> after which they disbanded.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/>\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\nBy the time \u0160arlo Akrobata disbanded, Koji\u0107 had already had several rehearsals with the band's manager Nenad Krasovac \"Kele\", who was also the drummer of the Belgrade punk rock band [[Urbana Gerila]], as a duo under the name of Disciplina Ki\u010dme, featuring himself on bass guitar and Krasovac on drums.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> Following the disbandment, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 with Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107 on guitar, Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 on drums, and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar, formed the band Katarina II, soon to be joined

After performing as an opening act for [[Pankrti]] in April 1980, Mihajlovi\u0107 left the band and the remaining three members changed their name to \u0160arlo Akrobata, after a Yugoslav nickname for actor [[Charlie Chaplin]]. Subsequently, the trio recorded four tracks which were released on the 1981 compilation album ''[[Paket aran\u017eman]]'', now considered to be one of the most influential releases in the history of former [[Yugoslav rock]] music. During 1981, the band released their debut album ''[[Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad...]]'', after which, owing to irreconcilable differences between the band members, the band ceased to exist. The album received critical recognition and is regarded as one of the most notable albums of former Yugoslav rock music.\n\nAfter the band disbandment, Mladenovi\u0107 with Vdovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 formed [[Katarina II]], which changed its name to [[Ekatarina Velika]] after the departure of the latter two, and Koji\u0107 formed [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]], changing its name to [[Disciplin A Kitschme]] in 1995.

[[Sini\u0161a \u0160karica]] came up with an idea of releasing the recordings of three bands in a compilation album, rather than releasing separate [[maxi single]]s.<ref name=\"Sretno dijete 1\"/> During the recording sessions of the three bands, the Druga Maca studio was visited by the young PGP RTB television directors, [[Boris Miljkovi\u0107]] and Branimir Dimitrijevi\u0107 \"Tucko\", who were at the time working together on the ''Rokenroler'' (''Rockenroller'') television show, and in the following couple of weeks, they recorded several music videos for the songs of the three bands,

''[[De\u010dko koji obe\u0107ava]]'' (''Promising Boy''), for which the band recorded three songs, with [[Goran Vejvoda]] on guitar and the actor [[Aleksandar Ber\u010dek]] on lead vocals, which appeared on the movie soundtrack.<ref name=\"Janjatovic1\"/> The recorded songs, for which the music was written by Koji\u0107 and the lyrics by the screenplay writer [[Neboj\u0161a Pajki\u0107]], were performed in the movie by the fictional musical group VIS Dobri De\u010daci (''The Good Boys''), with Koji\u0107 acting the guitar player role, Vdovi\u0107 the drummer role and Ber\u010dek the

shape them.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Mladenovi\u0107 was into poetic and melodic aspect of the whole thing while Koji\u0107, inspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]] style of playing, was turned to minimal lyrics and aggressive music which can be recognized on different tracks on the album and their work in general.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/>\n\nEventually, in July 1981, after purchasing the recordings from PGP RTB, the debut album ''[[Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad...]]'' (''Brighter or Dumber a Man Gets When...''), was released by [[Jugoton]].<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> The material featured guest appearances by Goran Vejvoda, Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107, Jurij Novoseli\u0107 \"Kuzma\" from the band [[Film (band)|Film]] and Dejan Kosti\u0107 from [[Grupa I]].<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> The producer of the album was signed as Akpi\u0111oto (misspelled on the album cover as Akti\u0111oto) which represents a combination of names of the real producers: Akrobata (the band), Pile (the nickname of Mile Mileti\u0107), \u0110or\u0111e (\u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107) and Toni (Toni Jurij, a recording engineer from [[Ljubljana]] who was an expert on dub techniques).<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> The album front cover was designed by the band themselves with Goran Vejvoda (who also designed the ''Paket aran\u017eman'' cover), the front cover featuring the band with their backs turned and facing a boy to create a kind of a notion of a mirror,<ref name=\"Vesic\">Vesi\u0107 (director), 2008</ref> with the band members also contributing with their own drawings on the inner sleeve: Mladenovi\u0107's drawing of his girlfriend, Koji\u0107 drew a two scene caricature and added the text from ''[[Politikin Zabavnik]]'' from an article about the \"acrobatic ladles\"

lyrics for the highly experimental track \"Pazite na decu I\" (\"Take Care Of The Children I\") were also taken.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Beside the experimental \"Pazite na decu I\" and \"Ljubavna pesma\", the album featured the rearranged songs from the Limunovo Drvo period, along with the new material, and the entire written material and arrangements were credited to \u0160arlo Akrobata, rather than the individual band members themselves.<ref name=\"popboks1\"/> However, the fact that the album did not feature the hit songs from ''Paket aran\u017eman'' like \"Ona se budi\" or \"Niko kao ja\", which the band considered as repetition of old material, affected the album and sales, with the album being sold in about 10.000 copies without another repressing by Jugoton.<ref

canceled.<ref name=popboks/> At that time, the professional and, consequently, private relations within the group had not been very well among its members, mostly because of the different views on the future directions of the band.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Vdovi\u0107 insisted on bringing in the band Goran Vejvoda and possibly even Vejvoda's girlfriend at the time [[Bebi Dol|Dragana \u0160ari\u0107]], both of which the members of his side project Announda Rouge.<ref name=popboks/> Mladenovi\u0107 was mostly receptive to the idea, also wanted to add a keyboard player and Vejvoda was one of the rare young musicians in Belgrade at the time who owned a Casio VL-2 synthesizer, whereas Koji\u0107 vehemently objected to it, feeling the current lineup still had much more to offer.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/> Koji\u0107 would later state, in the 2006 documentary about Ekatarina Velika, ''Kao da je bilo nekad'', that the normal relations and communication in \u0160arlo Akrobata lasted only about six months.<ref name=\"Vesic\"/>\n\nAccording to Koji\u0107, the band was also reluctant to promote the album with much touring as the writing had already been on the wall since the trio barely tolerated each other at this point, knowing for some time they would soon split apart.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> The band were also to release a new [[Double A-side|double A-side single]] \"Bes\" (\"Anger\") / \"Prevaren\" (\"Fooled\"), the former being an original version of the dub remix featured on the debut album and the latter being a power pop track version of a Limunovo Drvo track, which were recorded during the album recording sessions, but it was never released.<ref name=\"popboks1\"/> In the Autumn of 1981, they got the \"Smeli cvet\" award for music by Socialistic Youth Of Yugoslavia, after which the band embarked on a previously booked tour of [[Poland]], during which they also had an unplanned jam improvising session with some of the British jazz performers at the [[Warsaw]] jazz festival.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> Upon returning to Yugoslavia, the band performed at a farewell show [[Ljubljana]] in October 1981, which, along with the Music Biennale Zagreb festival performance, proved to be the highest attending \u0160arlo Akrobata concert (circa 1.000 people),<ref name=\"eunet1\"/> after which they disbanded.<ref name=\"Janjatovic 2\"/>\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\nBy the time \u0160arlo Akrobata disbanded, Koji\u0107 had already had several rehearsals with the band's manager Nenad Krasovac \"Kele\", who was also the drummer of the Belgrade punk rock band [[Urbana Gerila]], as a duo under the name of Disciplina Ki\u010dme, featuring himself on bass guitar and Krasovac on drums.<ref name=\"popboks2\"/> Following the disbandment, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 with Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107 on guitar, Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 on drums, and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar, formed the band Katarina II, soon to be joined
