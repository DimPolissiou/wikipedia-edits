C. (Michael Charles)|isbn=1-85573-839-2|location=Boca Raton|oclc=56123328}}</ref> The objective of the feed system is to spread products into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system \u2014 usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products, like whole potatoes \u2014 pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while the good product continues along its normal trajectory.\n\nThe ideal sorter to use depends on the application. Therefore, the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determine the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.\n\n== Sensors ==\nOptical sorters require a combination of lights and sensors to illuminate and capture images of the objects so the images can be processed. The processed images will determine if the material should be accepted or rejected.\n\nThere are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of the two on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[Spectrum|spectrums]]. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]]\n=== Cameras ===\nMonochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.\n\nSophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.\n\nCoupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape; as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object.\n\n=== Lasers ===\nWhile cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to distinguish a material's structural properties along with their color. This structural property inspection allows lasers to detect a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic; even if they are the same color as the good product.\n\nLasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light; whether on the visible spectrum or beyond.<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Scattered/transmitted light information system|gdate=1992-09-30|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1993007468A1/en}}</ref> For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths; which is a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|last2=Lu|first2=Hongfei|last3=Zheng|first3=Yueping|last4=Lou|first4=Heqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Cuiqin|date=2010-12-01|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. \u2018hongxing\u2019) using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=101|issue=4|pages=402\u2013408|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|issn=0260-8774}}</ref>\n\n=== Camera/Laser Combinations ===\nSorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal.[[File:Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips shows invisible defects]]\n=== Hyperspectral Imaging ===\nDriven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html|title=StackPath|website=www.vision-systems.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nLike trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].\n\n== Software Driven Intelligence ==\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing is used to manipulate the raw data. The image processing extracts and categorizes information about specific features. The user then defines accept/reject thresholds that are used to determine what is good and bad in the raw data flow. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products. When used to control the sorter's ejection system, it can improve the accuracy of ejecting defective products. This improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n== Platforms ==\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product \u2013 large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize \u2013 and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\n=== Channel Sorters ===\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard, and dry with a consistent size and shape; such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that cannot be handled by a channel sorter \u2013 such as soft, wet, or nonhomogeneous products \u2013 and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed, sorters or belt sorters are more ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties, and chemical composition.\n\n=== Freefall and Chute-fed Sorters ===\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall and chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point and lower maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n=== Belt Sorters ===\n[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]]\nBelt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying. The products are often stabilized on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect products from above the belt, while other sorters also send products off of the belt for an in-air inspection. These sorters can either be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or three-way sorting if two ejector systems with three outfeed streams are equipped.\n=== ADR Systems ===\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. The combination of an ADR system followed by a mechanical nubbin grader is another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\n=== Single-file Inspection Systems ===\nThe platforms described above all operate with materials in bulk; meaning they do not need the materials to be in a single-file to be inspected. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. These sorters are effective in removing foreign objects based on differences in size, shape and color. They are not as popular as the other platforms due to decreased efficiency. \n\n=== Mechanical Graders ===\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems are used because sensors and image processing software is not necessary.These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n== Practical Usage ==\n\n=== Waste and Recycling ===\nOptical sorting machines can be used to identify and discard manufacturing waste, such as metals, drywall, cardboard, and various plastics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/typical-wastes-generated-industry-sectors|title=Typical Wastes Generated by Industry Sectors|last=US EPA|first=OLEM|date=2015-05-26|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> In the metal industry, optical sorting machines are used to discard plastics, glass, wood, and other non-needed metals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mssoptical.com/service/optical-sorting-innovation/|title=Optical Sorting Applications And Sorting Machines {{!}} MSS|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The plastic industry uses optical sorting machines to not only discard various materials like those listed, but also different types of plastics.

C. (Michael Charles)|isbn=1-85573-839-2|location=Boca Raton|oclc=56123328}}</ref> The objective of the feed system is to spread products into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system \u2014 usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products, like whole potatoes \u2014 pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while the good product continues along its normal trajectory.\n\nThe ideal sorter to use depends on the application. Therefore, the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determine the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.\n\n== Sensors ==\nOptical sorters require a combination of lights and sensors to illuminate and capture images of the objects so the images can be processed. The processed images will determine if the material should be accepted or rejected.\n\nThere are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of the two on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[Spectrum|spectrums]]. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]]\n=== Cameras ===\nMonochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.\n\nSophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.\n\nCoupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape; as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object.\n\n=== Lasers ===\nWhile cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to distinguish a material's structural properties along with their color. This structural property inspection allows lasers to detect a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic; even if they are the same color as the good product.\n\nLasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light; whether on the visible spectrum or beyond.<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Scattered/transmitted light information system|gdate=1992-09-30|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1993007468A1/en}}</ref> For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths; which is a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|last2=Lu|first2=Hongfei|last3=Zheng|first3=Yueping|last4=Lou|first4=Heqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Cuiqin|date=2010-12-01|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. \u2018hongxing\u2019) using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=101|issue=4|pages=402\u2013408|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|issn=0260-8774}}</ref>\n\n=== Camera/Laser Combinations ===\nSorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal.[[File:Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips shows invisible defects]]\n=== Hyperspectral Imaging ===\nDriven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html|title=StackPath|website=www.vision-systems.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nLike trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].\n\n== Software Driven Intelligence ==\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing is used to manipulate the raw data. The image processing extracts and categorizes information about specific features. The user then defines accept/reject thresholds that are used to determine what is good and bad in the raw data flow. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products. When used to control the sorter's ejection system, it can improve the accuracy of ejecting defective products. This improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n== Platforms ==\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product \u2013 large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize \u2013 and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\n=== Channel sorters ===\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard, and dry with a consistent size and shape; such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that cannot be handled by a channel sorter \u2013 such as soft, wet, or nonhomogeneous products \u2013 and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed, sorters or belt sorters are more ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties, and chemical composition.\n\n=== Freefall and Chute-fed Sorters ===\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall and chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point and lower maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n=== Belt Sorters ===\n[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]]\nBelt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying. The products are often stabilized on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect products from above the belt, while other sorters also send products off of the belt for an in-air inspection. These sorters can either be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or three-way sorting if two ejector systems with three outfeed streams are equipped.\n=== ADR Systems ===\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. The combination of an ADR system followed by a mechanical nubbin grader is another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\n=== Single-file Inspection Systems ===\nThe platforms described above all operate with materials in bulk; meaning they do not need the materials to be in a single-file to be inspected. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. These sorters are effective in removing foreign objects based on differences in size, shape and color. They are not as popular as the other platforms due to decreased efficiency. \n\n=== Mechanical Graders ===\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems are used because sensors and image processing software is not necessary.These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n== Practical Usage ==\n\n=== Waste and Recycling ===\nOptical sorting machines can be used to identify and discard manufacturing waste, such as metals, drywall, cardboard, and various plastics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/typical-wastes-generated-industry-sectors|title=Typical Wastes Generated by Industry Sectors|last=US EPA|first=OLEM|date=2015-05-26|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> In the metal industry, optical sorting machines are used to discard plastics, glass, wood, and other non-needed metals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mssoptical.com/service/optical-sorting-innovation/|title=Optical Sorting Applications And Sorting Machines {{!}} MSS|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The plastic industry uses optical sorting machines to not only discard various materials like those listed, but also different types of plastics.

It serves light rail, intercity rail, intercity bus, and local bus services.\n\nIt is the eastern terminus for the [[METRO Green Line]] light rail line, with the stop located outside the station's [[headhouse]]. It is also the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]]' stop for [[Amtrak]], the national intercity railroad service. In addition to rail, Union Depot also serves [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]], [[Minnesota Valley Transit Authority|MVTA]], [[Jefferson Lines]], [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], and [[Megabus (North America)|MegaBus]].\n\nThe headhouse, located at the 4th Street entrance, was designed by architect [[Charles Sumner Frost]] and is [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] in style. The [[concourse]] and the waiting room that extend over the tracks are viewed as a great architectural achievements. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974. It is also a [[contributing property]] to the [[Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Lowertown Historic District]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lowertown Historic District|url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/DistrictProperties.cfm?NPSNum=83000935|work=Minnesota National Register Properties Database|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|year=2009|accessdate=January 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its transit uses, Union Depot also contains a [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]] rental car location, coffee shop, restaurant, a bike shop, offices, a museum, and loft condominiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://streets.mn/2018/03/14/living-in-union-depot/|title=Living in Union Depot|last=Browender|first=Wolfie|date=2018-03-14|website=streets.mn|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Original Union Depot===\n{{Multiple image\n|align = left\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|image1 = Pf026545-1-.jpg\n|image2 = Saint Paul Union Depot.jpg\n|footer = The original depot before 1886 ''(top)'' and in 1890 ''(bottom)''\n}}\n\nThere have been two Union Depots in Saint Paul. The first was completed in 1881, and combined the services of several different railroads into one building (hence the \"union\"; see [[Union station]]). In 1888 the old station had its peak year, handling eight million passengers. That year, about 150 trains departed daily.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Around this time, the building was remodeled with a taller central tower and other alterations to the [[roof]]line.  This station burned in 1915.\n\n===Current building===\nThe current structure was started in 1917 but was not completed until 1923 because [[World War I]] caused construction to halt for several years.\n\nDuring its heyday, the depot hosted the passenger trains of nine railroads, and more than 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through.  However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a stub terminal. These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniondepot.org/docs/2003%20LTK%20Depot%20Study/LTKFinalreport.pdf|title=Saint Paul Union Depot Analysis Final Report|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Saint Paul Union Depot Company controlled {{convert|9.24|mi|km}} of St. Paul trackage and terminal facilities, including the depot building. The company was operated in tandem with the Minnesota Transfer Railway Company, with effective control of both properties exercised by the same board, composed of representatives of the nine tenants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00770.xml|title=Saint Paul Union Depot Company|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTrain ridership began to erode in the 1920s as the automobile took hold and airlines began to operate.  The railroads sought ways stem the flow of passengers and compete with these new forms of transportation.  As the [[Great Depression]] unfolded, more aggressive moves were required.  The [[streamliner]] era in the United States began in 1934 with the introduction of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]]'s ''[[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]]''.  After making a \"Dawn-to-Dusk Dash\" from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[Denver, Colorado]], the CB&Q's interest soon turned to the Twin Cities run. A demonstration run was completed in 6 hours and 4 minutes, including six one-minute stops.<ref name=\"hiawatha\">{{Scribbins-Hiawatha-2007}}</ref> Other railroads were soon busy investigating how to run faster trains to Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n[[Image:Locomotive William Crooks at St. Paul Union Depot 1954.jpg|thumb|left|William Crooks locomotive being set up as a static display in the station's waiting room in 1954.

The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]'s ''[[Twin Cities Hiawatha|Hiawatha]]'' and the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]]'s ''[[Twin Cities Zephyr]]'' were introduced with 6\u00bd hour service a few months later at the same time, and C&NW  matched their schedules.<ref name=\"hiawatha\"/><ref name=\"400-story\">{{Scribbins-400-2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Burlington ''Zephyrs'' were the first [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[diesel-electric locomotive|diesel-electric]] trains to serve the Twin Cities, and originally ran in an [[articulated car|articulated]] configuration.  The ''400'' (now renamed the ''Twin Cities 400'') followed in 1939, but using more conventional trucks and couplers to link passenger cars together.  The ''Hiawatha'' had always been powered by a streamlined (or, in the terminology of the Milwaukee Road, \"speedlined\") [[steam locomotive]].  The ''Twin Cities Zephyrs'' added a second set of trains daily in 1936, running the ''Morning Zephyr'' and ''Afternoon Zephyr'' from each terminal.  The ''Hiawatha'' added a second set of trains in 1939, and the ''Morning Hiawatha'' and ''Afternoon Hiawatha'' each provided daily service from Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago.\n\nThe ''Morning Hiawatha'' may have held the record as the world's [[land speed record for rail vehicles|fastest steam train]] on two or more measures: The {{convert|78.3|miles|km}} run from [[Sparta, Wisconsin|Sparta]] to [[Portage, Wisconsin]] was scheduled for 58 minutes&mdash;an average of {{convert|81|mph|km/h}}.  Speeds up to and above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} were achieved on a daily basis, and the powerful [[Milwaukee Road class F7]] engines (designed for a \"reserve speed\" of {{convert|125|mph|km/h}}) likely ran more miles at or above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} than any other steam locomotives in history.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Benn|url=http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|title=Fastest Steam Locomotive?|access-date=February 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420181235/http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|archive-date=April 20, 2006|df=}}</ref>\n\nBurlington's diesel ''Zephyrs'' were also very fast, and they had to be\u2014the ''Zephyr'' route was about {{convert|20|mi|km}} longer than the competition.

Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable.\n\n===End of service===\nThe ''Twin Cities 400'' was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963.\n\nIt was announced that when [[Amtrak]] formally took over most passenger service on May 1, 1971, it would consolidate its Twin Cities service in Minneapolis at the [[Minneapolis Great Northern Depot]]. Accordingly, the Burlington (later [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) ''Zephyrs'' ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed.  The ''Afternoon Zephyr'' was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the ''Empire Builder'' and ''North Coast Limited'' from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the ''Zephyr'' had the \"honor\" of being the last train to depart the station.<ref>Steve Glischinski, eyewitness account at depot on April 30, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Restoration and return of passenger service===\n[[File:Concourse of the Saint Paul Union Depot during renovation, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the station during renovation]]\nArea boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] [[light rail]] project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses.\n\nA few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging [[semi-trailer truck]]s carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. In the early 2000s, the upper levels of the headhouse were  converted into 33 2-story loft condominiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpaulcondos.com/project/union-depot-lofts/|title=Union Depot Lofts|website=StPaulCondos.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Opening Day 3.jpg|thumb|left|Grand opening of the newly renovated waiting room]]\nIn 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]] transit hub served by Amtrak trains, [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] light rail, and intercity bus lines.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/12/08/regional/union-depot-reopening/|title=Party marks reopening of St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Shenoy|first=Rupa|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/thousands-visit-st-pauls-newly-renovated-union-depot/|title=Thousands Visit St. Paul\u2019s Newly Renovated Union Depot|last=Melo|first=Frederick|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|title=Renovation|website=www.stpauluniondepot.com|access-date=May 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221408/http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|archive-date=May 12, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]] [[light rail]] station and for future passenger rail use.<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Paul Union Depot purchase approved|url=http://www.railwayage.com//content/view/907/121/|work=[[Railway Age]]|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, USPS moved most of the truck operations to a [[bulk mail]] processing center in [[Eagan, Minnesota]], making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub. Demolition of the Postal Service building that blocked track access to the station began in mid-March 2011. The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end.\n\nThe renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article/USDOT-approves-TIGER-grant-agreement-for-Minnesotas-Union-Depot--25091|title=USDOT approves TIGER grant agreement for Minnesota's Union Depot|website=www.progressiverailroading.com|publisher=Progressive Railroading|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\"/><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\"/><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\"/>\n\nThe first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound ''Empire Builder'' which stopped at the station at 11:30pm on May 7, 2014, 70 minutes late heading en route to [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

In 1971, Amtrak consolidated all passenger rail service for the Twin Cities at the [[Minneapolis Great Northern Depot|Great Northern Station]] in [[Minneapolis]], and in 1978 moved to the [[Midway (Amtrak station)|Midway Station]] in Saint Paul, about halfway between the downtowns of the two cities.<ref name = Melo>{{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_25716518/amtraks-arrival-at-union-depot-celebrated|title=After 43 years, St. Paul's Union Depot marks return of passenger trains|last=Melo|first=Fredrick|website=twincitiespress.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date= May 7, 2014|access-date=May 10, 2014}}</ref> Service returned to the Union Depot from Midway in 2014 after it was delayed for almost two years from the depot's initial grand re-opening in 2012 due to negotiations with the owners of the railroads ([[Canadian Pacific Railway]], [[BNSF Railway]], and [[Union Pacific Railroad]]) in the area<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/04/02/news/amtrak-union-depot|title=Amtrak sets May 7 return to St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Gilbert|first=Curtis|website=www.mprnews|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=April 2, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> and the construction of new complex signals on the [[Merriam Park Subdivision]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.twincities.com/cityhallscoop/2013/01/14/amtraks-arrival-delayed-union-depot-welcomes-jefferson-bus-lines-whose-chair-now-runs-mndot/|title=Amtrak\u2019s arrival delayed.

The southern terminus of this route is planned to be at St. Paul Union Depot. The [[Gateway Corridor]] (now called the Gold Line) is also planned to be bus rapid transit and will operate between St. Paul and [[Woodbury, Minnesota|Woodbury]]. The [[Red Rock Corridor]] has also been proposed as a BRT service and eventually being upgraded to commuter rail, however plans are on hold as ridership on the current bus routes in this corridor are low.\n\nThe [[Riverview Corridor]] is planned to be a LRT/modern streetcar hybrid operating between St. Paul Union Depot and Mall of America. Riverview Corridor trains would share tracks and stations with the Metro Green Line between Central Station and Union Depot Station.\n\n===Regional rail===\nNumerous existing freight rail lines branch out from St. Paul Union Depot and could be upgraded and utilized by regional passenger trains. Currently MnDOT has studied regional rail from St. Paul Union Depot to [[Mankato]], [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], and Minneapolis (continuing further west as a through-service). In 2010, the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/railplan/files/DraftSRPFinalReport.pdf|title=Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan (Draft Final Report)|date=December 2009|author=Cambridge Systematics, Inc., Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc., and TKDA, Inc.|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===High-speed rail===\nNew trains running at speeds above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991.

The first was completed in 1881, and combined the services of several different railroads into one building (hence the \"union\"; see [[Union station]]). In 1888 the old station had its peak year, handling eight million passengers. That year, about 150 trains departed daily.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Around this time, the building was remodeled with a taller central tower and other alterations to the [[roof]]line.  This station burned in 1915.\n\n===Current building===\nThe current structure was started in 1917 but was not completed until 1923 because [[World War I]] caused construction to halt for several years.\n\nDuring its heyday, the depot hosted the passenger trains of nine railroads, and more than 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through.  However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a stub terminal. These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniondepot.org/docs/2003%20LTK%20Depot%20Study/LTKFinalreport.pdf|title=Saint Paul Union Depot Analysis Final Report|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Saint Paul Union Depot Company controlled {{convert|9.24|mi|km}} of St. Paul trackage and terminal facilities, including the depot building.

The railroads sought ways stem the flow of passengers and compete with these new forms of transportation.  As the [[Great Depression]] unfolded, more aggressive moves were required.  The [[streamliner]] era in the United States began in 1934 with the introduction of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]]'s ''[[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]]''.  After making a \"Dawn-to-Dusk Dash\" from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[Denver, Colorado]], the CB&Q's interest soon turned to the Twin Cities run. A demonstration run was completed in 6 hours and 4 minutes, including six one-minute stops.<ref name=\"hiawatha\">{{Scribbins-Hiawatha-2007}}</ref> Other railroads were soon busy investigating how to run faster trains to Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n[[Image:Locomotive William Crooks at St. Paul Union Depot 1954.jpg|thumb|left|William Crooks locomotive being set up as a static display in the station's waiting room in 1954.

The ''400'' (now renamed the ''Twin Cities 400'') followed in 1939, but using more conventional trucks and couplers to link passenger cars together.  The ''Hiawatha'' had always been powered by a streamlined (or, in the terminology of the Milwaukee Road, \"speedlined\") [[steam locomotive]].  The ''Twin Cities Zephyrs'' added a second set of trains daily in 1936, running the ''Morning Zephyr'' and ''Afternoon Zephyr'' from each terminal.  The ''Hiawatha'' added a second set of trains in 1939, and the ''Morning Hiawatha'' and ''Afternoon Hiawatha'' each provided daily service from Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago.\n\nThe ''Morning Hiawatha'' may have held the record as the world's [[land speed record for rail vehicles|fastest steam train]] on two or more measures: The {{convert|78.3|miles|km}} run from [[Sparta, Wisconsin|Sparta]] to [[Portage, Wisconsin]] was scheduled for 58 minutes&mdash;an average of {{convert|81|mph|km/h}}.  Speeds up to and above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} were achieved on a daily basis, and the powerful [[Milwaukee Road class F7]] engines (designed for a \"reserve speed\" of {{convert|125|mph|km/h}}) likely ran more miles at or above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} than any other steam locomotives in history.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Benn|url=http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|title=Fastest Steam Locomotive?|access-date=February 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420181235/http://www.germansteam.co.uk/FastestLoco/fastestloco.html#MR2|archive-date=April 20, 2006|df=}}</ref>\n\nBurlington's diesel ''Zephyrs'' were also very fast, and they had to be\u2014the ''Zephyr'' route was about {{convert|20|mi|km}} longer than the competition.

Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable.\n\n===End of service===\nThe ''Twin Cities 400'' was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963.\n\nIt was announced that when [[Amtrak]] formally took over most passenger service on May 1, 1971, it would consolidate its Twin Cities service in Minneapolis at the [[Minneapolis Great Northern Depot]]. Accordingly, the Burlington (later [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) ''Zephyrs'' ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed.  The ''Afternoon Zephyr'' was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the ''Empire Builder'' and ''North Coast Limited'' from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the ''Zephyr'' had the \"honor\" of being the last train to depart the station.<ref>Steve Glischinski, eyewitness account at depot on April 30, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Restoration and return of passenger service===\n[[File:Concourse of the Saint Paul Union Depot during renovation, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the station during renovation]]\nArea boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] [[light rail]] project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses.\n\nA few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging [[semi-trailer truck]]s carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. In the early 2000s, the upper levels of the headhouse were  converted into 33 2-story loft condominiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpaulcondos.com/project/union-depot-lofts/|title=Union Depot Lofts|website=StPaulCondos.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Opening Day 3.jpg|thumb|left|Grand opening of the newly renovated waiting room]]\nIn 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]] transit hub served by Amtrak trains, [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] light rail, and intercity bus lines.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/12/08/regional/union-depot-reopening/|title=Party marks reopening of St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Shenoy|first=Rupa|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\">{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/thousands-visit-st-pauls-newly-renovated-union-depot/|title=Thousands Visit St. Paul\u2019s Newly Renovated Union Depot|last=Melo|first=Frederick|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|title=Renovation|website=www.stpauluniondepot.com|access-date=May 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221408/http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|archive-date=May 12, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]] [[light rail]] station and for future passenger rail use.<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Paul Union Depot purchase approved|url=http://www.railwayage.com//content/view/907/121/|work=[[Railway Age]]|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, USPS moved most of the truck operations to a [[bulk mail]] processing center in [[Eagan, Minnesota]], making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub.

The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end.\n\nThe renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article/USDOT-approves-TIGER-grant-agreement-for-Minnesotas-Union-Depot--25091|title=USDOT approves TIGER grant agreement for Minnesota's Union Depot|website=www.progressiverailroading.com|publisher=Progressive Railroading|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012.<ref name=\"minnesota.publicradio.org\"/><ref name=\"minnesota.cbslocal.com\"/><ref name=\"stpauluniondepot.com\"/>\n\nThe first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound ''Empire Builder'' which stopped at the station at 11:30pm on May 7, 2014, 70 minutes late heading en route to [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

Currently MnDOT has studied regional rail from St. Paul Union Depot to [[Mankato]], [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], and Minneapolis (continuing further west as a through-service). In 2010, the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/railplan/files/DraftSRPFinalReport.pdf|title=Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan (Draft Final Report)|date=December 2009|author=Cambridge Systematics, Inc., Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc., and TKDA, Inc.|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===High-speed rail===\nNew trains running at speeds above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991.

It has a small body size and glossy brown fur. It is similar in appearance to several other mouse-eared bats, including the [[Indiana bat]], [[Northern long-eared bat (myotis)|northern long-eared bat]], and [[Arizona myotis]], to which it is closely related. Despite its name, the little brown bat is not closely related to the [[big brown bat]], which belongs to a different genus.\n\nIts mating system is [[polygynandry|polygynandrous]], or promiscuous, and females give birth to one offspring annually. The offspring, called pups, are quickly weaned and reach adult size in some dimensions by three weeks old. The little brown bat has a mean lifespan of 6.5 years, though one individual in the wild reached 34 years old. It is [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], foraging for its [[insect]] prey at night and roosting in hollow trees or buildings during the day, among less common roost types. It navigates and locates prey with [[animal echolocation#bats|echolocation]].\n\nIt has few natural predators, but may be killed by [[bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[owl]]s, as well as terrestrial predators such as [[raccoon]]s. Other sources of mortality include diseases such as [[rabies]] and [[white-nose syndrome]]. White-nose syndrome has been a significant cause of mortality since 2006, killing over one million little brown bats by 2011. In the [[Northeastern United States]], population loss has been extreme, with surveyed [[hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernacula]] (caves used for hibernation) averaging a population loss of 90%.\n\nHumans frequently encounter the little brown bat due to its habit of roosting in buildings. Colonies in buildings are often considered [[pest (organism)|pests]] because of the production of waste or the concern of [[rabies]] transmission. Little brown bats rarely test positive for rabies, however. Some people attempt to attract little brown bats to their property, but not their houses, by installing [[Nest box#Bat box construction|bat houses]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{cladogram|align=left|style=width:275px;font-size:85%;line-height:85%|caption=Relationships of Nearctic ''Myotis'' species<ref name=\"Stadelmann 2007\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.06.019|pmid=17049280|title=Molecular phylogeny of New World ''Myotis'' (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA genes|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=43|issue=1|pages=32\u201348|year=2007|last1=Stadelmann|first1=B|last2=Lin|first2=L.K|last3=Kunz|first3=T.H|last4=Ruedi|first4=M}}</ref>\n|cladogram={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n     |1=Old World spp.\n     |2={{clade\n       |label1=Nearctic spp.\n       |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n           |1=''[[Myotis californicus|M. californicus]]''\n           |2=''[[Myotis leibii|M. leibii]] }}\n         |2={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n             |1=''[[Myotis septentrionalis|M. septentrionalis]]''\n             |2=''[[Myotis auriculus|M. auriculus]]'' }}\n           |2={{clade\n             |1={{clade\n               |1=''[[Myotis sodalis|M. sodalis]]''\n               |2=''[[Myotis volans|M. volans]]'' }}\n             |2={{clade\n               |1={{clade\n                 |1=<big>'''''M. lucifugus'''</big>\n                 |2=''[[Myotis occultus|M. occultus]]'' }}\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Myotis thysanodes|M. thysanodes]]''\n                  |2={{clade\n                    |1=''[[Myotis evotis|M. evotis]]''\n                    |2=''[[Myotis keenii|M. keenii]]'' }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }}\nThe little brown bat was [[species description|described]] as a new species in 1831 by American naturalist [[John Eatton Le Conte]].\nIt was initially in the genus ''[[Vespertilio]]'', with a binomial of ''Vespertilio lucifugus''.<ref name=\"Le Conte 1831\">{{cite journal|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.41463|title=The animal kingdom arranged in conformity with its organization / by the Baron Cuvier; the Crustacea, Arachnides and Insecta, by P.A.

Torpor saves energy for the bat when ambient temperatures are below {{cvt|39|C|F}} throughout the year and {{cvt|32|C|F}} in the winter; instead of expending energy to maintain a constant body temperature, it allows its body to cool and physiological activity to slow. While in torpor, its heart rate drops from up to 210 beats per minute to as few as 8 beats per minute. The exception to this rule is females at the end of pregnancy, which no longer have the ability to thermoregulate, and therefore must roost in warm places. During daily roosting, it can cope with high levels of water loss of up to 25%.<ref name=\"Fenton 1980\"/>\n\nIn the winter time, it enters a prolonged state of torpor known as [[hibernation]]. To conserve energy, it limits how frequently it arouses from torpor, with individuals existing in uninterrupted torpor for up to 90 days. Arousal is the most energetically costly phase of torpor, which is why individuals do so infrequently. Despite the energy-saving mechanism of hibernation, individuals lose a quarter of their pre-hibernation body mass during the winter.<ref name=\"Fenton 1980\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe little brown bat can be confused with the [[Indiana bat]] (''M. sodalis'') in appearance.

While it does have a calcar, that of the little brown bat is not nearly as pronounced. Additionally, the little brown bat can be distinguished by the presence of hairs on its toes and feet that extend beyond the length of the digits.<ref name=\"Fenton 1980\"/> The [[Northern long-eared bat (myotis)|northern long-eared bat]] (''M. septentrionalis''), another similar species, can be distinguished by its much longer ears, and tragi that are long and sharply pointed.<ref name=\"WI DNR\"/>\n\n==Biology and ecology==\n===Reproduction and life cycle===\n[[File:Baby Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) - Yellowstone National Park - Waag.jpg|alt=A gloved hand holds a baby little brown bat|thumb|Recently born little brown myotis in maternity colony within Yellowstone National Park]]\nThe little brown bat has a [[Animal sexual behaviour#Polygynandry|promiscuous]] mating structure, meaning that individual bats of both sexes mate with multiple partners.<ref name=\"Thomas 1979\">{{cite journal|first1=Donald W.| last1= Thomas| first2= M.

It has a small body size and glossy brown fur. It is similar in appearance to several other mouse-eared bats, including the [[Indiana bat]], [[Northern long-eared bat (myotis)|northern long-eared bat]], and [[Arizona myotis]], to which it is closely related. Despite its name, the little brown bat is not closely related to the [[big brown bat]], which belongs to a different genus.\n\nIts mating system is [[polygynandry|polygynandrous]], or promiscuous, and females give birth to one offspring annually. The offspring, called pups, are quickly weaned and reach adult size in some dimensions by three weeks old. The little brown bat has a mean lifespan of 6.5 years, though one individual in the wild reached 34 years old. It is [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], foraging for its [[insect]] prey at night and roosting in hollow trees or buildings during the day, among less common roost types. It navigates and locates prey with [[animal echolocation#bats|echolocation]].\n\nIt has few natural predators, but may be killed by [[bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[owl]]s, as well as terrestrial predators such as [[raccoon]]s. Other sources of mortality include diseases such as [[rabies]] and [[white-nose syndrome]]. White-nose syndrome has been a significant cause of mortality since 2006, killing over one million little brown bats by 2011. In the [[Northeastern United States]], population loss has been extreme, with surveyed [[hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernacula]] (caves used for hibernation) averaging a population loss of 90%.\n\nHumans frequently encounter the little brown bat due to its habit of roosting in buildings. Colonies in buildings are often considered [[pest (organism)|pests]] because of the production of waste or the concern of [[rabies]] transmission. Little brown bats rarely test positive for rabies, however. Some people attempt to attract little brown bats to their property, but not their houses, by installing [[Nest box#Bat box construction|bat houses]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{cladogram|align=left|style=width:275px;font-size:85%;line-height:85%|caption=Relationships of Nearctic ''Myotis'' species<ref name=\"Stadelmann 2007\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.06.019|pmid=17049280|title=Molecular phylogeny of New World ''Myotis'' (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA genes|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=43|issue=1|pages=32\u201348|year=2007|last1=Stadelmann|first1=B|last2=Lin|first2=L.K|last3=Kunz|first3=T.H|last4=Ruedi|first4=M}}</ref>\n|cladogram={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n     |1=Old World spp.\n     |2={{clade\n       |label1=Nearctic spp.\n       |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n           |1=''[[Myotis californicus|M. californicus]]''\n           |2=''[[Myotis leibii|M. leibii]] }}\n         |2={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n             |1=''[[Myotis septentrionalis|M. septentrionalis]]''\n             |2=''[[Myotis auriculus|M. auriculus]]'' }}\n           |2={{clade\n             |1={{clade\n               |1=''[[Myotis sodalis|M. sodalis]]''\n               |2=''[[Myotis volans|M. volans]]'' }}\n             |2={{clade\n               |1={{clade\n                 |1=<big>'''''M. lucifugus'''</big>\n                 |2=''[[Myotis occultus|M. occultus]]'' }}\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Myotis thysanodes|M. thysanodes]]''\n                  |2={{clade\n                    |1=''[[Myotis evotis|M. evotis]]''\n                    |2=''[[Myotis keenii|M. keenii]]'' }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }}\nThe little brown bat was [[species description|described]] as a new species in 1831 by American naturalist [[John Eatton Le Conte]].\nIt was initially in the genus ''[[Vespertilio]]'', with a binomial of ''Vespertilio lucifugus''.<ref name=\"Le Conte 1831\">{{cite journal|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.41463|title=The animal kingdom arranged in conformity with its organization / by the Baron Cuvier; the Crustacea, Arachnides and Insecta, by P.A.

Torpor saves energy for the bat when ambient temperatures are below {{cvt|39|C|F}} throughout the year and {{cvt|32|C|F}} in the winter; instead of expending energy to maintain a constant body temperature, it allows its body to cool and physiological activity to slow. While in torpor, its heart rate drops from up to 210 beats per minute to as few as 8 beats per minute. The exception to this rule is females at the end of pregnancy, which no longer have the ability to thermoregulate, and therefore must roost in warm places. During daily roosting, it can cope with high levels of water loss of up to 25%.<ref name=\"Fenton 1980\"/>\n\nIn the winter time, it enters a prolonged state of torpor known as [[hibernation]]. To conserve energy, it limits how frequently it arouses from torpor, with individuals existing in uninterrupted torpor for up to 90 days. Arousal is the most energetically costly phase of torpor, which is why individuals do so infrequently. Despite the energy-saving mechanism of hibernation, individuals lose a quarter of their pre-hibernation body mass during the winter.<ref name=\"Fenton 1980\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe little brown bat can be confused with the [[Indiana bat]] (''M. sodalis'') in appearance. The two can be differentiated by the little brown bat's lack of a keeled [[calcar]]&mdash;the cartilaginous spur on its [[interfemoral membrane|uropatagium]] (the flight membrane between its hind legs). While it does have a calcar, that of the little brown bat is not nearly as pronounced. Additionally, the little brown bat can be distinguished by the presence of hairs on its toes and feet that extend beyond the length of the digits.<ref name=\"Fenton 1980\"/> The [[Northern long-eared bat (myotis)|northern long-eared bat]] (''M. septentrionalis''), another similar species, can be distinguished by its much longer ears, and tragi that are long and sharply pointed.<ref name=\"WI DNR\"/>\n\n==Biology and ecology==\n===Reproduction and life cycle===\n[[File:Baby Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) - Yellowstone National Park - Waag.jpg|alt=A gloved hand holds a baby little brown bat|thumb|Recently born little brown myotis in maternity colony within Yellowstone National Park]]\nThe little brown bat has a [[Animal sexual behaviour#Polygynandry|promiscuous]] mating structure, meaning that individual bats of both sexes mate with multiple partners.<ref name=\"Thomas 1979\">{{cite journal|first1=Donald W.| last1= Thomas| first2= M.

By 1928, the APOC's shareholding in TPC, which by now was named [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), was reduced to 23.75%; as the result of the changing geopolitics post [[Ottoman empire]] break-up, and the [[Red Line Agreement]].<ref name=\"GT-DEX-1920-78\"/> Relations were generally cordial between the pro-west [[Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Monarchy (1932\u201358)]] in Iraq and IPC, in spite of disputes centered on Iraq's wish for greater involvement and more royalties.

In Iran, the AIOC and the pro-western Iranian government led by Prime Minister [[Ali Razmara]] resisted nationalist calls to revise AIOC's concession terms in Iran's favour. In March 1951, Razmara was assassinated and [[Mohammed Mossadeq]], a nationalist, was elected as the new prime minister by the [[Majlis of Iran]] (parliament).<ref name=\"Ref-B-William1991\"/> In April 1951, the Iranian government [[Nationalization|nationalised]] the Iranian oil industry by unanimous vote, and the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC) was formed, displacing the AIOC.<ref name=\"NYTRoots\"/><ref name=\"BPHistory\"/> The AIOC withdrew its management from Iran, and Britain organized an effective worldwide embargo of Iranian oil.

The government issued a Corrective Action Order to BP XA that addressed the pipeline's risks and ordered pipeline repair or replacement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had investigated the extent of the oil spills and oversaw BPXA's cleanup. When BP XA did not fully comply with the terms of the corrective action, a complaint was filed in March 2009 alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Pipeline Safety Act.  In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska entered a consent decree between the United States and BPXA resolving the government's claims.  Under the consent decree, BPXA paid a $25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill, and agreed to take measures to significantly improve inspection and maintenance of its pipeline infrastructure on the North Slope to reduce the threat of additional oil spills.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/5812.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.

The oil discovery led to petrochemical industry development and also the establishment of industries that strongly depended on oil.

When the equipment malfunctioned and caught fire, BP workers shut it down and routed escaping gases to flares. Rather than shut down associated units while compressor repairs were made, BP chose to keep operating those other units, which led to unlawful release of contaminants for almost 40 days.

The government issued a Corrective Action Order to BP XA that addressed the pipeline's risks and ordered pipeline repair or replacement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had investigated the extent of the oil spills and oversaw BPXA's cleanup. When BP XA did not fully comply with the terms of the corrective action, a complaint was filed in March 2009 alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Pipeline Safety Act.  In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska entered a consent decree between the United States and BPXA resolving the government's claims.  Under the consent decree, BPXA paid a $25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill, and agreed to take measures to significantly improve inspection and maintenance of its pipeline infrastructure on the North Slope to reduce the threat of additional oil spills.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/5812.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.

Released in November 1998 as the fourth single from ''[[Up & Down - The Party Album]]'', the song became one of the band's most successful hits, topping the chart in Flemish Belgium, reaching number two in Australia and the Netherlands, and becoming a top-five hit in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It is also the band's highest-charting song in the United States, climbing to number 26 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and in Canada, where it peaked at number 10.\n\n==Composition==\n\"We Like to Party! (The Vengabus)\" is a [[Eurodance]] song that runs for 3 minutes and 41 seconds. It is written in the key of [[A-flat major]] and maintains a [[tempo]] of 136 beats per minute in common time.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics. [[AllMusic]] editor William Cooper described the song as a \"bouncy Eurodisco hit\" and noted further that it was \"reminiscent of Aqua's \"Barbie Girl\", with its singalong chorus, cutesy female vocal squeal, and wacky synth beats.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-party-album%21-mw0000237492|title=Vengaboys - The Party Album!|work=AllMusic|date=|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote, \"This wildly energetic foursome (two gals, two guys) from the Netherlands is pretty much a household name throughout Europe, where this infectious pop gem has been a constant on radio and in clubs. Already, \"We Like To Party!\" has gone platinum and double-platinum in Belgium and the act's homeland, respectively. Here, the song could meet a similar fate, especially since it features a sugar-soaked sing-along chorus that hangs out in your head until you beg for relief. That said, people who embraced [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]'s \"[[Barbie Girl]]\", [[Cleopatra (girl group)|Cleopatra]]'s \"Romeo And Juliet\", and [[Los Del Rio]]'s \"[[Macarena]]\" will be lining up for this latest slice of energetic pop. Are you listening, radio? (It's already hit No. 1 on the playlist of dance leader WKTU New York.) Conversely, this will be a no-brainer for club jocks, who continue to make major noise with the group's sweat-soaked debut, \"[[Up and Down (song)|Up and Down]]\".\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1999/BB-1999-01-09.pdf|title=Billboard: Single Reviews|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=9 January 1999|page=15|accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref> Jim Farber from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented, \"Attention, lovers of cheeseball club music. The Vengaboys' hit \"We Like to Party!\" combines a campy disco beat, party-girl vocals, and a killer hook in the form of a ship horn in full blare. What began as a beach anthem in [[Ibiza]], Spain, is becoming a Stateside smash on the increasingly Euro-driven U.S. charts. And why not? It's too willfully silly to resist.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1999/04/16/we-party/|title=We Like to Party!|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=16 April 1999|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe song became the group's biggest hit in the United States, peaking at number 26 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and selling 405,000 copies.<ref name=\"hot100\"/><ref name=\"ussales\">Billboard - 25 Dec 1999 - 1 Jan 2000 - Page 34 \"Vengaboys' \"We Like To Party!

Released in November 1998 as the fourth single from ''[[Up & Down - The Party Album]]'', the song became one of the band's most successful hits, topping the chart in Flemish Belgium, reaching number two in Australia and the Netherlands, and becoming a top-five hit in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It is also the band's highest-charting song in the United States, climbing to number 26 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and in Canada, where it peaked at number 10.\n\n==Composition==\n\"We Like to Party! (The Vengabus)\" is a [[Eurodance]] song that runs for 3 minutes and 41 seconds. It is written in the key of [[A-flat major]] and maintains a [[tempo]] of 136 beats per minute in common time.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics. [[AllMusic]] editor William Cooper described the song as a \"bouncy Eurodisco hit\" and noted further that it was \"reminiscent of Aqua's \"Barbie Girl\", with it's singalong chorus, cutesy female vocal squeal, and wacky synth beats.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-party-album%21-mw0000237492|title=Vengaboys - The Party Album!|work=AllMusic|date=|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote, \"This wildly energetic foursome (two gals, two guys) from the Netherlands is pretty much a household name throughout Europe, where this infectious pop gem has been a constant on radio and in clubs. Already, \"We Like To Party!\" has gone platinum and double-platinum in Belgium and the act's homeland, respectively. Here, the song could meet a similar fate, especially since it features a sugar-soaked sing-along chorus that hangs out in your head until you beg for relief. That said, people who embraced [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]'s \"[[Barbie Girl]]\", [[Cleopatra (girl group)|Cleopatra]]'s \"Romeo And Juliet\", and [[Los Del Rio]]'s \"[[Macarena]]\" will be lining up for this latest slice of energetic pop. Are you listening, radio? (It's already hit No. 1 on the playlist of dance leader WKTU New York.) Conversely, this will be a no-brainer for club jocks, who continue to make major noise with the group's sweat-soaked debut, \"[[Up and Down (song)|Up and Down]]\".\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1999/BB-1999-01-09.pdf|title=Billboard: Single Reviews|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=9 January 1999|page=15|accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref> Jim Farber from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented, \"Attention, lovers of cheeseball club music. The Vengaboys' hit \"We Like to Party!\" combines a campy disco beat, party-girl vocals, and a killer hook in the form of a ship horn in full blare. What began as a beach anthem in [[Ibiza]], Spain, is becoming a Stateside smash on the increasingly Euro-driven U.S. charts. And why not? It's too willfully silly to resist.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1999/04/16/we-party/|title=We Like to Party!|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=16 April 1999|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref> \n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe song became the group's biggest hit in the United States, peaking at number 26 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and selling 405,000 copies.<ref name=\"hot100\"/><ref name=\"ussales\">Billboard - 25 Dec 1999 - 1 Jan 2000 - Page 34 \"Vengaboys' \"We Like To Party!
