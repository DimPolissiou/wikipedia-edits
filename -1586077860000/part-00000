Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect ([[tax break]]s, insurance, low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, rent rebates).<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\">{{cite web|title=Collins Dictionary of Economics|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/subsidy?showCookiePolicy=true|access-date=2013-09-05}}</ref><ref name=NakedCapitalism-2014-06-03>[http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/06/good-economic-development-deal.html Is That a Good State/Local Economic Development Deal? A Checklist] (2014-06-03), ''[[Naked Capitalism]]''</ref>\n\nFurthermore, they can be broad or narrow, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical. The most common forms of subsidies are those to the producer or the consumer. Producer/production subsidies ensure producers are better off by either supplying market price support, direct support, or payments to factors of production.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\">{{cite book|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-55963-835-7|author2=Kent, J.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/perversesubsidie00myer}}</ref> Consumer/consumption subsidies commonly reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer. For example, in the US at one time it was cheaper to buy gasoline than bottled water.<ref name=\"Myers 1998a\">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Lifting the veil on perverse subsidies|journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=392|issue=6674|pages=327\u2013328|doi=10.1038/32761}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Production subsidy===\nA production subsidy encourages suppliers to increase the output of a particular product by partially offsetting the production costs or losses.<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\" /> The objective of production subsidies is to expand production of a particular product more so that the market would promote but without raising the final price to consumers. This type of subsidy is predominantly found in developed markets.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\" /> Other examples of production subsidies include the assistance in the creation of a new firm ([[Enterprise Investment Scheme]]), industry ([[industrial policy]]) and even the development of certain areas ([[regional policy]]). Production subsidies are critically discussed in the literature as they can cause many problems including the additional cost of storing the extra produced products, depressing world market prices, and incentivizing producers to [[over-produce]], for example, a farmer overproducing in terms of his land's [[carrying capacity]].\n\n===Consumer/consumption subsidy===\nA consumption subsidy is one that subsidises the behaviour of consumers. This type of subsidies are most common in [[developing countries]] where governments subsidise such things as food, water, electricity and education on the basis that no matter how impoverished, all should be allowed those most basic requirements.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\" /> For example, some governments offer 'lifeline' rates for electricity, that is, the first increment of electricity each month is subsidised.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\" />  Evidence from recent studies suggests that government expenditures on subsidies remain high in many countries, often amounting to several percentage points of GDP. Subsidization on such a scale implies substantial opportunity costs. There are at least three compelling reasons for studying government subsidy behavior. First, subsidies are a major instrument of government expenditure policy. Second, on a domestic level, subsidies affect domestic resource allocation decisions, income distribution, and expenditure productivity.\n\n===Export subsidy===\nAn export subsidy is a support from the government for products that are exported, as a means of assisting the country's balance of payments.<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\" /> [[Usha Haley]] and [[George Haley]] identified the subsidies to manufacturing industry provided by the Chinese government and how they have altered trade patterns.<ref name=\"Haley and Haley 2013\">{{cite book|last=Haley |first=U. |title=Subsidies to Chinese Industry |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576680-new-book-lays-out-scale-chinas-industrial-subsidies-perverse-advantage |author2=G. Haley}}</ref> Traditionally, economists have argued that subsidies benefit consumers but hurt the subsidizing countries. Haley and Haley provided data to show that over the decade after China joined the [[World Trade Organization]] industrial subsidies have helped give China an advantage in industries in which they previously enjoyed no comparative advantage such as the steel, glass, paper, auto parts, and solar industries.<ref name=\"Haley and Haley 2013\"/>\n\nExport subsidy is known for being abused. For example, some exporters substantially over declare the value of their goods so as to benefit more from the export subsidy. Another method is to export a batch of goods to a foreign country but the same goods will be re-imported by the same trader via a circuitous route and changing the product description so as to obscure their origin. Thus the trader benefits from the export subsidy without creating real trade value to the economy. Export subsidy as such can become a self-defeating and disruptive policy.\n\n===Import subsidy===\nAn import subsidy is support from the government for products that are imported. Rarer than an export subsidy, an import subsidy further reduces the price to consumers for imported goods. Import subsidies have various effects depending on the subject. For example, consumers in the importing country are better off and experience an increase in consumer welfare due to the decrease in price of the imported goods, as well as the decrease in price of the domestic substitute goods. Conversely, the consumers in the exporting country experience a decrease in consumer welfare due to an increase in the price of their domestic goods. Furthermore, producers of the importing country experience a loss of welfare due to a decrease of the price for the good in their market, while on the other side, the exporters of the producing country experience an increase in well being due to the increase in demand. Ultimately, the import subsidy is rarely used due to an overall loss of welfare for the country due to a decrease in domestic production and a reduction in production throughout the world. However, that can result in a redistribution of income.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Suranovic|first1=Steven|title=Welfare Effects of a VIE/Import Subsidy: Large Country|url=http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch90/T90-31.php|website=International Trade Theory and Policy |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Employment subsidy===\nAn employment subsidy serves as an incentive to businesses to provide more job opportunities to reduce the level of unemployment in the country (income subsidies) or to encourage research and development.<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\" /> With an employment subsidy, the government provides assistance with wages. Another form of employment subsidy is the social security benefits. Employment subsidies allow a person receiving the benefit to enjoy some minimum standard of living.\n\n===Tax subsidy===\nGovernment can create the same outcome through selective tax breaks as through cash payment.<ref name=NakedCapitalism-2014-06-03/> For example, suppose a government sends monetary assistance that reimburses 15% of all health expenditures to a group that is paying 15% income tax. Exactly the same subsidy is achieved by giving a health tax deduction. Tax subsidies are also known as [[tax expenditures]].\n\nTax breaks are often considered to be a subsidy. Like other subsidies, they distort the economy; but tax breaks are also less transparent, and are difficult to undo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 3: Subsidy types|url=https://www.iisd.org/gsi/subsidy-types|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905082615/http://www.iisd.org/gsi/subsidy-types|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-05|website=Global Subsidies Initiative|publisher=IISD|access-date=2015-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Transport subsidies===\nSome governments subsidise transport, especially rail and bus transport, which decrease congestion and pollution compared to cars. In the EU, [[rail subsidies]] are around \u20ac73 billion, and Chinese subsidies reach $130 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_3/download |title=EU Technical Report 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/china-to-invest-128-billion-in-rail-expand-global-market-share |title=China to Invest $128 Billion in Rail, Push for Global Share}}</ref>\n\nPublicly-owned airports can be an indirect subsidy if they lose money. The European Union, for instance, criticizes Germany for its high number of money-losing airports that are used primarily by [[low cost carrier]]s, characterizing the arrangement as an illegal subsidy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many countries, roads and highways are paid for through general revenue, rather than tolls or other dedicated sources that are paid only by road users, creating an indirect subsidy for road transportation. The fact that long-distance buses in Germany do not pay tolls has been called an indirect subsidy by critics, who point to track access charges for railways.\n\n===Oil subsidies===\n{{globalize|section|United States|date=September 2019}}\nAn [[oil subsidy]] is one aimed at decreasing the overall price of oil.\nOil subsidies have always played a major part in U.S. history. These began as early as World War I and have increased in the following decades. However, due to changes in the perceptions of the environment, in 2012 President Barack Obama ended the subsidies to the oil industry, which were, at the time, $4 billion.<ref name=amad>{{cite web|last1=Amadeo|first1=Kimberly|title=Government Subsidies (Farm, Oil, Export, etc.)|url=https://www.thebalance.com/government-subsidies-definition-farm-oil-export-etc-3305788|website=The Balance |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> The Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]] called for an end of subsidies for fossil fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/05/1039241|title=End fossil fuel subsidies, and stop using taxpayers\u2019 money to destroy the world: Guterres|date=2019-05-28|website=UN News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Housing subsidies===\nHousing subsidies are designed to promote the construction industry and homeownership. As of 2018, U.S housing subsidies total around $15 billion per year. Housing subsidies can come in two types; assistance with down payment and interest rate subsidies. The deduction of mortgage interest from the federal income tax accounts for the largest interest rate subsidy. Additionally, the federal government will help low-income families with the down payment, coming to $10.9 million in 2008.<ref name=amad /> Removing energy subsidies is viewed as a necessary measure to combat greenhouse gas emissions as it helps decrease energy consumption.<ref>Indra Overland (2010) \u2018Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective\u2019, ''International Journal of Environmental Studies'', Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515305</ref>\n\n===Environmental externalities===\nAs well as the conventional and formal subsidies as outlined above there are myriad implicit subsidies principally in the form of environmental [[Externality|externalities]].<ref name=\"Myers 1998a\" /> These subsidies include anything that is omitted but not accounted for and thus is an externality. These include things such as car drivers who pollute everyone's atmosphere without compensating everyone, farmers who use [[pesticides]] which can pollute everyone's ecosystems again without compensating everyone, or Britain's electricity production which results in additional [[acid rain]] in Scandinavia.<ref name=\"Myers 1998a\" /><ref name=\"Myers 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse Priorities|journal=IUCN Opinion Piece|year=2008|pages=6\u20137|url=https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/00_w_c_2008_02_perverse.pdf}}</ref> In these examples the polluter is effectively gaining a net benefit but not compensating those affected. Although they are not subsidies in the form of direct economic support from the Government, they are no less economically, socially and environmentally harmful.\n\nA 2015 report studied the implicit subsidies accruing to 20 fossil fuel companies and found that, while highly profitable, the hidden economic cost to society was also large.<ref name=\"hope-etal-2015\">\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Chris | last1 = Hope\n | first2 = Paul | last2 = Gilding\n | first3 = Jimena | last3 = Alvarez\n | title = Quantifying the implicit climate subsidy received by leading fossil fuel companies \u2014 Working Paper No. 02/2015\n | year = 2015\n | publisher = Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge\n | place = Cambridge, UK\n | url = http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/workingpapers/wp1502.pdf\n | access-date = 27 June 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=\"judge-business-school-2015\">\n{{cite web\n | title = Measuring fossil fuel 'hidden' costs\n | date = 23 July 2015\n | url = http://insight.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2015/measuring-fossil-fuel-hidden-costs/\n | website = University of Cambridge Judge Business School\n | access-date = 27 June 2016\n}}</ref> The report spans the period 2008\u20132012 and notes that: \"for all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their {{CO2}} emissions was greater than their after\u2010tax profit, with the single exception of [[ExxonMobil]] in 2008.\"<ref name=\"hope-etal-2015\"/>{{rp|4}} Pure coal companies fare even worse: \"the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue (employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment) in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue.\"<ref name=\"hope-etal-2015\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\n==Categorising subsidies==\n\n===Broad and narrow===\nThese various subsidies can be divided into broad and narrow. Narrow subsidies are those monetary transfers that are easily identifiable and have a clear intent. They are commonly characterised by a monetary transfer between governments and institutions or businesses and individuals. A classic example is a government payment to a farmer.<ref name=\"Myers 2008\" />\n\nConversely broad subsidies include both monetary and non-monetary subsidies and is often difficult to identify.<ref name=\"Myers 2008\" /> A broad subsidy is less attributable and less transparent. Environmental externalities are the most common type of broad subsidy.\n\n==Economic effects==\n[[File:Subsidy- visualization.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0]]\n\nCompetitive equilibrium is a state of balance between buyers and suppliers, in which the quantity demanded of a good is the quantity supplied at a specified price. When the quantity demand exceeds the equilibrium quantity, price falls; conversely, a reduction in the supply of a good beyond equilibrium quantity implies an increase in the price.<ref name=\"Ameg\">Amegashie, J. A. (2006). The Economics of Subsidies. Crossroads , 6 (2), 7-15.</ref> The effect of a subsidy is to shift the supply or demand curve to the right (i.e. increases the supply or demand) by the amount of the subsidy. If a consumer is receiving the subsidy, a lower price of a good resulting from the marginal subsidy on consumption increases demand, shifting the demand curve to the right. If a supplier is receiving the subsidy, an increase in the price (revenue) resulting from the marginal subsidy on production results increases supply, shifting the supply curve to the right.\n\n[[File:Subsidy - visualization 2.tiff|thumb|upright=2.0]]\n\nAssuming the market is in a perfectly competitive equilibrium, a subsidy increases the supply of the good beyond the equilibrium competitive quantity. The imbalance creates deadweight loss. Deadweight loss from a subsidy is the amount by which the cost of the subsidy exceeds the gains of the subsidy.<ref name=\"watkins\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Watkins | first = Thayer\n | title = The Impact of an Excise Tax or Subsidy on Price\n | website = San Jos\u00e9 State University Department of Economics\n | url = http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/taximpact.htm\n | access-date = 2016-06-28\n}}\n</ref> The magnitude of the deadweight loss is dependent on the size of the subsidy. This is considered a market failure, or inefficiency.<ref name=\"watkins\"/>\n\nSubsidies targeted at goods in one country, by lowering the price of those goods, make them more competitive against foreign goods, thereby reducing foreign competition.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\">{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=R.W.|title=Encyclopedia of business ethics and society|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412916523|chapter=Subsidies}}</ref> As a result, many developing countries cannot engage in foreign trade, and receive lower prices for their products in the global market. This is considered protectionism: a government policy to erect trade barriers in order to protect domestic industries.<ref>Protectionism. (2006). Collins Dictionary</ref> The problem with [[protectionism]] arises when industries are selected for nationalistic reasons (Infant-Industry), rather than to gain a comparative advantage. The market distortion, and reduction in social welfare, is the logic behind the World Bank policy for the removal of subsidies in developing countries.<ref name=\"Ameg\"/>\n\nSubsidies create spillover effects in other economic sectors and industries. A subsidized product sold in the world market lowers the price of the good in other countries. Since subsidies result in lower revenues for producers of foreign countries, they are a source of tension between the United States, Europe and poorer developing countries.<ref name=\"Parkin et al. 2007\">{{cite book |last1=Parkin |first1=M. |last2=Powell |first2=M. |last3=Matthews |first3=K. |date=2007 |title=Economics |edition=7th |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Harlow |isbn=978-0132041225}}</ref> While subsidies may provide immediate benefits to an industry, in the long-run they may prove to have unethical, negative effects. Subsidies are intended to support public interest, however, they can violate ethical or legal principles if they lead to higher consumer prices or discriminate against some producers to benefit others.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\"/> For example, domestic subsidies granted by individual US states may be unconstitutional if they discriminate against out-of-state producers, violating the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\"/> Depending on their nature, subsidies are discouraged by international trade agreements such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).

It was developed extensively in the EU and USA across the two World Wars and the Great Depression to protect domestic food production, but remains important across the world today.<ref name=\"Robin et al 2003\" /><ref name=\"Myers 1996\" /> In 2005, US farmers received $14 billion and EU farmers $47 billion in [[agricultural subsidies]].<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\"/> Today, agricultural subsidies are defended on the grounds of helping farmers to maintain their livelihoods.

The subsidy payments stimulated [[overproduction]] and resulted in a record cotton harvest in 2002, much of which had to be sold at very reduced prices in the global market.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\" /> For foreign producers, the depressed cotton price lowered their prices far below the break-even price. In fact, African farmers received 35 to 40 cents per pound for cotton, while US cotton growers, backed by government agricultural payments, received 75 cents per pound. Developing countries and trade organizations argue that poorer countries should be able to export their principal commodities to survive, but protectionist laws and payments in the United States and Europe prevent these countries from engaging in international trade opportunities.\n\n====Fisheries====\nToday, much of the world's major fisheries are [[overexploited]]; in 2002, the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] estimate this at approximately 75%.

First are direct financial transfers, second are indirect financial transfers and services. Third, certain forms of intervention and fourth, not intervening. The first category regards direct payments from the government received by the fisheries industry. These typically affect profits of the industry in the short term and can be negative or positive. Category two pertains to government intervention, not involving those under the first category. These subsidies also affect the profits in the short term but typically are not negative. Category three includes intervention that results in a negative short-term economic impact, but economic benefits in the long term. These benefits are usually more general societal benefits such as the environment.  The final category pertains to inaction by the government, allowing producers to impose certain production costs on others. These subsidies tend to lead to positive benefits in the short term but negative in the long term.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report of the Expert Consultation on Identifying, Assessing and Reporting on Subsidies in the Fishing Industry - Rome, 3-6 December 2002|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4446e/y4446e0l.htm|website=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Others====\nThe US National Football League's ([[NFL]]) profits have topped records at $11 billion, the highest of all sports.

Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect ([[tax break]]s, insurance, low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, rent rebates).<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\">{{cite web|title=Collins Dictionary of Economics|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/subsidy?showCookiePolicy=true|access-date=2013-09-05}}</ref><ref name=NakedCapitalism-2014-06-03>[http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/06/good-economic-development-deal.html Is That a Good State/Local Economic Development Deal?

The most common forms of subsidies are those to the producer or the consumer. Producer/production subsidies ensure producers are better off by either supplying market price support, direct support, or payments to factors of production.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\">{{cite book|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-55963-835-7|author2=Kent, J.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/perversesubsidie00myer}}</ref> Consumer/consumption subsidies commonly reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer. For example, in the US at one time it was cheaper to buy gasoline than bottled water.<ref name=\"Myers 1998a\">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Lifting the veil on perverse subsidies|journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=392|issue=6674|pages=327\u2013328|doi=10.1038/32761}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Production subsidy===\nA production subsidy encourages suppliers to increase the output of a particular product by partially offsetting the production costs or losses.<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\" /> The objective of production subsidies is to expand production of a particular product more so that the market would promote but without raising the final price to consumers. This type of subsidy is predominantly found in developed markets.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\" /> Other examples of production subsidies include the assistance in the creation of a new firm ([[Enterprise Investment Scheme]]), industry ([[industrial policy]]) and even the development of certain areas ([[regional policy]]). Production subsidies are critically discussed in the literature as they can cause many problems including the additional cost of storing the extra produced products, depressing world market prices, and incentivizing producers to [[over-produce]], for example, a farmer overproducing in terms of his land's [[carrying capacity]].\n\n===Consumer/consumption subsidy===\nA consumption subsidy is one that subsidises the behaviour of consumers. This type of subsidies are most common in [[developing countries]] where governments subsidise such things as food, water, electricity and education on the basis that no matter how impoverished, all should be allowed those most basic requirements.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\" /> For example, some governments offer 'lifeline' rates for electricity, that is, the first increment of electricity each month is subsidised.<ref name=\"cheapMyers and Kent 2001\" />  Evidence from recent studies suggests that government expenditures on subsidies remain high in many countries, often amounting to several percentage points of GDP. Subsidization on such a scale implies substantial opportunity costs. There are at least three compelling reasons for studying government subsidy behavior. First, subsidies are a major instrument of government expenditure policy. Second, on a domestic level, subsidies affect domestic resource allocation decisions, income distribution, and expenditure productivity.\n\n===Export subsidy===\nAn export subsidy is a support from the government for products that are exported, as a means of assisting the country's balance of payments.<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\" /> [[Usha Haley]] and [[George Haley]] identified the subsidies to manufacturing industry provided by the Chinese government and how they have altered trade patterns.<ref name=\"Haley and Haley 2013\">{{cite book|last=Haley |first=U. |title=Subsidies to Chinese Industry |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576680-new-book-lays-out-scale-chinas-industrial-subsidies-perverse-advantage |author2=G. Haley}}</ref> Traditionally, economists have argued that subsidies benefit consumers but hurt the subsidizing countries. Haley and Haley provided data to show that over the decade after China joined the [[World Trade Organization]] industrial subsidies have helped give China an advantage in industries in which they previously enjoyed no comparative advantage such as the steel, glass, paper, auto parts, and solar industries.<ref name=\"Haley and Haley 2013\"/>\n\nExport subsidy is known for being abused. For example, some exporters substantially over declare the value of their goods so as to benefit more from the export subsidy. Another method is to export a batch of goods to a foreign country but the same goods will be re-imported by the same trader via a circuitous route and changing the product description so as to obscure their origin. Thus the trader benefits from the export subsidy without creating real trade value to the economy. Export subsidy as such can become a self-defeating and disruptive policy.\n\n===Import subsidy===\nAn import subsidy is support from the government for products that are imported. Rarer than an export subsidy, an import subsidy further reduces the price to consumers for imported goods. Import subsidies have various effects depending on the subject. For example, consumers in the importing country are better off and experience an increase in consumer welfare due to the decrease in price of the imported goods, as well as the decrease in price of the domestic substitute goods. Conversely, the consumers in the exporting country experience a decrease in consumer welfare due to an increase in the price of their domestic goods. Furthermore, producers of the importing country experience a loss of welfare due to a decrease of the price for the good in their market, while on the other side, the exporters of the producing country experience an increase in well being due to the increase in demand. Ultimately, the import subsidy is rarely used due to an overall loss of welfare for the country due to a decrease in domestic production and a reduction in production throughout the world. However, that can result in a redistribution of income.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Suranovic|first1=Steven|title=Welfare Effects of a VIE/Import Subsidy: Large Country|url=http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch90/T90-31.php|website=International Trade Theory and Policy |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Employment subsidy===\nAn employment subsidy serves as an incentive to businesses to provide more job opportunities to reduce the level of unemployment in the country (income subsidies) or to encourage research and development.<ref name=\"Collins Dictionary\" /> With an employment subsidy, the government provides assistance with wages. Another form of employment subsidy is the social security benefits. Employment subsidies allow a person receiving the benefit to enjoy some minimum standard of living.\n\n===Tax subsidy===\nGovernment can create the same outcome through selective tax breaks as through cash payment.<ref name=NakedCapitalism-2014-06-03/> For example, suppose a government sends monetary assistance that reimburses 15% of all health expenditures to a group that is paying 15% income tax. Exactly the same subsidy is achieved by giving a health tax deduction. Tax subsidies are also known as [[tax expenditures]].\n\nTax breaks are often considered to be a subsidy. Like other subsidies, they distort the economy; but tax breaks are also less transparent, and are difficult to undo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 3: Subsidy types|url=https://www.iisd.org/gsi/subsidy-types|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905082615/http://www.iisd.org/gsi/subsidy-types|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-05|website=Global Subsidies Initiative|publisher=IISD|access-date=2015-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Transport subsidies===\nSome governments subsidise transport, especially rail and bus transport, which decrease congestion and pollution compared to cars. In the EU, [[rail subsidies]] are around \u20ac73 billion, and Chinese subsidies reach $130 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_3/download |title=EU Technical Report 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/china-to-invest-128-billion-in-rail-expand-global-market-share |title=China to Invest $128 Billion in Rail, Push for Global Share}}</ref>\n\nPublicly-owned airports can be an indirect subsidy if they lose money. The European Union, for instance, criticizes Germany for its high number of money-losing airports that are used primarily by [[low cost carrier]]s, characterizing the arrangement as an illegal subsidy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many countries, roads and highways are paid for through general revenue, rather than tolls or other dedicated sources that are paid paid only by road users, creating an indirect subsidy for road transportation. The fact that long-distance buses in Germany do not pay tolls has been called an indirect subsidy by critics, who point to track access charges for railways.\n\n===Oil subsidies===\n{{globalize|section|United States|date=September 2019}}\nAn [[oil subsidy]] is one aimed at decreasing the overall price of oil.\nOil subsidies have always played a major part in U.S. history. These began as early as World War I and have increased in the following decades. However, due to changes in the perceptions of the environment, in 2012 President Barack Obama ended the subsidies to the oil industry, which were, at the time, $4 billion.<ref name=amad>{{cite web|last1=Amadeo|first1=Kimberly|title=Government Subsidies (Farm, Oil, Export, etc.)|url=https://www.thebalance.com/government-subsidies-definition-farm-oil-export-etc-3305788|website=The Balance |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> The Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]] called for an end of subsidies for fossil fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/05/1039241|title=End fossil fuel subsidies, and stop using taxpayers\u2019 money to destroy the world: Guterres|date=2019-05-28|website=UN News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Housing subsidies===\nHousing subsidies are designed to promote the construction industry and homeownership. As of 2018, U.S housing subsidies total around $15 billion per year. Housing subsidies can come in two types; assistance with down payment and interest rate subsidies. The deduction of mortgage interest from the federal income tax accounts for the largest interest rate subsidy. Additionally, the federal government will help low-income families with the down payment, coming to $10.9 million in 2008.<ref name=amad /> Removing energy subsidies is viewed as a necessary measure to combat greenhouse gas emissions as it helps decrease energy consumption.<ref>Indra Overland (2010) \u2018Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective\u2019, ''International Journal of Environmental Studies'', Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515305</ref>\n\n===Environmental externalities===\nAs well as the conventional and formal subsidies as outlined above there are myriad implicit subsidies principally in the form of environmental [[Externality|externalities]].<ref name=\"Myers 1998a\" /> These subsidies include anything that is omitted but not accounted for and thus is an externality. These include things such as car drivers who pollute everyone's atmosphere without compensating everyone, farmers who use [[pesticides]] which can pollute everyone's ecosystems again without compensating everyone, or Britain's electricity production which results in additional [[acid rain]] in Scandinavia.<ref name=\"Myers 1998a\" /><ref name=\"Myers 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse Priorities|journal=IUCN Opinion Piece|year=2008|pages=6\u20137|url=https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/00_w_c_2008_02_perverse.pdf}}</ref> In these examples the polluter is effectively gaining a net benefit but not compensating those affected. Although they are not subsidies in the form of direct economic support from the Government, they are no less economically, socially and environmentally harmful.\n\nA 2015 report studied the implicit subsidies accruing to 20 fossil fuel companies and found that, while highly profitable, the hidden economic cost to society was also large.<ref name=\"hope-etal-2015\">\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Chris | last1 = Hope\n | first2 = Paul | last2 = Gilding\n | first3 = Jimena | last3 = Alvarez\n | title = Quantifying the implicit climate subsidy received by leading fossil fuel companies \u2014 Working Paper No. 02/2015\n | year = 2015\n | publisher = Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge\n | place = Cambridge, UK\n | url = http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/workingpapers/wp1502.pdf\n | access-date = 27 June 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=\"judge-business-school-2015\">\n{{cite web\n | title = Measuring fossil fuel 'hidden' costs\n | date = 23 July 2015\n | url = http://insight.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2015/measuring-fossil-fuel-hidden-costs/\n | website = University of Cambridge Judge Business School\n | access-date = 27 June 2016\n}}</ref> The report spans the period 2008\u20132012 and notes that: \"for all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their {{CO2}} emissions was greater than their after\u2010tax profit, with the single exception of [[ExxonMobil]] in 2008.\"<ref name=\"hope-etal-2015\"/>{{rp|4}} Pure coal companies fare even worse: \"the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue (employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment) in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue.\"<ref name=\"hope-etal-2015\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\n==Categorising subsidies==\n\n===Broad and narrow===\nThese various subsidies can be divided into broad and narrow. Narrow subsidies are those monetary transfers that are easily identifiable and have a clear intent. They are commonly characterised by a monetary transfer between governments and institutions or businesses and individuals. A classic example is a government payment to a farmer.<ref name=\"Myers 2008\" />\n\nConversely broad subsidies include both monetary and non-monetary subsidies and is often difficult to identify.<ref name=\"Myers 2008\" /> A broad subsidy is less attributable and less transparent. Environmental externalities are the most common type of broad subsidy.\n\n==Economic effects==\n[[File:Subsidy- visualization.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0]]\n\nCompetitive equilibrium is a state of balance between buyers and suppliers, in which the quantity demanded of a good is the quantity supplied at a specified price. When the quantity demand exceeds the equilibrium quantity, price falls; conversely, a reduction in the supply of a good beyond equilibrium quantity implies an increase in the price.<ref name=\"Ameg\">Amegashie, J. A. (2006). The Economics of Subsidies. Crossroads , 6 (2), 7-15.</ref> The effect of a subsidy is to shift the supply or demand curve to the right (i.e. increases the supply or demand) by the amount of the subsidy. If a consumer is receiving the subsidy, a lower price of a good resulting from the marginal subsidy on consumption increases demand, shifting the demand curve to the right. If a supplier is receiving the subsidy, an increase in the price (revenue) resulting from the marginal subsidy on production results increases supply, shifting the supply curve to the right.\n\n[[File:Subsidy - visualization 2.tiff|thumb|upright=2.0]]\n\nAssuming the market is in a perfectly competitive equilibrium, a subsidy increases the supply of the good beyond the equilibrium competitive quantity. The imbalance creates deadweight loss. Deadweight loss from a subsidy is the amount by which the cost of the subsidy exceeds the gains of the subsidy.<ref name=\"watkins\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Watkins | first = Thayer\n | title = The Impact of an Excise Tax or Subsidy on Price\n | website = San Jos\u00e9 State University Department of Economics\n | url = http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/taximpact.htm\n | access-date = 2016-06-28\n}}\n</ref> The magnitude of the deadweight loss is dependent on the size of the subsidy. This is considered a market failure, or inefficiency.<ref name=\"watkins\"/>\n\nSubsidies targeted at goods in one country, by lowering the price of those goods, make them more competitive against foreign goods, thereby reducing foreign competition.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\">{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=R.W.|title=Encyclopedia of business ethics and society|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412916523|chapter=Subsidies}}</ref> As a result, many developing countries cannot engage in foreign trade, and receive lower prices for their products in the global market. This is considered protectionism: a government policy to erect trade barriers in order to protect domestic industries.<ref>Protectionism. (2006). Collins Dictionary</ref> The problem with [[protectionism]] arises when industries are selected for nationalistic reasons (Infant-Industry), rather than to gain a comparative advantage. The market distortion, and reduction in social welfare, is the logic behind the World Bank policy for the removal of subsidies in developing countries.<ref name=\"Ameg\"/>\n\nSubsidies create spillover effects in other economic sectors and industries. A subsidized product sold in the world market lowers the price of the good in other countries. Since subsidies result in lower revenues for producers of foreign countries, they are a source of tension between the United States, Europe and poorer developing countries.<ref name=\"Parkin et al. 2007\">{{cite book |last1=Parkin |first1=M. |last2=Powell |first2=M. |last3=Matthews |first3=K. |date=2007 |title=Economics |edition=7th |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Harlow |isbn=978-0132041225}}</ref> While subsidies may provide immediate benefits to an industry, in the long-run they may prove to have unethical, negative effects. Subsidies are intended to support public interest, however, they can violate ethical or legal principles if they lead to higher consumer prices or discriminate against some producers to benefit others.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\"/> For example, domestic subsidies granted by individual US states may be unconstitutional if they discriminate against out-of-state producers, violating the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.<ref name=\"Kolb 2008\"/> Depending on their nature, subsidies are discouraged by international trade agreements such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). This trend, however, may change in the future, as needs of sustainable development and environmental protection could suggest different interpretations regarding energy and [[renewable energy subsidies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|access-date=}} and {{cite journal|title=WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law|journal=49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International|ssrn=2704453|access-date=}}</ref> In its July 2019 report, \"[http://www.oecd.org/economy/going-for-growth/ Going for Growth 2019: The time for reform is now]\", the [[OECD]] suggests that countries make better use of environmental taxation, phase out agricultural subsidies and environmentally harmful tax breaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/economy/going-for-growth/|title=Going for Growth 2019: The time for reform is now - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/uncertain-global-economy-should-prompt-governments-to-embark-on-reforms-that-boost-sustainable-growth-raise-incomes-and-increase-opportunities-for-all.htm|title=Uncertain global economy should prompt governments to embark on reforms that boost sustainable growth, raise incomes and increase opportunities for all - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Perverse subsidies==\n{{POV section|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Definitions===\nAlthough subsidies can be important, many are \"[[perverse incentive|perverse]]\", in the sense of having adverse [[unintended consequences]].

Developing countries and trade organizations argue that poorer countries should be able to export their principal commodities to survive, but protectionist laws and payments in the United States and Europe prevent these countries from engaging in international trade opportunities.\n\n====Fisheries====\nToday, much of the world's major fisheries are [[overexploited]]; in 2002, the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] estimate this at approximately 75%.

First are direct financial transfers, second are indirect financial transfers and services. Third, certain forms of intervention and fourth, not intervening. The first category regards direct payments from the government received by the fisheries industry. These typically affect profits of the industry in the short term and can be negative or positive. Category two pertains to government intervention, not involving those under the first category. These subsidies also affect the profits in the short term but typically are not negative. Category three includes intervention that results in a negative short-term economic impact, but economic benefits in the long term. These benefits are usually more general societal benefits such as the environment.  The final category pertains to inaction by the government, allowing producers to impose certain production costs on others. These subsidies tend to lead to positive benefits in the short term but negative in the long term.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report of the Expert Consultation on Identifying, Assessing and Reporting on Subsidies in the Fishing Industry - Rome, 3-6 December 2002|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4446e/y4446e0l.htm|website=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Others====\nThe US National Football League's ([[NFL]]) profits have topped records at $11 billion, the highest of all sports.

Joseph Hammer-Purgstall's ''Dictionnaire du language des fleurs'' (1809) appears to be the first published list associating flowers with symbolic definitions, while the first dictionary of floriography appears in 1819 when Louise Cortambert, writing under pen name Madame Charlotte de la Tour, wrote ''Le langage des Fleurs''.\n\nFloriography was popularized in [[France]] during 1810\u20131850, while in Britain it was popular during the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] age (roughly 1820\u20131880), and in the [[United States]] during 1830\u20131850. La Tour's book stimulated the publishing industry especially in France, England, and the United States, but also in [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and other European countries as well as in [[South America]]. Publishers from these countries produced hundreds of editions of floriography books during the 19th century.\n\nBritish floral dictionaries include [[Henry Phillips (horticulturist)|Henry Phillips]]' ''Floral Emblems'' published in 1825 and [[Frederic Shoberl]]'s ''The Language of Flowers; With Illustrative Poetry'', in 1834. Shoberl was the editor of the popular annual \"Forget Me Not\" from 1822 to 1834. [[Robert Tyas]] was a popular British flower writer, publisher, and clergyman, who lived from 1811 to 1879; his book, ''The Sentiment of Flowers; or, Language of Flora'', first published in 1836 and printed through the 1840s, was billed as an English version of [[Charlotte de la Tour]]'s book. One of the most familiar books about floriography is Routledge's edition illustrated by [[Kate Greenaway]], ''The Language of Flowers''. First published in 1884, it continues to be reprinted to this day.\n\nIn the United States the first appearance of the language of flowers in print was in the writings of [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]], a French-American naturalist, who wrote on-going features under the title \"The School of Flora\", from 1827 through 1828, in the weekly [[Saturday Evening Post]] and the monthly ''Casket; or Flowers of Literature, Wit, and Sentiment''. These pieces contained the botanic, English, and French names of the plant, a description of the plant, an explanation of its Latin names, and the flower's emblematic meaning. However, the first books on floriography were [[Elizabeth Wirt]]'s ''Flora's Dictionary'' and [[Dorothea Dix]]'s ''The Garland of Flora'', both of which were published in 1829, though Wirt's book had been issued in an unauthorized edition in 1828.\n\nDuring its peak in the United States, the language of flowers attracted the attention of popular female writers and editors.

Catharine H. Waterman Esling wrote a long poem titled \"The Language of Flowers\", which first appeared in 1839 in her own language of flowers book, ''Flora's Lexicon''; it continued in print through the 1860s. Lucy Hooper, an editor, novelist, poet, and playwright, included several of her flower poems in ''The Lady's Book of Flowers and Poetry'', first published in 1841. [[Frances Sargent Osgood]], a poet and friend of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], first published ''The Poetry of Flowers and Flowers of Poetry'' in 1841, and it continued in print through the 1860s. Osgood edited a special gift book, ''The Floral Offering'', in 1847. [[Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo]], author of several flower books, was associate editor of the Universalist monthly ''[[The Ladies' Repository]]'' in [[Boston]] from 1839 to 1842. Her book, ''The Flower Vase'', was published in 1844. She edited the books ''Fables of Flora'' in 1844 and ''The Floral Fortune Teller'' in 1846. C. M.

John Steinbeck's short story \"[[The Chrysanthemums]]\" centers around the yellow florets, which are often associated with optimism and lost love.

These artists are known for their idealistic portrayal of women, emphasis on nature and morality, and use of literature and mythology. Flowers laden with symbolism figure prominently in much of their work. [[John Everett Millais]], a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, used oils to create pieces filled with naturalistic elements and rich in floriography. His painting ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1852) depicts Shakespeare's drowned stargazer floating amid the flowers she describes in Act IV, Scene V of ''[[Hamlet]]''.[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] (1852) is part of the [[Tate Gallery]] collection.

John Steinbeck's short story \"[[The Chrysanthemums]]\" centers around the yellow florets, which are often associated with optimism and lost love.

Flowers laden with symbolism figure prominently in much of their work.

In live concerts, Bono introduced the song by saying \"I'd like to sing a medley of my hit\". His only other single as a solo artist, \"The Revolution Kind\", reached No. 70 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 later that year.

In the 1975 TV movie ''[[Murder on Flight 502]]'', he played the role of rock star Jack Marshall. He appeared in the 1980 miniseries ''Top of the Hill''. He played the role of mad bomber Joe Selucci in ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and appeared in the horror film ''[[Troll (film)|Troll]]'' (1986). He also portrayed racist entrepreneur Franklin von Tussle in the [[John Waters]] film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988). In ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997), Bono is one of several oddball celebrities seen on a wall of video screens that monitor extraterrestrials living among us. He also appeared as the Mayor of Palm Springs (which he actually was at the time) in several episodes of ''[[P.S. I Luv U]]'' during the 1991\u201392 TV season, and on ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (in Season 1, Episode 9, which aired November 21, 1993), in which he played Mayor Frank Berkowitz. He also made a minor appearance as himself in the comedy film ''[[First Kid]]'' (1996).\n\nBono guest-starred as himself on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' episode \"Mrs. George Devereaux\" (originally broadcast November 17, 1990), in which he vied with [[Lyle Waggoner]] for Dorothy's ([[Bea Arthur]]) affection in a dream sequence. In Blanche's ([[Rue McClanahan]]) dream, her husband is still alive, and Bono uses his power as Mayor of Palm Springs to have Waggoner falsely arrested so he can have Dorothy to himself.\n\n===Political career===\n{{See also|Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act}}\nBono entered politics after experiencing great frustration with local government bureaucracy in trying to open a restaurant in [[Palm Springs, California]]. Bono placed a successful bid to become the new mayor of Palm Springs. He served four years, from 1988 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000622| title=Bono, Sonny \u2013 Biographical Information| publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov| accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref> He was instrumental in spearheading the creation of the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]], which is held each year in Bono's memory.\n\nBono ran for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[United States Senate]] in 1992, but the nomination went to the more conservative [[Bruce Herschensohn]], and the election to the Democrat [[Barbara Boxer]]. Bono and Herschensohn became close friends after the campaign. Bono was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1994 to represent [[California's 44th congressional district]].

Drawing on his long experience as a celebrity and entertainment producer, Bono (according to Maraniss and Weisskopf) recognized that Gingrich's status had changed from politician to celebrity and that he was not making allowances for that change:\n\n{{blockquote|You're a celebrity now, ...

One of his earliest songwriting efforts, \"[[Needles and Pins (song)|Needles and Pins]]\" was co-written with [[Jack Nitzsche]], another member of Spector's production team. Later in the same decade, he achieved commercial success with his wife [[Cher]] in the singing duo [[Sonny and Cher]]. Bono wrote, arranged and produced a number of hit records including the singles \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" and \"[[The Beat Goes On (Sonny & Cher song)|The Beat Goes On]]\", although Cher received more attention as a performer.<ref name=pc44/> He played a major part in Cher's solo recording career, writing and producing singles including \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)|Bang Bang]]\" and \"[[You Better Sit Down Kids]]\".\n\nBono co-wrote \"[[She Said Yeah]]\", covered by [[The Rolling Stones]] on their 1965 LP ''[[December's Children (And Everybody's)|December's Children]]''. His lone hit single as a solo artist, \"[[Laugh at Me]]\", was released in 1965 and peaked at No. 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. In live concerts, Bono introduced the song by saying \"I'd like to sing a medley of my hit\".

In the 1975 TV movie ''[[Murder on Flight 502]]'', he played the role of rock star Jack Marshall. He appeared in the 1980 miniseries ''Top of the Hill''. He played the role of mad bomber Joe Selucci in ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and appeared in the horror film ''[[Troll (film)|Troll]]'' (1986). He also portrayed racist entrepreneur Franklin von Tussle in the [[John Waters]] film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988). In ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997), Bono is one of several oddball celebrities seen on a wall of video screens that monitor extraterrestrials living among us. He also appeared as the Mayor of Palm Springs (which he actually was at the time) in several episodes of ''[[P.S. I Luv U]]'' during the 1991\u201392 TV season, and on ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (in Season 1, Episode 9, which aired November 21, 1993), in which he played Mayor Frank Berkowitz. He also made a minor appearance as himself in the comedy film ''[[First Kid]]'' (1996).\n\nBono guest-starred as himself on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' episode \"Mrs. George Devereaux\" (originally broadcast November 17, 1990), in which he vied with [[Lyle Waggoner]] for Dorothy's ([[Bea Arthur]]) affection in a dream sequence. In Blanche's ([[Rue McClanahan]]) dream, her husband is still alive, and Bono uses his power as Mayor of Palm Springs to have Waggoner falsely arrested so he can have Dorothy to himself.\n\n===Political career===\n{{See also|Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act}}\nBono entered politics after experiencing great frustration with local government bureaucracy in trying to open a restaurant in [[Palm Springs, California]]. Bono placed a successful bid to become the new mayor of Palm Springs.

In 1998, then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]] made a public appearance and speech at the shore of the lake on Bono's behalf.\n\nIn their book ''Tell Newt to Shut Up'', [[David Maraniss]] and [[Michael Weisskopf]] credit Bono with being the first person to recognize Gingrich's public relations problems in 1995. Drawing on his long experience as a celebrity and entertainment producer, Bono (according to Maraniss and Weisskopf) recognized that Gingrich's status had changed from politician to celebrity and that he was not making allowances for that change:\n\n{{blockquote|You're a celebrity now, ...

This is the idea that all languages conform to the same structural principles, which define the space of possible languages.\n\nBoth poverty of the stimulus and universal grammar are terms that can be credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. Chomsky coined the term \"poverty of the stimulus\" in 1980, however he had argued for the idea since his [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|1959 review of B.F. Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'']].

This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls \"[[Plato's Problem]]\". He outlined this [[philosophical]] approach in the first chapter of the ''Knowledge of Language'' in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I6CZ6wpNKeEC&pg=PA42&dq=plato's+problem#v=onepage&q=plato's%20problem&f=true|title=The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky|author=James McGilvray|date=2005-02-24|page=42|accessdate=2016-01-21|via=Books.google.com|isbn=9780521784313}}</ref> Plato's Problem traces back to ''[[Meno]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]].

Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures.\n\nLinguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience.

Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nAn overarching theme in examples provided as evidence for the poverty of the stimulus is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)</nowiki>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n==== Learning stress systems ====\nBergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85\u201396}}</ref> The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Rejection by the scientific community==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus had been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald_Marchman_2006>{{cite book |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne| last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |editor-last= Traxler and Gernsbacher |title= Handbook of Psycholinguistics |publisher=Routledge |date=2006 |pages=1027\u20141071 |chapter= 27: Language learning in infancy |isbn= 9780080466415}}</ref> This led to the rejection of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref> According to some professionals, five decades of research were wasted between 1964 and 2014 due to Chomsky's influence;

This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls \"[[Plato's Problem]]\". He outlined this [[philosophical]] approach in the first chapter of the ''Knowledge of Language'' in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I6CZ6wpNKeEC&pg=PA42&dq=plato's+problem#v=onepage&q=plato's%20problem&f=true|title=The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky|author=James McGilvray|date=2005-02-24|page=42|accessdate=2016-01-21|via=Books.google.com|isbn=9780521784313}}</ref> Plato's Problem traces back to ''[[Meno]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]].

Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures.\n\nLinguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience.

And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)</nowiki>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n==== Learning stress systems ====\nBergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85\u201396}}</ref> The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Rejection by the scientific community==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus had been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald_Marchman_2006>{{cite book |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne| last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |editor-last= Traxler and Gernsbacher |title= Handbook of Psycholinguistics |publisher=Routledge |date=2006 |pages=1027\u20141071 |chapter= 27: Language learning in infancy |isbn= 9780080466415}}</ref> This led to the rejection of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref> According to some professionals, 50 years of research was wasted between 1964 and 2014 due to Chomsky's influence;
