For the next 25K, the lead pack remained about the same size with some runners bridging the gap in time for others to fall off the pace.  Between 25K and 30K, the pack dropped to a dozen runners.  Just after 31K, defending champion [[Edna Kiplagat]] accelerated.  In the next 4K, the lead pack cut in half, the remaining athletes were three Kenyans, two Ethiopians and [[Eunice Kirwa]] wearing a Bahrain uniform, from Kenya.  London Marathon champion [[Tigist Tufa]] was the first to fall back, then Kiplagat began to lose contact.  But the four person pack remained tougher into the stadium.  Four athletes to sprint it out on the track for three medals after running 26 miles.  [[Mare Dibaba]] (no relation to the other famous Dibaba sisters) led the group toward the tunnel.  As they started to speed up, [[Jemima Sumgong]] did not have another gear.  Kirwa was perfectly positioned to strike but instead [[Helah Kiprop]] launched the attack from the back after looking like she was ready to drop off, long striding behind the diminutive Dibaba.  60 metres before the finish they were almost even, but Dibaba would not give that last few inches.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iaaf.org/news/report/beijing-2015-women-marathon|title=REPORT: WOMEN\u2019S MARATHON \u2013 IAAF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, BEIJING 2015|date=30 August 2015|work=iaaf.org|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\t\nThen Dibaba sped away to cross the line with almost 7 metres gap.  The times had a second between first and second, a four-second gap amongst the medalists and a 7-second gap back to fourth place.

skies <!-- (is that overcast in Beijing?) --> the race quickly formed two large packs of about 20 runners.  For the next 25K, the lead pack remained about the same size with some runners bridging the gap in time for others to fall off the pace.  Between 25K and 30K, the pack dropped to a dozen runners.  Just after 31K, defending champion [[Edna Kiplagat]] accelerated.  In the next 4K, the lead pack cut in half, the remaining athletes were three Kenyans, two Ethiopians and [[Eunice Kirwa]] wearing a Bahrain uniform, from Kenya.  London Marathon champion [[Tigist Tufa]] was the first to fall back, then Kiplagat began to lose contact.  But the four person pack remained tougher into the stadium.  Four athletes to sprint it out on the track for three medals after running 26 miles.  [[Mare Dibaba]] (no relation to the other famous Dibaba sisters) led the group toward the tunnel.  As they started to speed up, [[Jemima Sumgong]] did not have another gear.  Kirwa was perfectly positioned to strike but instead [[Helah Kiprop]] launched the attack from the back after looking like she was ready to drop off, long striding behind the diminutive Dibaba.  60 metres before the finish they were almost even, but Dibaba would not give that last few inches.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iaaf.org/news/report/beijing-2015-women-marathon|title=REPORT: WOMEN\u2019S MARATHON \u2013 IAAF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, BEIJING 2015|date=30 August 2015|work=iaaf.org|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\t\nThen Dibaba sped away to cross the line with almost 7 metres gap.  The times had a second between first and second, a four-second gap amongst the medalists and a 7-second gap back to fourth place.

The 75th Precinct had one of the highest murder rates in the country during the late 1980s. Dowd describes being under-appreciated for the amount of work he put in and hurting for money as the reasons for taking money from drug dealers. He initially began taking bribes from drug dealers on the streets before moving on to protecting a drug cartel leader and robbing other drug dealers at gunpoint. Dowd and his then-partner Henry \"Chicky\" Guevara recount the first time walking into a domestic dispute in an apartment and seeing bags of marijuana, a [[duffle bag]] filled with approximately $20,000 in cash and two guns. Dowd communicated that he and his partner would take $8000 from the duffle bag and both guns. Dowd continued to rob drug dealers for thousands of dollars.  Guevara resigned shortly after multiple police officers were arrested in the 77th Precinct for corruption related offenses.\n\nKen Eurell, a police officer at the 75th Precinct, was then assigned as Dowd's new partner in June 1987. Eurell had a drinking problem and frequently drank on the job. Dowd and Eurell met a Dominican gang leader named Adam Diaz. Diaz ran The Diaz Organization, a gang that was responsible for countless murders and drug trafficking throughout New York City. He used several supermarkets in East New York as fronts to traffic drugs, mainly cocaine. Dowd and Eurell began a working relationship with Diaz, where they provided protection and inside information about raids.\n\nAfter a prolonged investigation, the [[Suffolk County Police Department]] arrested Dowd and Eurell on [[drug trafficking]] charges (in addition to their work for Diaz in the city, the men had begun distributing cocaine through a friend who lived in the county). Dowd and Eurell were released on bail. While out on bail, Dowd was approached by a friend in a Colombian gang who wanted a woman kidnapped over an unpaid drug debt. Dowd's plan was to hand the woman over to the gang and for him and Eurell to take the hundreds of thousands of dollars at the woman's house and flee the United States. Eurell agreed to Dowd's kidnapping scheme but instead of following through with the scheme contacted [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] through his lawyer. Shortly after, in July 1991, Dowd was arrested and sent to trial. He was the main focus of the 1992 Mollen Commission that investigated police corruption in the [[NYPD]].<ref name=\"dowd\">{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.themikedowd.com/what-we-do/|website=The Mike Dowd|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref> In the wake of Dowd's arrest, Mayor [[David Dinkins]] appointed the Mollen Commission to investigate police corruption within the [[NYPD]].

He will attack anyone who crosses his land, believing their intention is to fight him, and although his past is not delved into it is implied he had retreated to this stretch of land after being continuously victimized by others. The story began with [[He-Man]] crossing his land, and despite stating his [[peace]], Ram-Man disbelieves him and attacks him. Left with no choice but to fight Ram-Man, He-Man fights back and quickly beats him.\n\n[[Humiliation|Humiliated]] by this defeat, Ram-Man swears to get revenge on He-Man, and his [[confusion]] is taken advantage of by [[Skeletor]], who was [[spy]]ing on the fight. Skeletor tricks Ram-Man into believing He-Man is [[evil]], and leads him to [[Castle Grayskull]], where he forces Ram-Man into ramming the jaw bridge repeatedly to gain entry to the castle, where Ram-Man believes He-Man is. When [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|The Sorceress]] witnesses Skeletor's attempt to break into Grayskull, she calls He-Man to her aid, who releases Ram-Man from Skeletor's clutches and drives away the villain. Realizing he had been tricked and that He-Man means him no harm, Ram-Man befriends He-Man and joins the Heroic Warriors.\n\nAs with several early characters, Ram-Man's mini-comic appearances decreased as new characters were showcased.\n\n==1980s Filmation cartoon==\nAlthough large and aggressive in his mini-comic appearance, the 1980s cartoon ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' by [[Filmation]] depicts him as a small, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]ish figure, which is actually closer in appearance to his action figure.\n\nIn order to make the character more [[child]]-friendly for the sake of the show's intended audience, Ram-Man's aggressiveness is toned down for the series. He is portrayed generally as a [[comedy|comical]] character, slow and dim-witted with an almost childlike mentality, but also strong-hearted and easily likeable. He often appears alongside [[Stratos (Masters of the Universe)|Stratos]] in early episodes, and later episodes flesh out his character more, particularly the season 2 episode \"Not So Blind\", which shows a degree of humanity in his mostly [[slapstick]] personality. Another notable moment for Ram-Man is the episode \"House of Shokoti part 1\", in which he gives a memorable moral at the end of the episode, telling kids not to hit things with their head like he does in case they hurt themselves. Also in this episode, Ram-Man irritates Shokoti by constantly mispronouncing her name, calling her \"Shipoopi\" among other things. This Ram-Man also often has other cartoonish features such as his legs actually uncoiling like springs on occasion and making \"boing\" sounds when he used his abilities.\n\nUnlike other early characters, such as [[Stratos (Masters of the Universe)|Stratos]] and Evil Warriors such as [[Tri-Klops]], who faded into the background as newer characters were introduced in the cartoon, Ram-Man continued to appear regularly in later episodes of the cartoon.\n\n==2002 series==\nRam-Man features in the modern revival of Masters of the Universe, and his portrayal in the contemporary series is something of a mixture between his Filmation portrayal and his original mini-comic portrayal. Here he is once again drawn as a large and bulky rather than a dwarfish character, and is actually larger than even He-Man in size. In episodes were he removes his helmet, he appears to have a metal plate on top of his head with a military flat-top hair cut. Although this series depicts him in a more [[macho]] fashion more in-keeping with the original concept of the character, his slow-wittedness and comic appeal is left intact. There is still a childlike dimension to his character, made most evident in the episode \"Night of the Shadow Beasts\", which reveals he is afraid of the dark. Perhaps his most significant episode of the modern-day series is \"Siren's Song\", in which he falls under a mesmerising spell by [[Evil-Lyn]], which results in him coming under suspicion of being a [[traitor]] to the Masters. Unaware of the [[crime]] he has committed under a [[altered state of consciousness|trance state]], Ram-Man is shown as excitable and overly-defensive as the Masters try to identify the traitor in their ranks.\n\nOne big difference from the Filmation series is that, in the 2002 series, Ram-Man doesn't have springy legs that make him bounce, so he just walks and runs like a normal person.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn 2011, [[BBC Online]] reported that performer Jamie Moakes was trying to create \"a new commodity, one to replace gold, silver and copper\", by buying as many Ram-Man figures as possible.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16207626 | work=BBC News | title=Ram Man collector Jamie Moakes hopes for gold prices | date=2011-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRam-Man was voted No.9 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by [[Io9]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite news|title = The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys |work= [[Io9]]|date=|url= http://io9.com/5508866/the-10-most-unfortunate-masters-of-the-universe-toys|accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref> Ram-Man was voted No.12 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by [[Topless Robot]].<ref name=\"toplessrobot.com\">{{cite news|title= The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features|publisher= [[Topless Robot]]|date=|url= http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/the_12_coolest_masters_of_the_universe_action_feat.php|accessdate=2014-09-05}}</ref> Ram-Man was voted by Mania.com as the fourth most Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures.<ref name=\"mania.com\">{{cite news|title= 8 Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures|work=Mania.com|date=|url= http://www.mania.com/8-crazy-masters-universe-figures_article_117840.html|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> [[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] voted Ram-Man 14th worst He-Man toy.<ref name=\"cbr.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/the-worst-he-man-toys-ever/|title=He-Man: The 15 Worst Toys Ever|date=3 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Masters of the Universe}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Masters of the Universe Heroic Warriors]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Ramman}}\n{{Infobox character\n| color            = #DEDEE2\n| name             = Ram-Man\n| series           = [[Masters of the Universe]]\n| creator          = [[Mattel]]\n| voice            = [[John Erwin]]<br>(1983)<br>[[Scott Mcneil]]<br>(2003)\n| gender           = Male\n}}\n\n'''Ram-Man''' is a [[fictional character]] from the popular [[Masters of the Universe]] [[toy]] line by [[Mattel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32989/he-man-and-the-masters-of-the-universe-volume-one/\n|title= He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Season One, Volume One|accessdate=2009-04-04 |work= [[DVD Talk]] |publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the Heroic Warriors, characterized by his bulky, spring-legged, stumpy appearance and flat-topped [[metal]] [[helmet]].

Unaware of the [[crime]] he has committed under a [[altered state of consciousness|trance state]], Ram-Man is shown as excitable and overly-defensive as the Masters try to identify the traitor in their ranks.\n\nOne big difference from the Filmation series is that, in the 2002 series, Ram-Man doesn't have springy legs that make him bounce, so he just walks and runs like a normal person.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn 2011, [[BBC Online]] reported that performer Jamie Moakes was trying to create \"a new commodity, one to replace gold, silver and copper\", by buying as many Ram-Man figures as possible.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16207626 | work=BBC News | title=Ram Man collector Jamie Moakes hopes for gold prices | date=2011-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRam-Man was voted No.9 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by [[Io9]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite news|title = The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys |work= [[Io9]]|date=|url= http://io9.com/5508866/the-10-most-unfortunate-masters-of-the-universe-toys|accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref> Ram-Man was voted No.12 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by [[Topless Robot]].<ref name=\"toplessrobot.com\">{{cite news|title= The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features|publisher= [[Topless Robot]]|date=|url= http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/the_12_coolest_masters_of_the_universe_action_feat.php|accessdate=2014-09-05}}</ref> Ram-Man was voted by Mania.com as the fourth most Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures.<ref name=\"mania.com\">{{cite news|title= 8 Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures|work=Mania.com|date=|url= http://www.mania.com/8-crazy-masters-universe-figures_article_117840.html|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> [[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] voted Ram-Man 14th worst He-Man toy.<ref name=\"cbr.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/the-worst-he-man-toys-ever/|title=He-Man: The 15 Worst Toys Ever|date=3 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Masters of the Universe}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Masters of the Universe Heroic Warriors]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: child-like \u2192 childlike (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram-Man"}

At first, only $13 million was donated from private sectors but the project gained momentum as the years went on.\nBeginning in 1996, the Library of Congress sponsored a three-year competition with a $2 million gift from the Ameritech Corporation to enable public research, and academic libraries, museums, historical societies, and archival institutions (with the exception of federal institutions) to digitize American history collections and make them available on the Library's American Memory site. The competition produced 23 digital collections that complement American Memory, which now features more than 100 thematic collections.\n\n==Beginnings==\nThe American Memory project started as a two-part effort of the National Digital Library Project (NDLP). Starting in 1994, the goal of the NDLP to digitize millions of items by the year 2000 would not only be met but would even go beyond that when the year finally came. The first part or phase of the effort was piloted by the American Memory project which would have an extensive amount of the Library of Congress\u2019 source-materials digitized. Another segment of the first phase possessed the goal of establishing a way or model to somehow share or distribute such source-materials between libraries.

The scope of the various items held in this digital library is massive.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\nAs a result of the three-year competition and all the new individual projects making American Memory more readily available, American Memory started to become recognized on a larger scale. In 1996, Time Magazine named American Memory one of the top ten best websites in the United States.
