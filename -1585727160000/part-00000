He studied at [[Trinity College Dublin]] (MusB 1915, MusD 1917), also at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM) with [[Michele Esposito]]. Larchet was music director at the [[Abbey Theatre]] from 1908 to 1935 and was therefore responsible for the stage music accompanying many of the pivotal plays of the [[Irish Literary Renaissance]], in particular those of [[William Butler Yeats]], and also had his ballet ''Bluebeard'' performed there (in 1932), including the dancer [[Ninette de Valois]]. Although a prolific composer and arranger, his main contribution to Irish music was as a teacher: He taught harmony and counterpoint at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] between 1920 and 1955<ref>Axel Klein: ''Irish Classical Recordings: A Discography of Irish Art Music'' (Westport, CT, 2001), p. 100: \"John F. Larchet (* Dublin 1884, t Dublin 1967). John Francis Larchet built the bridge between the 19th and the 20th century in Irish music. [...] However, Larchet is best remembered for his teaching.\"</ref> and was Professor of Music at [[University College Dublin]] between 1921 and 1958. Among his pupils were [[Frank Ll. Harrison]] (1905\u20131987), [[Michael Bowles]] (1909\u20131998), [[Frederick May (composer)|Frederick May]] (1911\u20131985), [[Walter Beckett (composer)|Walter Beckett]] (1914\u20131996), [[Joan Trimble]] (1915\u20132000), [[Brian Boydell]] (1917\u20132000), [[T.C. Kelly]] (1917\u20131985), [[Havelock Nelson]] (1917\u20131996), [[Gerard Victory]] (1921\u20131995), and [[Se\u00f3irse Bodley]] (b. 1933).<ref>Axel Klein: ''Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert'' (Hildesheim, 1996), p. 429\u201330</ref>\n\nLarchet was primarily a composer of miniatures and an arranger of Irish folksongs for classical ensembles. His arrangement (in 1954) of the Irish national anthem is the official version still in use{{by whom?|date=February 2019}} today.<ref>\u00dana-Frances Clarke: \"Larchet, John Francis\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin, 2013), vol. 1, p. 579\u201380)</ref>\n\nHis daughter, Sheila Larchet Cuthbert (b. 1923), is an Irish harpist and author.<ref>Nora Joan Clark: ''The Story of the Irish Harp: Its History and Influence'' (Lynnwood, WA: North Creek Press, 2003), p. 126: \"Sheila's father, Dr. John F.

He studied at [[Trinity College Dublin]] (MusB 1915, MusD 1917), also at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM) with [[Michele Esposito]]. Larchet was music director at the [[Abbey Theatre]] from 1908 to 1935 and was therefore responsible for the stage music accompanying many of the pivotal plays of the [[Irish Literary Renaissance]], in particular those of [[William Butler Yeats]], and also had his ballet ''Bluebeard'' performed there (in 1932), including the dancer [[Ninette de Valois]]. Although a prolific composer and arranger, his main contribution to Irish music was as a teacher: He taught harmony and counterpoint at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] between 1920 and 1955<ref>Axel Klein: ''Irish Classical Recordings: A Discography of Irish Art Music'' (Westport, CT, 2001), p. 100: \"John F.

[...] However, Larchet is best remembered for his teaching.\"</ref> and was Professor of Music at [[University College Dublin]] between 1921 and 1958. Among his pupils were [[Frank Ll. Harrison]] (1905\u20131987), [[Michael Bowles]] (1909\u20131998), [[Frederick May (composer)|Frederick May]] (1911\u20131985), [[Walter Beckett (composer)|Walter Beckett]] (1914\u20131996), [[Joan Trimble]] (1915\u20132000), [[Brian Boydell]] (1917\u20132000), [[T.C. Kelly]] (1917\u20131985), [[Havelock Nelson]] (1917\u20131996), [[Gerard Victory]] (1921\u20131995), and [[Se\u00f3irse Bodley]] (b. 1933).<ref>Axel Klein: ''Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert'' (Hildesheim, 1996), p. 429\u201330</ref>\n\nLarchet was primarily a composer of miniatures and an arranger of Irish folksongs for classical ensembles.

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies''' ('''SAIS''') is a division of [[Johns Hopkins University]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, with campuses in [[Bologna]], Italy, and [[Nanjing]], China. It is considered one of the top [[graduate schools]] for [[international relations]] in the world.{{According to whom|date=April 2020}} The institution is devoted to the study of [[international relations|international affairs]], [[economics]], [[diplomacy]], and [[policy]] research and education.<ref name=\"irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu/|title=Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations &#124; Home|website=irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmong the political scientists and economists based here are former [[World Bank]] Chief Economist [[Anne Osborn Krueger|Anne Krueger]]; and military historian and former [[Counselor of the United States Department of State]] [[Eliot Cohen]].

The school has hosted world leaders on a regular basis for public debate in international affairs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) was founded in 1943 by [[Paul H. Nitze]] and [[Christian Herter]] as a standalone graduate school and became part of [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in 1950. The school was established during World War II by a group of statesmen who sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the postwar world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist.<ref name=\"Johns Hopkins Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=https://pages.jh.edu/jhumag/0400web/26.html|title=Pioneers of Advocacy: Not Just a Cold Warrior|last=Cavanaugh Simpson|first=Joanne|magazine=Johns Hopkins Magazine|location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=April 2000|language=en-US|oclc=644322652|access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe founders assembled a faculty of scholars and professionals (often borrowed from other universities) to teach international relations, international economics, and foreign languages to a small group of students. The curriculum was designed to be both scholarly and practical. The natural choice for the location of the school was Washington, D.C., a city where international resources are abundant and where [[American foreign policy]] is shaped and set in motion. When the school opened in 1944, 15 students were enrolled.<ref>Gutner, Tammi L. ''The Story of SAIS''. Washington, D.C.: School of Advanced International Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the school created the [[Bologna Center]] in Italy, the first full-time graduate school located in Europe under an American higher-education system. By 1963 Johns Hopkins SAIS outgrew its first quarters on Florida Avenue and moved to one of its present buildings on Massachusetts Avenue. In 1986, the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]] was created in [[Nanjing]], China, completing the school's global presence. In January 2019, Johns Hopkins University announced that it had purchased the [[Newseum]] building on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW and will remodel the building to house SAIS and other Washington, D.C.-based programs.<ref>https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/newseum-to-move-as-johns-hopkins-announces-building-purchase/692/</ref> \n\nThe school is a member of the [[Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs]] (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Organization and academic programs ==\n[[File:Johns Hopkins University DC campus.JPG|thumb|200px|Campus building on Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.]]\nJohns Hopkins SAIS is a global school with campuses on three continents. It has nearly 700 full-time students in Washington, D.C.; 190 full-time students in [[Bologna]], Italy; and about 160 full-time students in [[Nanjing]], China. Of these, 60 percent come from the United States and 37 percent from more than 70 other countries.<ref>[http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pressroom/publications/brochure/sais-brochure-2009.pdf SAIS Prepare to Lead Brochure, released Summer 2009]</ref> Around 50% are women and 22% are from U.S. minority groups. SAIS Europe is home to the [[Bologna Center]] and the only full-time [[international relations]] graduate program in Europe that operates under an American higher-education system, and the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]], which teaches courses in both [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and English, is jointly administered by Johns Hopkins SAIS and [[Nanjing University]].<ref>See Norton Wheeler, ''Role of American NGOs in China's Modernization: Invited Influence'' (Routledge, 2014)  [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=43437 online review], on the history of the Nanjing Center</ref>\n\nThe school offers multidisciplinary instruction leading to the degrees of [[master of arts]] for early and mid-career professionals, as well as a [[doctor of philosophy]] program. Approximately 300 students graduate from the Washington, D.C., campus each year from the two-year master of arts program in international relations and international economics. Unlike most other international affairs graduate schools that offer professional master's degrees, Johns Hopkins SAIS requires its master of arts candidates to be proficient in another language outside their mother tongue <ref>https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-degrees/master-arts-ma</ref> and fulfill the International Ecopass, a one-hour capstone oral examination synthesizing and integrating knowledge from the student's regional or functional concentration and international economics.<ref name='SAIS01'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/academics/degrees/ma/requirements.htm|title=Johns Hopkins SAIS Academics &#124; MA Program &#124; Requirements|website=www.sais-jhu.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The oral examination and international economics requirements of the master of arts curriculum have been the signature aspects of the school's education.\n\n== Reputation ==\nA study conducted in 2005 examined graduate international relations programs throughout the United States, interviewing over a thousand professionals in the field, with the results subsequently published in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine as \"[[Inside the Ivory Tower#2005 rankings|Inside the Ivory Tower]]\" rankings. 65 percent of respondents named Johns Hopkins University\u2013SAIS as the best terminal master's program in international relations. SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University's [[School of Foreign Service]], Harvard University's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], Tufts University's [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], and the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|School of International and Public Affairs]] at Columbia University. The latest edition of the study was produced in 2014, with the master's program at SAIS ranking second globally after the School of Foreign Service.\n\nSince 1990, SAIS and the Fletcher School have been the only non-law schools in the United States to participate in the [[Philip Jessup|Philip C. Jessup]] International Law Moot Court Competition. Competing against full-time law students, SAIS generalists have performed very well. SAIS has twice placed second overall out of 12 schools and advanced to the \"final four\" in its region. In head-to-head competitions, SAIS has defeated schools such as [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]].\n\nSAIS students have successfully competed in the Sustainable Innovation Summit Challenge hosted by Arizona State University's [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]].

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies''' ('''SAIS''') is a division of [[Johns Hopkins University]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, with campuses in [[Bologna]], Italy, and [[Nanjing]], China. It is considered one of the top [[graduate schools]] for [[international relations]] in the world.{{According to whom|date=April 2020}} The institution is devoted to the study of [[international relations|international affairs]], [[economics]], [[diplomacy]], and [[policy]] research and education.<ref name=\"irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu/|title=Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations &#124; Home|website=irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmong the political scientists and economists based here are former [[World Bank]] Chief Economist [[Anne Osborn Krueger|Anne Krueger]]; and military historian and former [[Counselor of the United States Department of State]] [[Eliot Cohen]]. Its students are selected from a large pool of applicants from all parts of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/career-services#employers|title=SAIS Office of Career Services &#124; For Employers|website=www.sais-jhu.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe SAIS Washington D.C. campus is located on [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] NW's [[Embassy Row]], just off [[Dupont Circle]] and across from the [[Brookings Institution]] and the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and next to the [[Center for Global Development]] and the [[Peterson Institute]]. The school has hosted world leaders on a regular basis for public debate in international affairs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) was founded in 1943 by [[Paul H. Nitze]] and [[Christian Herter]] as a standalone graduate school and became part of [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in 1950. The school was established during World War II by a group of statesmen who sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the postwar world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist.<ref name=\"Johns Hopkins Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=https://pages.jh.edu/jhumag/0400web/26.html|title=Pioneers of Advocacy: Not Just a Cold Warrior|last=Cavanaugh Simpson|first=Joanne|magazine=Johns Hopkins Magazine|location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=April 2000|language=en-US|oclc=644322652|access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe founders assembled a faculty of scholars and professionals (often borrowed from other universities) to teach international relations, international economics, and foreign languages to a small group of students. The curriculum was designed to be both scholarly and practical. The natural choice for the location of the school was Washington, D.C., a city where international resources are abundant and where [[American foreign policy]] is shaped and set in motion. When the school opened in 1944, 15 students were enrolled.<ref>Gutner, Tammi L. ''The Story of SAIS''. Washington, D.C.: School of Advanced International Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the school created the [[Bologna Center]] in Italy, the first full-time graduate school located in Europe under an American higher-education system. By 1963 Johns Hopkins SAIS outgrew its first quarters on Florida Avenue and moved to one of its present buildings on Massachusetts Avenue. In 1986, the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]] was created in [[Nanjing]], China, completing the school's global presence. In January 2019, Johns Hopkins University announced that it had purchased the [[Newseum]] building on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW and will remodel the building to house SAIS and other Washington, D.C.-based programs.<ref>https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/newseum-to-move-as-johns-hopkins-announces-building-purchase/692/</ref> \n\nThe school is a member of the [[Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs]] (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Organization and academic programs ==\n[[File:Johns Hopkins University DC campus.JPG|thumb|200px|Campus building on Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.]]\nJohns Hopkins SAIS is a global school with campuses on three continents. It has nearly 700 full-time students in Washington, D.C.; 190 full-time students in [[Bologna]], Italy; and about 160 full-time students in [[Nanjing]], China. Of these, 60 percent come from the United States and 37 percent from more than 70 other countries.<ref>[http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pressroom/publications/brochure/sais-brochure-2009.pdf SAIS Prepare to Lead Brochure, released Summer 2009]</ref> Around 50% are women and 22% are from U.S. minority groups. SAIS Europe is home to the [[Bologna Center]] and the only full-time [[international relations]] graduate program in Europe that operates under an American higher-education system, and the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]], which teaches courses in both [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and English, is jointly administered by Johns Hopkins SAIS and [[Nanjing University]].<ref>See Norton Wheeler, ''Role of American NGOs in China's Modernization: Invited Influence'' (Routledge, 2014)  [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=43437 online review], on the history of the Nanjing Center</ref>\n\nThe school offers multidisciplinary instruction leading to the degrees of [[master of arts]] for early and mid-career professionals, as well as a [[doctor of philosophy]] program. Approximately 300 students graduate from the Washington, D.C., campus each year from the two-year master of arts program in international relations and international economics. Unlike most other international affairs graduate schools that offer professional master's degrees, Johns Hopkins SAIS requires its master of arts candidates to be proficient in another language outside their mother tongue <ref>https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-degrees/master-arts-ma</ref> and fulfill the International Ecopass, a one-hour capstone oral examination synthesizing and integrating knowledge from the student's regional or functional concentration and international economics.<ref name='SAIS01'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/academics/degrees/ma/requirements.htm|title=Johns Hopkins SAIS Academics &#124; MA Program &#124; Requirements|website=www.sais-jhu.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The oral examination and international economics requirements of the master of arts curriculum have been the signature aspects of the school's education.\n\n== Reputation ==\nA study conducted in 2005 examined graduate international relations programs throughout the United States, interviewing over a thousand professionals in the field, with the results subsequently published in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine as \"[[Inside the Ivory Tower#2005 rankings|Inside the Ivory Tower]]\" rankings. 65 percent of respondents named Johns Hopkins University\u2013SAIS as the best terminal master's program in international relations. SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University's [[School of Foreign Service]], Harvard University's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], Tufts University's [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], and the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|School of International and Public Affairs]] at Columbia University. The latest edition of the study was produced in 2014, with the master's program at SAIS ranking second globally after the School of Foreign Service.\n\nSince 1990, SAIS and the Fletcher School have been the only non-law schools in the United States to participate in the [[Philip Jessup|Philip C. Jessup]] International Law Moot Court Competition. Competing against full-time law students, SAIS generalists have performed very well. SAIS has twice placed second overall out of 12 schools and advanced to the \"final four\" in its region. In head-to-head competitions, SAIS has defeated schools such as [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]].\n\nSAIS students have successfully competed in the Sustainable Innovation Summit Challenge hosted by Arizona State University's [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]]. Two different SAIS teams won first place in both 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press/press_release/17057-Thunderbird-Names-Sustainable-Innovation-Summit-Winners |title=Thunderbird Names Sustainable Innovation Summit Winners \u2013 Press Releases on|website=csrwire.com|date=2007-11-13|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thunderbird.edu/about_thunderbird/news/more_news_info/2008/_summit_winners_111708.htm|title=Sustainable Innovation Summit winners announced \u2013 Thunderbird School of Global Management|website=www.thunderbird.edu|date=|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nA joint team from SAIS and the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] received second place in the first \"Global Challenge\" competition, a first-of-its-kind competition that challenged teams of MBA and other graduate students to develop a public\u2013private venture to support development and the tourism industry in Asia.

Until recently, the current Horizon Air livery was very similar to that of its parent, Alaska Airlines, except for a dark red (rather than blue) [[Aircraft livery#Cheatline|cheatline]], and the tail includes a stylized sun and sunset logo, rather than an [[Alaskan Native|Eskimo]]. Eleven Q400s are currently painted in special liveries. Some Dash 8-100s and Q200s (no longer in service with Horizon Air) had names of Horizon destinations preceded by \"Great City of\" or \"Great Cities of\" printed on the front of the airplane. The first Dash 8-100, N811PH was dedicated as the \"Great Cities of Seattle/Tacoma\" and the second airplane, N812PH was the \"Great City of Portland\". N824PH was dedicated as the \"Great Cities of Pullman/Moscow\" on one side and the \"Great Cities of Moscow/Pullman\" on the other side. N363PH (Q200) was the first airplane to incorporate the \"deep bing cherry red\" on the underside of the engine nacelle. This became the standard for Horizon's brand livery as well as the current Alaska Airlines livery. Prior to this change, the underside of the nacelle was painted \"Horizon White\".\n\nOn January 25, 2011, Horizon Air announced it was retiring its public brand and adopting the trademark Eskimo of its sister company, Alaska Airlines, on its fleet. Horizon's Bombardier Q400 fleet was repainted with a new scheme prominently featuring \"Alaska\" across the fuselage and the Eskimo on the tail. The planes continue to include a small Horizon logo on the sides of the aircraft, which now appears in Alaska's dark blue color.\n\nOn March 5, 2019, Horizon introduced a themed livery in celebration of Horizon's heritage. Bombardier Q400 #N421QX featured stripes down the side in the traditional Horizon colors and the sunset logo on the tail. The aircraft made its inaugural flight from Yakima to Seattle, the route of Horizon's first ever flight.\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Horizon Air 44539.JPG|thumb|Company headquarters]]\n\n===On-board meals and beverages===\nFlight time permitting, passengers in the main cabin are offered a complimentary small snack (cookie, nuts or a snack mix) and a beverage.\n\nHorizon, like its parent airline Alaska, focuses on offering items produced by companies in the Northwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.komonews.com/seattlerefined/lifestyle/Alaska-Air-Tom-Douglas-and-other-big-names-launch-Alaska-Beyond-297728651.html|title=Alaska Air, Tom Douglas and other big names launch Alaska Beyond|first=Sinclair Broadcast|last=Group|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/flight-experience/beyond.aspx?lid=nav:info-inflight&INT-_AS_NAV_-prodID:InflightExperience#beyond-delicious|title=Introducing Alaska Beyond |publisher=Alaska Airlines}}</ref> Coffee from fellow Seattle company [[Starbucks]] is served on all flights.

Until recently, the current Horizon Air livery was very similar to that of its parent, Alaska Airlines, except for a dark red (rather than blue) [[Aircraft livery#Cheatline|cheatline]], and the tail includes a stylized sun and sunset logo, rather than an [[Alaskan Native|Eskimo]]. Eleven Q400s are currently painted in special liveries. Some Dash 8-100s and Q200s (no longer in service with Horizon Air) had names of Horizon destinations preceded by \"Great City of\" or \"Great Cities of\" printed on the front of the airplane. The first Dash 8-100, N811PH was dedicated as the \"Great Cities of Seattle/Tacoma\" and the second airplane, N812PH was the \"Great City of Portland\". N824PH was dedicated as the \"Great Cities of Pullman/Moscow\" on one side and the \"Great Cities of Moscow/Pullman\" on the other side. N363PH (Q200) was the first airplane to incorporate the \"deep bing cherry red\" on the underside of the engine nacelle. This became the standard for Horizon's brand livery as well as the current Alaska Airlines livery. Prior to this change, the underside of the nacelle was painted \"Horizon White\".\n\nOn January 25, 2011, Horizon Air announced it was retiring its public brand and adopting the trademark Eskimo of its sister company, Alaska Airlines, on its fleet. Horizon's Bombardier Q400 fleet was repainted with a new scheme prominently featuring \"Alaska\" across the fuselage and the Eskimo on the tail. The planes continue to include a small Horizon logo on the sides of the aircraft, which now appears in Alaska's dark blue color.\n\nOn March 5, 2019, Horizon introduced a themed livery in celebration of Horizon's heritage. Bombardier Q400 #N421QX featured stripes down the side in the traditional Horizon colors and the sunset logo on the tail.

An organisation called MILO in2CRICKET, which operates in most areas by volunteers, teaches girls and boys how to play the game of cricket.\n\nMilo's commercials and taglines are \"Go and go and go with Milo\". A recent Australian commercial incorporating this slogan depicts four generations of women on a skipping rope singing \"and my mum gave me Milo to go and go and go.\" The tag \"I need my Milo Today\" is also used. The packaging of tins of Milo in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] are also green and also have people playing sports on the tins, giving it the affectionate name of \"Tak Kiu\", which is Hokkien Chinese for [[football (soccer)|football]]. In [[Colombia]], Milo is closely tied to football, and the slogan several generations have sung is ''Milo te da energ\u00eda, la meta la pones t\u00fa'' (\"Milo gives you the energy, you set the goal\").\n\nMilo is very popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the brand name is synonymous with chocolate flavoured drinks: Milo has a 90% market share in Malaysia (not the often quoted 90% worldwide share of Milo consumption),<ref>[http://www.nestle.com/Resource.axd?Id=9EE4B633-5B80-4CC6-9CF1-F61EFD87A1CA Nestl\u00e9: Our transformational opportunity]</ref> and Malaysians were said to be the world's largest consumers of Milo.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jaya|first=Petaling|title=Shahrir urges restaurants to lower price of Milo|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx?file=%2f2009%2f2%2f24%2fnation%2f3333128&sec=nation%3a|accessdate=15 August 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=24 February 2009}}</ref> This is because Milo was once used as a nutrient supplement when it was first introduced in the country, and has thus gained a reputation as a 'must have' drink for the old and the younger generations. Milo manufactured in [[Malaysia]] is made to dissolve well in hot water to produce a smooth hot chocolate drink, or with ice added for a cold drink. \"Milo Vans\" were often associated with sports days in these two countries, during which primary school pupils would queue up to collect their cups of Milo drinks using [[coupons]].\n\nIn Peru, during the 1970s [[Juan Velasco Alvarado|military dictatorship]], Milo labels displayed Peruvian motifs, such as photos and pictures of Peruvian towns, history, crops, fruits, animals, plants,<ref>{{cite web|author=Arkivperu |url=http://www.arkivperu.com/blog/?p=337 |title=\"Zoolog\u00eda bot\u00e1nica\" de Milo (1973) &#124; |publisher=Arkivperu.com |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkivperu.com/zoologia-botanica-de-milo-1976/|title=\"Zoolog\u00eda bot\u00e1nica\" de Milo (1973)|date=2 December 2007|publisher=Arkivperu|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> as an educational aid. After 1980, when the military left power, sports predominated on the labels.\n\nMilo is sold by Nestl\u00e9 in Canada at all major food retailers. Although Milo has been available since the 1970s, a Canadian-specific flavour launched within the last decade{{When|date=December 2019}} that dissolves quicker but maintains the sweet malt flavour profile. It competes with the British brand [[Ovaltine]]. \n\nAside from the International section of specific grocery stores and certain Asian grocery stores, Nestl\u00e9 does not market Milo in the United States. In 2017 the Colombian manufactured Milo has started appearing on shelves in supermarkets in the United States such as [[Walmart]] (Alongside Hispanic sections), and [[King Soopers]] (Denver CO).\n\nIt can also be found in the United Kingdom in some [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Tesco]] supermarkets, which import it from Kenya and South Africa. [[Asian supermarket|Asian food specialists]], such as Mini Siam Oriental Foods and Hoo Hing also stock it. A similar product called [[Ovaltine]] is most popular with UK consumers.\n\nIn Ireland, it can be found in many Asian or African stores. Typically they will stock Kenyan or Filipino Milo.\n\nIn China, it is commonly sold in Western supermarkets, but also smaller convenience stores. Usually packaged in a 240gram flexible foil pouch, single drink packets can also be purchased. The Milo itself contains more milk solids than the Australian Milo{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nIn the past, it was available in Portugal and Brazil. Nestl\u00e9 Brazil discontinued production of Milo in Brazil, to focus on the much-popular domestic brands [[Nescau]] and Nesquik.

A higher malt content form also existed in Australia and was marketed in a brown coloured tin which was usually only available in the 375g size. As of May 2015, this form is no longer manufactured. An organisation called MILO in2CRICKET, which operates in most areas by volunteers, teaches girls and boys how to play the game of cricket.\n\nMilo's commercials and taglines are \"Go and go and go with Milo\". A recent Australian commercial incorporating this slogan depicts four generations of women on a skipping rope singing \"and my mum gave me Milo to go and go and go.\" The tag \"I need my Milo Today\" is also used. The packaging of tins of Milo in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] are also green and also have people playing sports on the tins, giving it the affectionate name of \"Tak Kiu\", which is Hokkien Chinese for [[football (soccer)|football]]. In [[Colombia]], Milo is closely tied to football, and the slogan several generations have sung is ''Milo te da energ\u00eda, la meta la pones t\u00fa'' (\"Milo gives you the energy, you set the goal\").\n\nMilo is very popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the brand name is synonymous with chocolate flavoured drinks: Milo has a 90% market share in Malaysia (not the often quoted 90% worldwide share of Milo consumption),<ref>[http://www.nestle.com/Resource.axd?Id=9EE4B633-5B80-4CC6-9CF1-F61EFD87A1CA Nestl\u00e9: Our transformational opportunity]</ref> and Malaysians were said to be the world's largest consumers of Milo.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jaya|first=Petaling|title=Shahrir urges restaurants to lower price of Milo|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx?file=%2f2009%2f2%2f24%2fnation%2f3333128&sec=nation%3a|accessdate=15 August 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=24 February 2009}}</ref> This is because Milo was once used as a nutrient supplement when it was first introduced in the country, and has thus gained a reputation as a 'must have' drink for the old and the younger generations. Milo manufactured in [[Malaysia]] is made to dissolve well in hot water to produce a smooth hot chocolate drink, or with ice added for a cold drink. \"Milo Vans\" were often associated with sports days in these two countries, during which primary school pupils would queue up to collect their cups of Milo drinks using [[coupons]].\n\nIn Peru, during the 1970s [[Juan Velasco Alvarado|military dictatorship]], Milo labels displayed Peruvian motifs, such as photos and pictures of Peruvian towns, history, crops, fruits, animals, plants,<ref>{{cite web|author=Arkivperu |url=http://www.arkivperu.com/blog/?p=337 |title=\"Zoolog\u00eda bot\u00e1nica\" de Milo (1973) &#124; |publisher=Arkivperu.com |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkivperu.com/zoologia-botanica-de-milo-1976/|title=\"Zoolog\u00eda bot\u00e1nica\" de Milo (1973)|date=2 December 2007|publisher=Arkivperu|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> as an educational aid. After 1980, when the military left power, sports predominated on the labels.\n\nMilo is sold by Nestl\u00e9 in Canada at all major food retailers. Although Milo has been available since the 1970s, a Canadian-specific flavour launched within the last decade{{When|date=December 2019}} that dissolves quicker but maintains the sweet malt flavour profile. It competes with the British brand [[Ovaltine]]. \n\nAside from the International section of specific grocery stores and certain Asian grocery stores, Nestl\u00e9 does not market Milo in the United States. In 2017 the Colombian manufactured Milo has started appearing on shelves in supermarkets in the United States such as [[Walmart]] (Alongside Hispanic sections), and [[King Soopers]] (Denver CO).\n\nIt can also be found in the United Kingdom in some [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Tesco]] supermarkets, which import it from Kenya and South Africa. [[Asian supermarket|Asian food specialists]], such as Mini Siam Oriental Foods and Hoo Hing also stock it. A similar product called [[Ovaltine]] is most popular with UK consumers.\n\nIn Ireland, it can be found in many Asian or African stores. Typically they will stock Kenyan or Filipino Milo.\n\nIn China, it is commonly sold in Western supermarkets, but also smaller convenience stores. Usually packaged in a 240gram flexible foil pouch, single drink packets can also be purchased. The Milo itself contains more milk solids than the Australian Milo{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nIn the past, it was available in Portugal and Brazil. Nestl\u00e9 Brazil discontinued production of Milo in Brazil, to focus on the much-popular domestic brands [[Nescau]] and Nesquik.

Following ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'' (1970) and the less successful [[chamber jazz]]-inspired ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'' (1970), and ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'' (1971), the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation (swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation, reaching a new creative peak on ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' (1973), ''[[Starless and Bible Black]]'' (1974) and ''[[Red (King Crimson album)|Red]]'' (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974.\n\nIn 1981, King Crimson reformed with another change in musical direction and instrumentation (incorporating, for the first time, a mixture of British and American personnel plus doubled guitar and influences taken from [[gamelan]], [[post-punk]] and New York [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]). This lasted for three years, resulting in the trio of albums ''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'' (1981), ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (1982) and ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'' (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as an expanded \"Double Trio\" sextet in 1994, mingling its mid-\u201870s and 1980s approaches with new creative options available via [[MIDI]] technology. This resulted in another three-year cycle of activity including the release of ''[[Thrak]]'' (1995). King Crimson reunited again in 2000 as a more [[alternative metal]]-oriented quartet (or \"Double Duo\"), releasing ''[[The Construkction of Light]]'' in 2000 and ''[[The Power to Believe]]'' in 2003: after further personnel shuffles, the band expanded to a double-drummer quintet for a 2008 tour celebrating their 40th anniversary.\n\nFollowing another hiatus between 2009 and 2012, King Crimson reformed once again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline and the return of saxophone/flute to the lineup for the first time since 1972. This current version of King Crimson has continued to tour and to release live albums, significantly rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire previous career.\n\nSince 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as [[ProjeKcts]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn August 1967, brothers [[Michael Giles]] (drums) and [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), who had been professional musicians in various jobbing bands since their mid-teens in [[Dorset]], England, advertised for a singing organist to join their new group.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000657298|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Giles, Giles and Fripp | accessdate=8 August 2007 | last=Eder|first=Bruce |website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name=\"Voyage-PT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm|title=Interview with Robert Fripp|accessdate=19 August 2007|work=Musician magazine (archived page from elephant-talk.com)|year=1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100954/http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm |archivedate=8 February 2005}}</ref> Fellow Dorset musician [[Robert Fripp]]&nbsp;\u2013 a guitarist who did not sing&nbsp;\u2013 responded and the trio formed the band [[Giles, Giles and Fripp]].

The band's music drew on a wide range of influences provided by all five group members. These elements included romantic- and modernist-era classical music, the psychedelic rock spearheaded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], military music (partially inspired by McDonald's stint as an army musician), ambient improvisation, [[Victoriana]] and British pop.\n\nAfter playing shows across England, the band toured the US with various pop and rock acts. Their first show was at [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]]. While their original sound astounded contemporary audiences and critics,<ref name=AMGBIO /> creative tensions were already developing within the band. Giles and McDonald, still striving to cope with King Crimson's rapid success and the realities of touring life, became uneasy with the band's direction. Although he was neither the dominant composer in the band nor the frontman, Fripp was very much the band's driving force and spokesman, leading King Crimson into progressively darker and more intense musical areas. McDonald and Giles, now favouring a lighter and more romantic style of music, became increasingly uncomfortable with their position and resigned from the band during the US tour. To salvage what he saw as the most important elements of King Crimson, Fripp offered to resign himself, but McDonald and Giles declared that the band was \"more (him) than them\" and that they should therefore be the ones to leave.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> The line-up played their last show at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco on 16 December 1969.<ref name=epitaph /> Live recordings of the tour were released in 1997 on ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]''.\n\n=== 1970\u20131971: the \"interregnum\" \u2013 ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' and ''Lizard'' ===\n\nAfter their first US tour, King Crimson was in a state of flux with various line-up changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction. This period has subsequently been referred to as the \"[[interregnum]]\" \u2013 a nickname implying that the \"King\" (King Crimson) was not properly in place during this time.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Fripp became the only remaining musician in the band, with Sinfield expanding his creative role to playing synthesizers.\n\nFripp and Sinfield recorded the second King Crimson album, ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'', in 1970 with the Giles brothers hired back as the session rhythm section, and with jazz pianist [[Keith Tippett]] and Circus saxophonist [[Mel Collins]] as guest musicians. The group considered hiring [[Elton John]] to be the singer, but decided against the idea.<ref name=\"ETFAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/faq/et-faq.txt|title=King Crimson FAQ|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=Elephant Talk (archived page from elephant-talk.com) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828134638/http://www.elephant-talk.com/faq/et-faq.txt |archivedate=28 August 2005}}</ref> Lake then agreed to sing on the album in exchange for receiving King Crimson's [[public address system|PA equipment]],<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> except on \"Cadence and Cascade\", which is sung by Fripp's friend [[Gordon Haskell]]. Though Tippett was offered band membership, he preferred to remain as a studio collaborator, performing with the band for a single gig.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Upon its release in May 1970, ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album.<ref name=AMGBIO /> With no musicians to perform material from their new album, Fripp and Sinfield persuaded Haskell to join as singer and bassist and recruited [[Andrew McCulloch (drummer)|Andy McCulloch]] as drummer, retaining Collins as saxophonist, flautist and occasional keyboard player.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nDuring the writing sessions for the third album, ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'',<ref name=AMGBIO /> Haskell and McCulloch had no say in the direction of the material, since Fripp and Sinfield wrote the album themselves, bringing in Tippett, [[Mark Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Nick Evans (trombonist)|Nick Evans]] on trombone, and Robin Miller on [[oboe]] and [[cor anglais]] as additional musicians. Haskell sang and played bass. [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was also brought in to sing the first part of the album's title track, \"Prince Rupert Awakes\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell's range and style.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> ''Lizard'' featured stronger avant-garde jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums, as well as Sinfield's upfront experiments with processing and distorting sound through the [[EMS VCS 3]] synthesiser. It also featured complex lyrics from Sinfield, including a coded song about the break-up of [[the Beatles]], with almost the entire second side taken up by a predominantly instrumental chamber suite describing a medieval battle and its outcome. Released in December 1970, ''Lizard'' reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an \"acquired taste\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> ''Lizard'' was certainly not to the taste of the more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch, both of whom found the music difficult to relate to. As a result, Haskell quit the band acrimoniously after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects. McCulloch also departed,<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> leaving Fripp and Sinfield to recruit new members once more.\n\n=== 1971\u20131972: the ''Islands'' band ===\n\nAfter a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] on drums. Auditions for a singer included those from [[Bryan Ferry]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/king-crimson-in-the-wake-of-poseidon/|title=Revisiting King Crimson's Second LP, 'In the Wake of Poseidon'|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and John Gaydon, the band's manager. The position went to [[Boz Burrell|Raymond \"Boz\" Burrell]].<ref name=AMGBIO /> Bassist [[John Wetton]] was invited to join, but declined (at the time) in order to play with [[Family (band)|Family]].<ref name=\"SBHist\">{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/songforme/hist.htm |title=Strange Band \u2013 Family history |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> [[Rick Kemp]] also declined an offer to join,<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> leaving Fripp and Wallace teaching Burrell to play bass rather than continue auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument.<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nIn 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]''. Loosely influenced by [[Miles Davis]]'s orchestral collaborations with [[Gil Evans]] and [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental \"Sailor's Tale\", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). ''Islands'' also featured the band's only experiment with a string ensemble on \"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired \"Ladies of the Road\".

In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the [[Chapman Stick]], a ten-string polyphonic two-handed [[tapping]] guitar instrument that has a bass and treble range and which he played in an \"utterly original style\".<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Why Robert Fripp Resurrected King Crimson|pages=|language=|work=The New York Times |date=November 1981|url=}}</ref> Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a [[Simmons SDS-V]] electronic drum kit. The band's songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew's pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band's previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental (\"The Sheltering Sky\") emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted \"Indiscipline\" was a partially-written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album and to play against the beat in any way that he could.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Released in September 1981, ''Discipline'' reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US.\n\nIn June 1982, King Crimson followed ''Discipline'' with ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (the first King Crimson album recorded with the same band line-up as the album preceding it).<ref name=MM82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=[[Melody Maker]]|date=19 June 1982|url=}}</ref> None of the members of the group produced the record; Davies undertook production duties himself.<ref name=MM82 /> The album had a loosely linked theme of the [[Beat Generation]] and its writings,<ref name=NME82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|pages=|language=|work=New Musical Express |location=UK|date=3 July 1982|url=}}</ref> reflected in song titles such as \"Neal and Jack and Me\" (inspired by [[Neal Cassady]] and [[Jack Kerouac]]), \"The Howler\" (inspired by [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s \"[[Howl]]\") and \"Sartori in Tangier\" (inspired by [[Paul Bowles]]). Fripp asked Belew to read Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]''<ref name=ETFAQ /> for inspiration, and the album contained themes of travel, disorientation and loneliness. While the album was noticeably poppier than ''Discipline'', it featured the harsh, atonal and improvised \"Requiem\".\n\nRecording ''Beat'' was faced with tension with Belew suffering high stress levels over his duties as front man, lead singer, and principal songwriter. On one occasion, he clashed with Fripp and ordered him out of the studio.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /><ref name=brufordautobiography /> After differences were resolved, and while ''Beat'' reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 52 in the US, King Crimson resumed touring.  \"Heartbeat\" was released as a single which peaked at No. 57 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. Around this time the band released the VHS-only '\"The Noise: Live in Frejus\" (DGMVC2), a record of a show played at the Arena, [[Frejus]], France on 27 August 1982. (This video is now on DVD as part of the compilation [[Neal and Jack and Me]].)\n\nKing Crimson's next album, ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'', was recorded in 1983 and released in March 1984. Having encountered difficulty in both writing and determining a direction for the album, the band chose to record and sequence it as a \"left side\" \u2014 four of the band's poppier songs plus an instrumental \u2014 and a \"right side\" (experimental work including extended and atonal improvisations in the tradition of the mid-1970s band, plus as the third part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\"). ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 58 in the US, with \"[[Three of a Perfect Pair (song)|Three of a Perfect Pair]]\" and \"[[Sleepless (King Crimson song)|Sleepless]]\" being released as singles. The 2001 remaster of the album included \"the other side\", a collection of remixes and improvisation out-takes plus Levin's tongue-in-cheek vocal piece, \"The King Crimson Barbershop\". The last concert of the ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' tour, at the [[Spectrum (Montreal)|Spectrum]] in Montreal, Canada on 11 July 1984, was recorded and released in 1998 as ''[[Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal]]''.\n\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"Robert broke up the group, again, for the umpteenth time, dwelling at length, I suppose on our lack of imagination, ability, direction and a thousand other things we were doubtless missing.

Bruford and Belew expressed some frustration over this; Belew recalled the first he had heard of the split was when he read about it in a report in ''Musician'' magazine. Despite these circumstances, the musicians remained on fairly amicable terms. Belew would later refer to the band \"taking a break\" that ultimately lasted for ten years.\n\n=== 1994\u20131999: the Double Trio \u2013 ''Vroooom'', ''THRAK'', and the ProjeKcts ===\nIn the early 1990s, Belew met with Fripp in England with an interest in a reformed King Crimson. Two years later, in 1992, Fripp established the [[Discipline Global Mobile]] (DGM) record label with producer [[David Singleton]]: this would subsequently be the main home for Fripp's work, with main album releases distributed to larger record companies, affording Fripp and his associates greater freedom and more control over their work.\n\nAfter a tour with [[David Sylvian]] in 1993 (who declined an offer to join Crimson), Fripp began to assemble a new version of the band, a union between the band's previous incarnation and the Sylvian & Fripp group: he was joined with Belew, Levin, Bruford, Chapman Stick player [[Trey Gunn]] (a [[Guitar Craft]] alumnus), and drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] (who replaced the first choice, [[Jerry Marotta]]). Fripp explained the six-member formation was to be a \"Double Trio\" with two guitarists, two bassists, and two drummers, to explore a different style of music. Bruford later said he lobbied his own way into the band, believing that King Crimson was very much \"his gig\", and that Fripp had come up with the philosophical explanation later. One of the conditions Fripp had imposed on Bruford regarding his return was to give up all creative control to Fripp.<ref name=brufordautobiography />\n\nFollowing rehearsals in [[Woodstock, New York]], the group released the [[extended play]] ''[[Vrooom]]'' in October 1994. This revealed the new King Crimson sound, which featured elements of the interlocking guitars on ''Discipline'' and the heavy rock feel of ''Red'',<ref name=\"THRAK\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000125655|pure_url=yes}}|title=Thrak|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic|first=Daniel |last=Gioffre}}</ref> but also involved a greater use of ambient electronic sound and ideas from industrial music. In contrast, many of the actual songs \u2013 mostly written or finalised by Belew \u2013 displayed stronger elements of 1960s pop than before \u2013 in particular, a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] influence (although Bruford would also refer to the band as sounding like \"a dissonant [[The Shadows (band)|Shadows]] on steroids\"<ref name=brufordautobiography />).

Instead, the six members (including Bruford) opted to work in four smaller groups (or \"fraKctalisations\", according to Fripp) known as the [[ProjeKcts]]. This enabled the group to continue developing musical ideas and searching for Crimson's next direction without the practical difficulty and expense of convening all six members at once. In 1998 and 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the US, Japan, and the UK and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation.<ref name=RSBIO /> These have been collectively described by music critic [[J.

At the same time, Levin's commitments as a session and touring musician forced him to take an indefinite break from the band. The remaining members (Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto) reconvened as a \"Double Duo\" to write and record ''[[The Construkction of Light]]''<ref name=DGMBIO /> in Belew's basement and garage near [[Nashville]]. Released in May 2000, the album reached No. 129 in the UK. All of the pieces were metallic and harsh in sound, similar to the work of contemporary [[alternative metal]]. They featured a distinct electronic texture, a heavy processed drum sound from Mastelotto, Gunn continuing on Warr Guitar but now taking over the bass role, and a different take on the interlocked guitar sound that the band had used since the 1980s. With the exception of a parodic industrial blues (sung by Belew through a voice changer under the pseudonym of \"Hooter J. Johnson\"), the songs were unrelentingly complex and challenging to the listener, with plenty of rhythmic displacement to add to the harsh textures. The album contains the [[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part IV|fourth instalment]] of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\".

Following ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'' (1970) and the less successful [[chamber jazz]]-inspired ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'' (1970), and ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'' (1971), the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation (swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation, reaching a new creative peak on ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' (1973), ''[[Starless and Bible Black]]'' (1974) and ''[[Red (King Crimson album)|Red]]'' (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974.\n\nIn 1981, King Crimson reformed with another change in musical direction and instrumentation (incorporating, for the first time, a mixture of British and American personnel plus doubled guitar and influences taken from [[gamelan]], [[post-punk]] and New York [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]). This lasted for three years, resulting in the trio of albums ''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'' (1981), ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (1982) and ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'' (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as an expanded \"Double Trio\" sextet in 1994, mingling its mid-\u201870s and 1980s approaches with new creative options available via [[MIDI]] technology. This resulted in another three-year cycle of activity including the release of ''[[Thrak]]'' (1995). King Crimson reunited again in 2000 as a more [[alternative metal]]-oriented quartet (or \"Double Duo\"), releasing ''[[The Construkction of Light]]'' in 2000 and ''[[The Power to Believe]]'' in 2003: after further personnel shuffles, the band expanded to a double-drummer quintet for a 2008 tour celebrating their 40th anniversary.\n\nFollowing another hiatus between 2009 and 2012, King Crimson reformed once again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline and the return of saxophone/flute to the lineup for the first time since 1972. This current version of King Crimson has continued to tour and to release live albums, significantly rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire previous career.\n\nSince 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as [[ProjeKcts]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn August 1967, brothers [[Michael Giles]] (drums) and [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), who had been professional musicians in various jobbing bands since their mid-teens in [[Dorset]], England, advertised for a singing organist to join their new group.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000657298|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Giles, Giles and Fripp | accessdate=8 August 2007 | last=Eder|first=Bruce |website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name=\"Voyage-PT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm|title=Interview with Robert Fripp|accessdate=19 August 2007|work=Musician magazine (archived page from elephant-talk.com)|year=1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100954/http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm |archivedate=8 February 2005}}</ref> Fellow Dorset musician [[Robert Fripp]]&nbsp;\u2013 a guitarist who did not sing&nbsp;\u2013 responded and the trio formed the band [[Giles, Giles and Fripp]].

The band's music drew on a wide range of influences provided by all five group members. These elements included romantic- and modernist-era classical music, the psychedelic rock spearheaded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], military music (partially inspired by McDonald's stint as an army musician), ambient improvisation, [[Victoriana]] and British pop.\n\nAfter playing shows across England, the band toured the US with various pop and rock acts. Their first show was at [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]]. While their original sound astounded contemporary audiences and critics,<ref name=AMGBIO /> creative tensions were already developing within the band. Giles and McDonald, still striving to cope with King Crimson's rapid success and the realities of touring life, became uneasy with the band's direction. Although he was neither the dominant composer in the band nor the frontman, Fripp was very much the band's driving force and spokesman, leading King Crimson into progressively darker and more intense musical areas. McDonald and Giles, now favouring a lighter and more romantic style of music, became increasingly uncomfortable with their position and resigned from the band during the US tour. To salvage what he saw as the most important elements of King Crimson, Fripp offered to resign himself, but McDonald and Giles declared that the band was \"more (him) than them\" and that they should therefore be the ones to leave.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> The line-up played their last show at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco on 16 December 1969.<ref name=epitaph /> Live recordings of the tour were released in 1997 on ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]''.\n\n=== 1970\u20131971: the \"interregnum\" \u2013 ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' and ''Lizard'' ===\n\nAfter their first US tour, King Crimson was in a state of flux with various line-up changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction.

It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album.<ref name=AMGBIO /> With no musicians to perform material from their new album, Fripp and Sinfield persuaded Haskell to join as singer and bassist and recruited [[Andrew McCulloch (drummer)|Andy McCulloch]] as drummer, retaining Collins as saxophonist, flautist and occasional keyboard player.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nDuring the writing sessions for the third album, ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'',<ref name=AMGBIO /> Haskell and McCulloch had no say in the direction of the material, since Fripp and Sinfield wrote the album themselves, bringing in Tippett, [[Mark Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Nick Evans (trombonist)|Nick Evans]] on trombone, and Robin Miller on [[oboe]] and [[cor anglais]] as additional musicians. Haskell sang and played bass. [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was also brought in to sing the first part of the album's title track, \"Prince Rupert Awakes\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell's range and style.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> ''Lizard'' featured stronger avant-garde jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums, as well as Sinfield's upfront experiments with processing and distorting sound through the [[EMS VCS 3]] synthesiser. It also featured complex lyrics from Sinfield, including a coded song about the break-up of [[the Beatles]], with almost the entire second side taken up by a predominantly instrumental chamber suite describing a medieval battle and its outcome. Released in December 1970, ''Lizard'' reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an \"acquired taste\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> ''Lizard'' was certainly not to the taste of the more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch, both of whom found the music difficult to relate to. As a result, Haskell quit the band acrimoniously after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects. McCulloch also departed,<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> leaving Fripp and Sinfield to recruit new members once more.\n\n=== 1971\u20131972: the ''Islands'' band ===\n\nAfter a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] on drums.

The position went to [[Boz Burrell|Raymond \"Boz\" Burrell]].<ref name=AMGBIO /> Bassist [[John Wetton]] was invited to join, but declined (at the time) in order to play with [[Family (band)|Family]].<ref name=\"SBHist\">{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/songforme/hist.htm |title=Strange Band \u2013 Family history |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> [[Rick Kemp]] also declined an offer to join,<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> leaving Fripp and Wallace teaching Burrell to play bass rather than continue auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument.<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nIn 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]''. Loosely influenced by [[Miles Davis]]'s orchestral collaborations with [[Gil Evans]] and [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental \"Sailor's Tale\", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). ''Islands'' also featured the band's only experiment with a string ensemble on \"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired \"Ladies of the Road\". A hint of trouble to come came when one member of the band allegedly described the more delicate and meditative parts of ''Islands'' as \"airy-fairy shit\".<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Released in December 1971, ''Islands'' charted at No. 30 in the UK and No. 76 in the US. Following a period of touring ''Islands'', Fripp asked Sinfield to leave the band,<ref name=AMGBIO /> citing musical differences and a loss of faith in his partner's ideas.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> The remaining band broke up acrimoniously in rehearsals shortly afterward, owing to Fripp's refusal to incorporate other members' compositions into the band's repertoire. He later cited this as \"quality control\", with the idea that King Crimson would perform the \"right kind\" of music.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nKing Crimson reformed to fulfil touring commitments in 1972, with the intention of disbanding afterwards.<ref name=AMGBIO /> Recordings from various North American dates between January and February 1972 were released as ''[[Earthbound (King Crimson album)|Earthbound]]'' in June 1972,<ref name=AMGBIO /> noted and criticised for its sub-par sound quality and playing style that occasionally veered towards [[funk]], with [[scat singing]] on the improvised pieces.<ref name=\"BBCMUSIC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/n3qv/|title=Earthbound, USA & Thrak|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=[[BBC Music]] (bbc.co.uk)}}</ref><ref name=\"EBOUND\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000224180|pure_url=yes}}|title=Earthbound|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic|first=Lindsay |last=Planer }}</ref> By this time, a definite musical rift between Fripp and the rest of the band existed, since Wallace, Burrell and Collins favoured a more rhythm-and-blues style.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Though personal relations improved during the 1972 tour (to the point where most of the band wished to continue), Fripp opted to part company with the existing band and to restructure King Crimson with new members, since he felt the current members wouldn't be able to play the new material he had in mind.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\n=== 1972\u20131975: the \"European improvisers\" \u2013 ''Larks' Tongues in Aspic'', ''Starless and Bible Black'', ''Red'', and hiatus ===\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"It was going to be an interesting ride when ...

Following the album's release, the band began to divide once more, this time over performance. Musically, Fripp found himself positioned between Bruford and Wetton, who played with such force and increasing volume that Fripp once compared them to \"a flying brick wall\",<ref name=InTheCourtOfKingCrimson /> and Cross, whose amplified acoustic violin was increasingly being drowned out by the rhythm section, leading him to concentrate more on keyboards. An increasingly frustrated Cross began to withdraw musically and personally, with the result that he was voted out of the group following the band's 1974 tour of Europe and America.<ref name=InTheCourtOfKingCrimson />\n\n[[File:Robert Fripp 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fripp performing in 1974]]\nIn July 1974 Fripp, Bruford, and Wetton began recording ''[[Red (King Crimson album)|Red]]''.<ref name=AMGBIO /> Before recording began, Fripp, now increasingly disillusioned with the music business, turned his attention to the works of Russian mystic [[George Gurdjieff]]<ref name=BOOK /> and experienced a spiritual crisis-cum-awakening; he later described it as if \"the top of my head blew off\".<ref name=InTheCourtOfKingCrimson /> Though most of the album was already written, Fripp retreated into himself in the studio and \"withdrew his opinion\", leaving Bruford and Wetton to direct most of the recording sessions. The album contains studio recorded material with one live track, \"Providence\", recorded on 30 June 1974 with Cross in the group. Several musicians, including some from past King Crimson line-ups, contribute to the album. Released in October 1974, ''Red'' went to No. 45 in the UK and No. 66 in the US.

In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the [[Chapman Stick]], a ten-string polyphonic two-handed [[tapping]] guitar instrument that has a bass and treble range and which he played in an \"utterly original style\".<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Why Robert Fripp Resurrected King Crimson|pages=|language=|work=The New York Times |date=November 1981|url=}}</ref> Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a [[Simmons SDS-V]] electronic drum kit. The band's songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew's pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band's previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental (\"The Sheltering Sky\") emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted \"Indiscipline\" was a partially-written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album and to play against the beat in any way that he could.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Released in September 1981, ''Discipline'' reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US.\n\nIn June 1982, King Crimson followed ''Discipline'' with ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (the first King Crimson album recorded with the same band line-up as the album preceding it).<ref name=MM82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=[[Melody Maker]]|date=19 June 1982|url=}}</ref> None of the members of the group produced the record; Davies undertook production duties himself.<ref name=MM82 /> The album had a loosely linked theme of the [[Beat Generation]] and its writings,<ref name=NME82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|pages=|language=|work=New Musical Express |location=UK|date=3 July 1982|url=}}</ref> reflected in song titles such as \"Neal and Jack and Me\" (inspired by [[Neal Cassady]] and [[Jack Kerouac]]), \"The Howler\" (inspired by [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s \"[[Howl]]\") and \"Sartori in Tangier\" (inspired by [[Paul Bowles]]). Fripp asked Belew to read Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]''<ref name=ETFAQ /> for inspiration, and the album contained themes of travel, disorientation and loneliness. While the album was noticeably poppier than ''Discipline'', it featured the harsh, atonal and improvised \"Requiem\".\n\nRecording ''Beat'' was faced with tension with Belew suffering high stress levels over his duties as front man, lead singer, and principal songwriter. On one occasion, he clashed with Fripp and ordered him out of the studio.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /><ref name=brufordautobiography /> After differences were resolved, and while ''Beat'' reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 52 in the US, King Crimson resumed touring.  \"Heartbeat\" was released as a single which peaked at No. 57 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. Around this time the band released the VHS-only '\"The Noise: Live in Frejus\" (DGMVC2), a record of a show played at the Arena, [[Frejus]], France on 27 August 1982. (This video is now on DVD as part of the compilation [[Neal and Jack and Me]].)\n\nKing Crimson's next album, ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'', was recorded in 1983 and released in March 1984. Having encountered difficulty in both writing and determining a direction for the album, the band chose to record and sequence it as a \"left side\" \u2014 four of the band's poppier songs plus an instrumental \u2014 and a \"right side\" (experimental work including extended and atonal improvisations in the tradition of the mid-1970s band, plus as the third part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\"). ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 58 in the US, with \"[[Three of a Perfect Pair (song)|Three of a Perfect Pair]]\" and \"[[Sleepless (King Crimson song)|Sleepless]]\" being released as singles. The 2001 remaster of the album included \"the other side\", a collection of remixes and improvisation out-takes plus Levin's tongue-in-cheek vocal piece, \"The King Crimson Barbershop\". The last concert of the ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' tour, at the [[Spectrum (Montreal)|Spectrum]] in Montreal, Canada on 11 July 1984, was recorded and released in 1998 as ''[[Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal]]''.\n\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"Robert broke up the group, again, for the umpteenth time, dwelling at length, I suppose on our lack of imagination, ability, direction and a thousand other things we were doubtless missing.

Bruford and Belew expressed some frustration over this; Belew recalled the first he had heard of the split was when he read about it in a report in ''Musician'' magazine. Despite these circumstances, the musicians remained on fairly amicable terms. Belew would later refer to the band \"taking a break\" that ultimately lasted for ten years.\n\n=== 1994\u20131999: the Double Trio \u2013 ''Vroooom'', ''THRAK'', and the ProjeKcts ===\nIn the early 1990s, Belew met with Fripp in England with an interest in a reformed King Crimson. Two years later, in 1992, Fripp established the [[Discipline Global Mobile]] (DGM) record label with producer [[David Singleton]]: this would subsequently be the main home for Fripp's work, with main album releases distributed to larger record companies, affording Fripp and his associates greater freedom and more control over their work.\n\nAfter a tour with [[David Sylvian]] in 1993 (who declined an offer to join Crimson), Fripp began to assemble a new version of the band, a union between the band's previous incarnation and the Sylvian & Fripp group: he was joined with Belew, Levin, Bruford, Chapman Stick player [[Trey Gunn]] (a [[Guitar Craft]] alumnus), and drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] (who replaced the first choice, [[Jerry Marotta]]). Fripp explained the six-member formation was to be a \"Double Trio\" with two guitarists, two bassists, and two drummers, to explore a different style of music. Bruford later said he lobbied his own way into the band, believing that King Crimson was very much \"his gig\", and that Fripp had come up with the philosophical explanation later.

In contrast, many of the actual songs \u2013 mostly written or finalised by Belew \u2013 displayed stronger elements of 1960s pop than before \u2013 in particular, a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] influence (although Bruford would also refer to the band as sounding like \"a dissonant [[The Shadows (band)|Shadows]] on steroids\"<ref name=brufordautobiography />).

Instead, the six members (including Bruford) opted to work in four smaller groups (or \"fraKctalisations\", according to Fripp) known as the [[ProjeKcts]]. This enabled the group to continue developing musical ideas and searching for Crimson's next direction without the practical difficulty and expense of convening all six members at once. In 1998 and 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the US, Japan, and the UK and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation.<ref name=RSBIO /> These have been collectively described by music critic [[J. D. Considine]] as \"frequently astonishing\" but lacking in melody, and perhaps too difficult for a casual listener.<ref name=RSBIO />\n\n=== 2000\u20132010: the Double Duo and the second quintet \u2013 ''The Construkction of Light'', ''The Power to Believe'', 40th Anniversary tour, third hiatus ===\nAt the end of the four ProjeKct runs, Bruford left King Crimson altogether to resume his work in jazz. At the same time, Levin's commitments as a session and touring musician forced him to take an indefinite break from the band. The remaining members (Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto) reconvened as a \"Double Duo\" to write and record ''[[The Construkction of Light]]''<ref name=DGMBIO /> in Belew's basement and garage near [[Nashville]]. Released in May 2000, the album reached No. 129 in the UK. All of the pieces were metallic and harsh in sound, similar to the work of contemporary [[alternative metal]]. They featured a distinct electronic texture, a heavy processed drum sound from Mastelotto, Gunn continuing on Warr Guitar but now taking over the bass role, and a different take on the interlocked guitar sound that the band had used since the 1980s. With the exception of a parodic industrial blues (sung by Belew through a voice changer under the pseudonym of \"Hooter J. Johnson\"), the songs were unrelentingly complex and challenging to the listener, with plenty of rhythmic displacement to add to the harsh textures. The album contains the [[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part IV|fourth instalment]] of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\".

Occasionally, particular improvised pieces will be recalled and reworked in different forms at different shows, becoming more and more refined and eventually appearing on official studio releases (the most recent example being \"Power to Believe III\", which originally existed as the stage improvisation \"Deception of the Thrush\", a piece played on stage for a long time before appearing on record).<ref name=\"TPTBPA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=kc-tptb|title=The Power to Believe|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=Prog Archives (progreviews.com)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831182245/http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=kc-tptb|archivedate=31 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nKing Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and numerous contemporary artists.

They transformed \"My Favorite Things\", the cheerful populist song from 'The Sound of Music,' into a hypnotic eastern [[dervish]] dance. The recording was a hit and became Coltrane's most requested tune\u2014and a bridge to broad public acceptance.</blockquote>\n\nOn March 3, 1998, [[Rhino Records]] reissued ''My Favorite Things'' as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series.

The melody is heard numerous times throughout, but instead of playing solos over the written [[chord changes]], both Tyner and Coltrane take extended solos over [[Vamp (music)|vamps]] of the two [[tonic (music)|tonic]] chords, [[E minor]] and [[E major]], played in [[waltz time]].<ref>Porter, pp. 182-183.</ref> In the documentary ''[[The World According to John Coltrane]]'', narrator Ed Wheeler remarks on the impact that this song's popularity had on Coltrane's career:\n<blockquote>In 1960, Coltrane left Miles [Davis] and formed his own quartet to further explore modal playing, freer directions, and a growing Indian influence. They transformed \"My Favorite Things\", the cheerful populist song from 'The Sound of Music,' into a hypnotic eastern [[dervish]] dance. The recording was a hit and became Coltrane's most requested tune\u2014and a bridge to broad public acceptance.</blockquote>\n\nOn March 3, 1998, [[Rhino Records]] reissued ''My Favorite Things'' as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series.
