A fuel shortage forces the plane down in the Pacific. The PN9 drifts to an uncharted island.  Once the crews travel to the island, they find a hermit and a beautiful woman played by Virginia Fry.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting. Now they are usually awarded at joint mathematics meetings.\n}}</small>\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize|Kavli Prize <small>in Astrophysics</small>]] (2008)<ref name=kavli1>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=ucsc.edu|date=27 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=kavli2>{{cite web|author=Ham Chau|url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists|website=English.vietnamnet.vn|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=ambartsumian>{{cite journal |date=1 December 2009 |title=New international prize commemorates Viktor Ambartsumian|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/50/6/6.6/192554|journal=Astronomy & Geophysics|volume=50|issue=6|pages=6.6 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2009.50604_10.x|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Gruber Prize in Cosmology|Gruber Prize <small>in Cosmology</small>]] (2000)<ref name=ambartsumian/><ref name=gruber1>{{cite web|url=https://science.tamu.edu/news/2007/07/texas-am-physicist-shares-in-500000-gruber-cosmology-prize/|title=Texas A&M Physicist Shares in $500,000 Gruber Cosmology Prize|website=tamu.edu|date=17 July 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Crafoord Prize|Crafoord Prize <small>in Astronomy</small>]] (1985)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/prof-eugene-parker-wins-prestigious-crafoord-prize-astronomy|title=Prof. Eugene Parker wins prestigious Crafoord Prize in Astronomy|website=uchicago.edu|author=Louise Lerner|date=30 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=55209|title=Crafoord Prize in Astronomy to Solar Wind Discoverer Eugene Parker|website=spaceref.com|date=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Shaw Prize|Shaw Prize <small>in Astronomy</small>]] (2004)<ref name=shaw1>{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2006/06/21/berkeley-labs-saul-perlmutter-wins-shaw-prize-in-astronomy/|title=Berkeley Lab's Saul Perlmutter Wins Shaw Prize in Astronomy|date=21 June 2006|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=shaw2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/solana-beach/article_3b3d1a4d-261f-5ed0-9277-6d84554b28d9.html|title=Solana Beach: Astronomy researcher gets $1 million Shaw Prize|date=17 June 2009|work=[[North County Times]]|accessdate=20 November 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117150938/http://nctimes.com/news/local/solana-beach/article_3b3d1a4d-261f-5ed0-9277-6d84554b28d9.html|archivedate=17 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=shaw3>{{cite web|url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/astronomer-john-hawley-wins-2013-shaw-prize-astronomy|title=ASTRONOMER JOHN HAWLEY WINS 2013 SHAW PRIZE IN ASTRONOMY|date=29 May 2013|website=virginia.edu|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=shaw4>{{cite web|url=https://www.asianscientist.com/2014/05/topnews/scientists-honored-2014-shaw-prize-2014/|title=Six Scientists Honored With 2014 Shaw Prize|date=29 May 2014|website=asianscientist.com|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n''See also [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] (1824), [[Bruce Medal]] (1898), [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics]] (1980), [[Viktor Ambartsumian#Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize|Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize]] (2010).''\n}}</small>\n\n====Automation/control/cybernetics====\n* [[IEEE Control Systems Award]] (1982)<ref name=shanghairanking2018>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/Methodology-for-ShanghaiRanking-Global-Ranking-of-Academic-Subjects-2018.html|title=Methodology for ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2018|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>  \n* Giorgio Quazza Medal (1981)<ref name=controlhistory>{{cite web|url=https://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/49560469/TFRT_7561.pdf|title=Projects in History of Automatic Control|website=lu.se|author=Karl Henrik Johansson, Karl Johan \u00c5str\u00f6m|date=June 1997\n}}</ref>  \n* Hendrik W.

It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful [[gait]]. Traditionally, the ears are [[Cropping (animal)|cropped]] and posted and the tail is [[docking (dog)|docked]]. However, in some countries, these are now illegal. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.\n\nDobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and [[guard dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/opinion/l-dobermans-suffer-from-a-bad-press-003793.html|title=Dobermans Suffer From a Bad Press|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and trained properly, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.\n\n== Appearance ==\nWorld [[Breed standard]]s are published by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]], or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square.\nIt should also appear elegant and noble.\n\nThe dog was originally intended as a guard dog,<ref name=\"akc\">{{cite web\n|publisher=American Kennel Club\n|url = http://www.akc.org/breeds/doberman_pinscher/index.cfm\n|title= American Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard.\n|accessdate = 4 February 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"ckc\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ckc.ca/en/Files/Forms/Shows-Trials/Breed-Standards/Group-3-Working/DBP-Doberman-Pinscher\n|title=Canadian Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard.\n|quote=Size: \"Males, decidedly masculine, without coarseness.

This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently.<ref name=\"akc\"/>\n\n=== Size and proportions ===\nAlthough the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as {{convert|68|to|72|cm|in}} at the [[withers]];<ref name=\"FCI\" /> [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK quotes {{convert|69|cm|in}} as being ideal.<ref name=\"ukc\" /> The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is {{convert|63|to|68|cm|in}},<ref name=FCI/> with {{convert|65|cm|in}} being ideal.<ref name=\"ukc\">{{cite web\n|publisher=The Kennel Club (UK)\n|url = http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=5121\n|title= UK Kennel Club: Dobermann breed standard.\n|accessdate = 6 February 2009\n}}</ref> The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body.<ref name=\"akc\"/>\n\nThe standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility.<ref name=\"ukc\"/> The ideal weight of male dogs is described as {{convert|40|-|45|kg|lb}}<ref name=FCI/> and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be {{convert|32|-|35|kg|lb}}.<ref name=FCI/>\n\n=== Color ===\nTwo different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for ''black'' (B) and one for ''color dilution'' (D). There are nine possible combinations of these [[allele]]s, which can result in four different color [[phenotypes]]: black, blue, red, and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]] (Isabella).<ref name=\"DPCA-color\">{{cite web\n|url=http://dpca.org/breed/breed_color.htm\n|publisher= Doberman Pinscher Club of America\n|title= Color Chart\n|accessdate=23 March 2007\n}}</ref> The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one [[Dominant gene|dominant]] allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd) and is commonly referred to as ''black'', ''black and rust,'' or ''black and tan''. The ''red'', ''red rust,'' or ''brown'' coloration occurs when the black gene has two [[Recessive gene|recessive]] alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The ''blue'' Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The ''fawn'' coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.\n\nExpression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called [[Canine follicular dysplasia|Color Dilution Alopecia]], a kind of canine follicular dysplasia.

This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to \"fix\" the mutation. White Dobermanns are a cream color with white markings and blue eyes.

These traits served the dog well in its role as a [[Guard dog|personal defense dog]], [[police dog]], or [[Dogs in warfare|war dog]], but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however. Today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability.  The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless, and obedient.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n[[File:Dobermannwurf.jpg|thumb|right|Doberman Pinscher puppies]]\nThey can easily learn to respect and protect their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the ''most'' likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners.\n\nThere is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders.<ref name=\"coren\">{{cite book\n| title=Why does my dog act that way?\n| author=Stanley Coren\n| publisher=Simon & Schuster\n| year=2006\n| isbn=978-0-7432-7706-8\n| url=https://archive.org/details/whydoesmydogactt00core\n}}</ref> Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits.

There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined.<ref name=\"scott\">{{cite book\n|author1=Scott, J.P.\n|author2=Fuller, J.L.\n|year=1966\n|title=Genetics and the Social Behavior of the Dog\n|publisher=University of Chicago Press\n|isbn=978-0-226-74338-7\n|url=https://archive.org/details/dogbehaviorgenet00scot\n}}</ref> Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine [[Personality psychology|personality]] or temperament by using [[factor Analysis|statistical]] techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability.<ref>{{cite journal\n|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science\n|title=Breed-typical behaviour in dogs\u2014Historical remnants or recent constructs?\n|author=Kenth Svartberg\n|year=2006\n|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.014\n|volume=96\n|issue=3\u20134\n|pages=293\u2013313\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.515.7023\n}}</ref> Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.<ref name=\"draper\">\n{{citation\n|author=Thomas Draper\n|year=1995\n|title=Canine analogs of human personality factors\n|journal=Journal of General Psychology\n|volume=122\n|issue=3\n|doi=10.1080/00221309.1995.9921236\n|pmid=7650520\n|pages=241\u2013252\n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression.

The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., [[Cocker Spaniel]], Dalmatian, and [[Great Dane]]). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall.<ref name=\"duffy2008\"/> In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.\n\nAccording to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dogs]], [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Husky]]-type dogs, [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s and [[Alaskan Malamute]]s.<ref name=\"CDC\">[https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/dogbreeds.pdf US Centers for Disease Control: Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998].

With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after his death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Doberman Pinschers| last= Donnelly| first= Kerry| publisher= T.F.H.

The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the [[Beauceron]], [[German Pinscher]], [[Rottweiler]] and [[Weimaraner]].<ref name=\"Breeds\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dpca.org/breed/breed_history.htm |title=Breed history |publisher= Dobermann Pinscher Club of America |accessdate= 24 August 2016}}</ref> The single exception is the documented crossing with the [[Greyhound]] and [[Manchester Terrier]]. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's ''The Dobermann Pinscher'' (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed. The [[American Kennel Club]] believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n\nAfter Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an \"n\" from Dobermann's surname.<ref name=\"Breeds\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official [[war dog]], although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.\n\nIn the United States, the [[American Kennel Club]] ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title= AKC Dog Registration Statistics| publisher= American Kennel Club| website= AKC.org| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173939/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archivedate= 16 July 2007| access-date= 6 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nThe Dobermann became very popular over a short period of time.

The Dobermann was recognised (as the Doberman Pinscher) by the American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they have been one of the most popular dog breeds due to their intelligence and agility. Even today, the numbers of Dobermann dog registrations are increasing.<ref>{{cite web|title= Doberman Dog Breed Information|author=Dogspot|url=https://www.dogspot.in/dobermann/}}</ref> They are also featured in the music video \"[[What's My Name?

It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful [[gait]]. Traditionally, the ears are [[Cropping (animal)|cropped]] and posted and the tail is [[docking (dog)|docked]]. However, in some countries, these are now illegal. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.\n\nDobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and [[guard dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/opinion/l-dobermans-suffer-from-a-bad-press-003793.html|title=Dobermans Suffer From a Bad Press|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and trained properly, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.\n\n== Appearance ==\nWorld [[Breed standard]]s are published by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]], or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square.\nIt should also appear elegant and noble.\n\nThe dog was originally intended as a guard dog,<ref name=\"akc\">{{cite web\n|publisher=American Kennel Club\n|url = http://www.akc.org/breeds/doberman_pinscher/index.cfm\n|title= American Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard.\n|accessdate = 4 February 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"ckc\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ckc.ca/en/Files/Forms/Shows-Trials/Breed-Standards/Group-3-Working/DBP-Doberman-Pinscher\n|title=Canadian Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard.\n|quote=Size: \"Males, decidedly masculine, without coarseness.

This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently.<ref name=\"akc\"/>\n\n=== Size and proportions ===\nAlthough the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as {{convert|68|to|72|cm|in}} at the [[withers]];<ref name=\"FCI\" /> [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK quotes {{convert|69|cm|in}} as being ideal.<ref name=\"ukc\" /> The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is {{convert|63|to|68|cm|in}},<ref name=FCI/> with {{convert|65|cm|in}} being ideal.<ref name=\"ukc\">{{cite web\n|publisher=The Kennel Club (UK)\n|url = http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=5121\n|title= UK Kennel Club: Dobermann breed standard.\n|accessdate = 6 February 2009\n}}</ref> The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body.<ref name=\"akc\"/>\n\nThe standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI.

There are nine possible combinations of these [[allele]]s, which can result in four different color [[phenotypes]]: black, blue, red, and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]] (Isabella).<ref name=\"DPCA-color\">{{cite web\n|url=http://dpca.org/breed/breed_color.htm\n|publisher= Doberman Pinscher Club of America\n|title= Color Chart\n|accessdate=23 March 2007\n}}</ref> The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one [[Dominant gene|dominant]] allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd) and is commonly referred to as ''black'', ''black and rust,'' or ''black and tan''. The ''red'', ''red rust,'' or ''brown'' coloration occurs when the black gene has two [[Recessive gene|recessive]] alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The ''blue'' Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The ''fawn'' coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.\n\nExpression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called [[Canine follicular dysplasia|Color Dilution Alopecia]], a kind of canine follicular dysplasia. Although not life-threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.<ref name=\"dilution\">{{cite journal\n|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3164.1990.tb00089.x\n|title=Colour Dilution Alopecia in Doberman Pinschers with Blue or Fawn Coat Colours: A Study on the Incidence and Histopathology of this Disorder\n|author=WILLIAM H.

This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to \"fix\" the mutation. White Dobermanns are a cream color with white markings and blue eyes.

These traits served the dog well in its role as a [[Guard dog|personal defense dog]], [[police dog]], or [[Dogs in warfare|war dog]], but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however. Today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability.  The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless, and obedient.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n[[File:Dobermannwurf.jpg|thumb|right|Doberman Pinscher puppies]]\nThey can easily learn to respect and protect their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the ''most'' likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners.\n\nThere is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders.<ref name=\"coren\">{{cite book\n| title=Why does my dog act that way?\n| author=Stanley Coren\n| publisher=Simon & Schuster\n| year=2006\n| isbn=978-0-7432-7706-8\n| url=https://archive.org/details/whydoesmydogactt00core\n}}</ref> Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits. Although many contemporary Doberman Pinschers in North America are gentle and friendly to strangers, some lines are bred more true to the original personality standard.<ref name=\"dcpa-temp\">{{cite web\n|url=http://dpca.org/breed/breed_temperament.htm\n|title=A candid look at Doberman temperament\n|accessdate=9 February 2009\n|publisher=The Doberman Pinscher Club of America\n}}</ref>\n\nThe personality of the Doberman Pinscher is known to be unique. There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined.<ref name=\"scott\">{{cite book\n|author1=Scott, J.P.\n|author2=Fuller, J.L.\n|year=1966\n|title=Genetics and the Social Behavior of the Dog\n|publisher=University of Chicago Press\n|isbn=978-0-226-74338-7\n|url=https://archive.org/details/dogbehaviorgenet00scot\n}}</ref> Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine [[Personality psychology|personality]] or temperament by using [[factor Analysis|statistical]] techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability.<ref>{{cite journal\n|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science\n|title=Breed-typical behaviour in dogs\u2014Historical remnants or recent constructs?\n|author=Kenth Svartberg\n|year=2006\n|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.014\n|volume=96\n|issue=3\u20134\n|pages=293\u2013313\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.515.7023\n}}</ref> Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.<ref name=\"draper\">\n{{citation\n|author=Thomas Draper\n|year=1995\n|title=Canine analogs of human personality factors\n|journal=Journal of General Psychology\n|volume=122\n|issue=3\n|doi=10.1080/00221309.1995.9921236\n|pmid=7650520\n|pages=241\u2013252\n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression.

The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., [[Cocker Spaniel]], Dalmatian, and [[Great Dane]]). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall.<ref name=\"duffy2008\"/> In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.\n\nAccording to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dogs]], [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Husky]]-type dogs, [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s and [[Alaskan Malamute]]s.<ref name=\"CDC\">[https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/dogbreeds.pdf US Centers for Disease Control: Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998].

With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after his death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Doberman Pinschers| last= Donnelly| first= Kerry| publisher= T.F.H. Publications |year=1988 |isbn= |location= US| pages= 8\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title= Basic Guide to the Doberman Pinscher |last=|first= |publisher= Dace Publishing |year= 1997| isbn= |location= US |pages= 9\u201311}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dobermann Pinscher from 1915.JPG|thumb|left|Dobermann Pinscher, 1915]]\nThe breed is believed to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the characteristics that Dobermann was looking for. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the [[Beauceron]], [[German Pinscher]], [[Rottweiler]] and [[Weimaraner]].<ref name=\"Breeds\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dpca.org/breed/breed_history.htm |title=Breed history |publisher= Dobermann Pinscher Club of America |accessdate= 24 August 2016}}</ref> The single exception is the documented crossing with the [[Greyhound]] and [[Manchester Terrier]]. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's ''The Dobermann Pinscher'' (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed. The [[American Kennel Club]] believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n\nAfter Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an \"n\" from Dobermann's surname.<ref name=\"Breeds\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official [[war dog]], although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.\n\nIn the United States, the [[American Kennel Club]] ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title= AKC Dog Registration Statistics| publisher= American Kennel Club| website= AKC.org| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173939/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archivedate= 16 July 2007| access-date= 6 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nThe Dobermann became very popular over a short period of time. It is a relatively new breed, less than 150 years old.

Dobermanns started to become popular when they were used in World War II as guard dogs. In the 1970s, Dobermanns had their fair share in movies. They starred in the 1972 American film ''[[The Doberman Gang]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Doberman Gang, The |journal=Monthly Film Bulletin |date=January 1974 |volume=41 |issue=480 |page=174}}</ref> Dobermanns also became popular after winning four Westminster Kennel Club Dog Shows in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1989. The Dobermann was recognised (as the Doberman Pinscher) by the American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they have been one of the most popular dog breeds due to their intelligence and agility. Even today, the numbers of Dobermann dog registrations are increasing.<ref>{{cite web|title= Doberman Dog Breed Information|author=Dogspot|url=https://www.dogspot.in/dobermann/}}</ref> They are also featured in the music video \"[[What's My Name?
