The present-timeline version of the character has very little to no interest in fulfilling Gero's orders and becomes a major character in the series after marrying Goku's best friend [[Krillin]].\n\nIn an alternate timeline, Android 18 is a ruthless killer who started a reign of terror along with Android 17 over Earth that lasted for twenty years until they are destroyed by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]].\n\n== Creation and conception ==\n[[File:Cosplayer of Android 18, Dragon Ball Z at Comic Exhibition 20170813a.jpg|thumb|The official cosplayer of Android 18 of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] Taiwan]]\n[[File:Cosplayer of Android 18, Dragon Ball Z at Comic Exhibition 20170813b.jpg|thumb|The official cosplayer of Android 18 of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] Taiwan]]\nAndroid #18, along with Android #17, were conceived after Akira Toriyama's former editor [[Kazuhiko Torishima]] expressed disapproval with [[Android 19|Androids #19]] and [[Android 20|#20]] as villains.

Her hairstyle is shown to have changed 10 years after the defeat of Majin Buu, becoming shorter. She has this same hairstyle in ''Dragon Ball GT''.\n\nAndroid #18 is introduced wearing a denim jacket and skirt, dark blue leggings, brown boots and a black shirt with black and white sleeves.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 13, chapter 155</ref> After arriving at Goku's home, she gains a new outfit, first seen when she is depicted going through his wife Chi-Chi's closet; a white short sleeve shirt underneath a black vest, a pair of blue green jeans, black gloves with a ring on the left arm and black flats with orange socks.

Her attire remains mostly unchanged for the sequel ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|Resurrection 'F']]'' apart from her no longer wearing the necklace and wearing blue boots. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Android 18 is shown with two different outfits. The first is a red long sleeve turtleneck with black pants and red high heels with earrings. The second is a purple blazer with a pink undershirt and matching pants alongside the same red heels and earrings from earlier.\n\n=== Voice actors ===\n[[File:ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg|thumb|Colleen Clinkenbeard was the voice of Android 18 during Meredith McCoy's hiatus.]]\nIn the Japanese version of the entire ''Dragon Ball'' anime series and subsequent related media, Android 18 is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]].\n\nIn English, Android 18 is voiced by [[Meredith McCoy]] in the Funimation dub of ''Dragon Ball Z'' and ''Dragon Ball GT'' except for ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'', where she is voiced by [[Colleen Clinkenbeard]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-07/dragon-ball-z-kai-buu-saga-to-air-on-toonami/.109619|title=Dragon Ball Z Kai's Buu Saga to Air on Toonami|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}</ref> However, since ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]],'' Meredith has returned to the role.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-04/dragon-ball-super-new-opening-sequence-previewed-in-screenshots/.111849|title=Dragon Ball Super's New Opening Sequence Previewed in Screenshots|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Abilities ===\nFollowing her conversion into a cyborg, Android 18 possesses superhuman strength, durability, speed and reflexes.<ref name=chapter159>''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 159</ref> She also has the ability to fly.<ref name=chapter157>''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 157</ref> Thanks to her conversion into a cyborg, she has eternal youth and unlike the other characters in the series, has energy that is not detectable with ''Ki Sense'',  which causes them to not be directly found using the standard method of identifying a warrior and their strength.\n\nIn regards to her strength, upon her introduction, the main timeline version of Android 18 is shown to be able to defeat Vegeta and Trunks in their Super Saiyan forms, Piccolo and Tenshinhan, Trunks stating afterward that she is stronger than her counterpart in his timeline. This effectively makes her one of the stronger characters in the series at the time, Android 17 being said to be slightly stronger and Android 16 having more strength than both of them. Regardless, she still can easily overwhelm all of the heroes, as can her alternate timeline counterpart. However, her advantage in strength falters by the time she encounters Cell who in his first form, after absorbing a large portion of the human population and effectively increasing his power, fights on par with Android 16 and easily subdues both him and Android 18 in his second form. By the time seven years pass after Cell's defeat, Android 18 is now outclassed by Gohan, Vegeta and Piccolo, though still is stronger than the other characters. Since then, Android 18 has been easily bested by Boo and Beerus, though still is one of the most powerful characters on Earth.\n\nShe is capable of using the {{nihongo|''Power Blitz''|\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Paw\u0101 Burittsu}}, a sphere energy wave she fires after drawing back her hand which is either pink or blue in color as well as a rapid-fire variation called {{nihongo|''Infiniti Bullet''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Infiniti Barrette}}.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 420</ref> Android 18 also possess {{nihongo|High-Pressure Energy Wave|\u9ad8\u5727\u7e2e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6ce2|Koasshuku Enerug\u012b-Ha}}.

They are identical in appearance to the versions of the two in the present timeline, Android 18 wearing the ensemble she wore in the main timeline upon her activation by Dr. Gero. Within the months of their release, shortly after the death of Goku, they kill their timeline's versions of Piccolo, Vegeta, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien and Yajirobe, Gohan managing to escape. Several years later, they kill Gohan and then nearly kill Trunks three years later when he confronts the pair during one of their killing sprees. When Trunks returns from the past, now vastly stronger than he was in their previous encounter as a result of his training, she shows interest in finally ending his life after he confronts her and Android 17, but is killed by him instead.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 225</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Free the Future|number=194|series=Dragon Ball Z|date=July 21, 1993}}</ref>\n\nSeven years later, she has married Krillin and has a daughter with him named {{nihongo4|Marron|\u30de\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3|M\u0101ron}}. She convinces Krillin to participate in the 25th Tenka'ichi Bud\u014dkai for the money along with her. Thanks to a lack of interest in being exposed as super-powered, she disguises her strength in hitting the Punching Machine, hitting it lightly and thereby altering who she is matched to fight.

It was initially a literary and social studies club organized in the 1905\u20131906 school year at [[Cornell University]] but later evolved into a fraternity with a founding date of December 4, 1906, at Cornell. It employs an icon from Ancient Egypt, the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], as its symbol. Its aims are \"Manly Deeds, Scholarship, and Love For All Mankind,\" and its motto is \"First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.\" Its archives are preserved at the [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].\n\nChapters were chartered at [[Howard University]] and [[Virginia Union University]] in 1907. The fraternity has over 290,000 members and has been open to men of all races since 1945. Currently, there are more than 730 active chapters in the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and Asia. It is the largest predominately African-American intercollegiate fraternity and one of the ten largest intercollegiate fraternities in the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.campusexplorer.com/college-advice-tips/0BCBEEAE/10-Largest-Fraternities/|title=10 Largest Fraternities|website=www.campusexplorer.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha is a social organization with a service organization mission and provided leadership and service during the [[Great Depression]], [[World war|World Wars]], and [[Civil Rights Movement]].

National programs and initiatives of the fraternity include A Voteless People Is a Hopeless People, My Brother's Keeper, Go To High School, Go To College, Project Alpha, and the [[World Policy Council]].

It was initially a literary and social studies club organized in the 1905\u20131906 school year at [[Cornell University]] but later evolved into a fraternity with a founding date of December 4, 1906, at Cornell. It employs an icon from Ancient Egypt, the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], as its symbol. Its aims are \"Manly Deeds, Scholarship, and Love For All Mankind,\" and its motto is \"First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.\" Its archives are preserved at the [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].\n\nChapters were chartered at [[Howard University]] and [[Virginia Union University]] in 1907. The fraternity has over 290,000 members and has been open to men of all races since 1945. Currently, there are more than 730 active chapters in the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and Asia. It is the largest predominately African-American intercollegiate fraternity and one of the ten largest intercollegiate fraternities in the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.campusexplorer.com/college-advice-tips/0BCBEEAE/10-Largest-Fraternities/|title=10 Largest Fraternities|website=www.campusexplorer.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha is a social organization with a service organization mission and provided leadership and service during the [[Great Depression]], [[World war|World Wars]], and [[Civil Rights Movement]].  The fraternity addresses social issues such as apartheid, AIDS, urban housing, and other economic, cultural, and political issues of interest to people of color. National programs and initiatives of the fraternity include A Voteless People Is a Hopeless People, My Brother's Keeper, Go To High School, Go To College, Project Alpha, and the [[World Policy Council]].  It also conducts philanthropic programming initiatives with the [[March of Dimes]], [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]].\n\nMembers of this fraternity include many historical civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[NAACP]] founder [[W.

Family and friends reported that Doyley was asked to drink an unidentified toxic cocktail off campus by members of Alpha Phi Alpha that caused him to suddenly vomit blood according to a close family friend. Doyley was taken to a local hospital for an emergency surgery where he eventually died. The chapter connected with the death of Doyley was suspended by the college and members of the fraternity while under investigation for homicide charges. A report published, citing a preliminary autopsy and unnamed police sources, stated that \"there is no evidence of hazing in the death last week of a student at Buffalo State College in New York.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-students-bizarre-death-linked-to-frat-hazing_us_56c8b1e7e4b041136f173554|title=College Student's Bizarre Death Allegedly Linked To Frat Hazing|first=Andy|last=Campbell|date=February 20, 2016|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Virginia Tech University banned the fraternity until 2026 for misconduct and severely abusing pledges.

Tyler went with other pledges and members of the fraternity to [[Mount Rubidoux]] where the ambulance was called to pick him up and take him to the hospital before his death.

The work was not widely circulated in the author's lifetime. Eriugena was assisted by one, possibly two other persons in writing the book, based on the presence of margin notes indicating the penmanship of two separate persons.

''Natura'' is the name for the universal, the totality of all things, containing in itself [[being|being and non-being]]. It is the unity of which all special phenomena are manifestations.<blockquote>Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which the infinite, transcendent and 'unknown' God, who is beyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation, procession, or 'self-creation', proceeds from his divine 'darkness' or 'non-being' into the light of being, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same timeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation... He treats of the essentially dialectical relation between Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation and creation culminates in return to the divine.<ref name=Moran>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ Moran, Dermot, \"John Scottus Eriugena\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N.

The \"creation\" of the world is in reality a ''theophania'', or showing forth of the Essence of God in the things created. Just as He reveals Himself to the mind and the soul in higher intellectual and spiritual truth, so He reveals Himself to the senses in the created world around us. Creation is, therefore, a process of unfolding of the Divine Nature. Nature in the second sense, is the world of primordial causes, or ideas, which the Father \"created\" in the Son, and which in turn \"create\", that is determine the generic and specific natures of concrete visible things. Since they are, though created, identical with God, and since their locus is the Word of God, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, they are operative causes and not merely static types. From this, however, it is not necessary to infer, as some critics have done, that according to Eriugena the primordial causes are identical with the Word. As examples of primordial causes Eriugena enumerates goodness, wisdom, intuition (insight), understanding, virtue, greatness, power, etc.<ref name=Turner>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05519a.htm  Turner, William. \"John Scotus Eriugena.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5.

Here they are no longer pure ideas but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. In the realm of space and time the ideas take on the burden of matter and become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of ideas clothed in matter \u2014 here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of Platonism with Aristotelean notions. The last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The return to God proceeds in the inverse order through all the steps which marked the downward course, or process of things from God. The elements become light, light becomes life, life becomes sense, sense becomes reason, reason becomes intellect, intellect becomes ideas in Christ, the Word of God, and through Christ returns to the oneness of God from which all the processes of nature began. This \"incorporation\" in Christ takes place by means of Divine grace in the Church, of which Christ is the invisible head.\n\nThus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle and end; but these three are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of our finite comprehension.

In 1681, the long-lost work was found at [[Oxford University]], and was immediately placed on the '[[Index of Forbidden Books]]', a turn of events which likely actually spurred its popularity. Despite this result, Turner noted of Eriugena that \"there can be no doubt that he himself abhorred heresy, was disposed to treat the heretic with no small degree of harshness..., and all through his life believed himself an unswervingly loyal son of the Church.\"<ref name=Turner/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''The Division of Nature'' has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which \"synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries and appears as the final achievement of ancient philosophy.\"<ref>Burch, George. ''Early Medieval Philosophy'', Kings Crown Press. 1951</ref> It is presented, like [[Alcuin]]'s book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates [[Thomas Aquinas]], who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time. Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. \"Authority is the source of knowledge\", but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged.<ref name=eriugena/>\n\n<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{catholic|title=John Scotus Eriugena}}\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=scottus-eriugena |title=John Scottus Eriugena |last=Moran |first=Dermot}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Conformal cyclic cosmology|Conformal Cyclic cosmology]]\n\n==External links==\n\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=RRb5DpHEgaoC&dq=De+divisione+naturae&source=gbs_navlinks_s Digitized Latin version on Google Books]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/eriugena-two.htm Eriugena, ''Periphyseon'' Book I: Aristotelian Logic and Categories]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-editions.htm Complete List of the Editions and Translations of the Works of Eriugena]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-biblio-one.htm Annotated bibliography on Eriugena's philosophical work ]\n*[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/eriugena.html John Scottus Eriugena: Life and Works]\n*[http://www.pims.ca/research/johannes-scottus-eriugena-periphyseon Johannes Scottus Eriugena: Periphyseon] The new critical edition by \u00c9.

Assertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always balanced in Eriugena's writings by assertions of God's transcendence above all things.\"<ref name=Moran/> \n\n''De divisione naturae'' was condemned by a [[council at Sens]] by [[Honorius III]] (1225), for promoting the identity of God and creation, and by [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]] in 1585. In 1681, the long-lost work was found at [[Oxford University]], and was immediately placed on the '[[Index of Forbidden Books]]', a turn of events which likely actually spurred its popularity. Despite this result, Turner noted of Eriugena that \"there can be no doubt that he himself abhorred heresy, was disposed to treat the heretic with no small degree of harshness..., and all through his life believed himself an unswervingly loyal son of the Church.\"<ref name=Turner/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''The Division of Nature'' has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which \"synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries and appears as the final achievement of ancient philosophy.\"<ref>Burch, George. ''Early Medieval Philosophy'', Kings Crown Press. 1951</ref> It is presented, like [[Alcuin]]'s book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates [[Thomas Aquinas]], who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time. Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. \"Authority is the source of knowledge\", but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged.<ref name=eriugena/>\n\n== See also ==\n[[Conformal cyclic cosmology|Conformal Cyclic cosmology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{catholic|title=John Scotus Eriugena}}\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=scottus-eriugena |title=John Scottus Eriugena |last=Moran |first=Dermot}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=RRb5DpHEgaoC&dq=De+divisione+naturae&source=gbs_navlinks_s Digitized Latin version on Google Books]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/eriugena-two.htm Eriugena, ''Periphyseon'' Book I: Aristotelian Logic and Categories]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-editions.htm Complete List of the Editions and Translations of the Works of Eriugena]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-biblio-one.htm Annotated bibliography on Eriugena's philosophical work ]\n*[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/eriugena.html John Scottus Eriugena: Life and Works]\n*[http://www.pims.ca/research/johannes-scottus-eriugena-periphyseon Johannes Scottus Eriugena: Periphyseon] The new critical edition by \u00c9.

Its exterior design is still based on O303, however its chassis no longer comes from O303 like its predecessor, but from O404 instead. This is shown on various new technical features, including disk brakes, independent front suspensions, and the instrument panel.\n\nThe exterior design Mercedes-Benz O350 is unusual, either in opposition to its plain predecessor O340 or its flagship O404: A tapered C-pillar makes it unmistakable. At the beginning, O350 is only available as a 12m variant with normal height (known as RHD for Reisehochdecker in German). In year 1998, a variant with increased height was presented, known as O350 SHD (Superhochdecker in German). As a result, the SHD model offers more space for luggage than conventional RHD model. \n\nIn year 1999, the Tourismo series became a facelift. The type designation \"O350\" was cancelled. The oblique C-pillar is now optically integrated into the front door, which creates a smoother transition of lines. The front, headlamps and exterior mirrors were revised, and fog lights were added. Also the interior was redesigned: Almond-shaped multifunction lights in the ceiling instead of previous light bar. These buses still come from Turkish production, and are available as RHD and SHD models.\n\nIn year 2004, Mercedes-Benz celebrated the 10th anniversary of Tourismo series: Already 10,000 units were produced since its introduction. In the same year, Mercedes-Benz also offered a special edition called \"Edition 10,000\". It is about a Tourismo RHD with special equipment and many extras, which can be recognized on its chromed stripe around the three-pointed star in the front. A total of 70 units were produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omnibusarchiv.de/include.php?path=content&mode=print&contentid=592 |title=Mercedes-Benz O340 and Mercedes-Benz O350 Tourismo |website=Omnibusarchiv |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Second generation - 2006-2018==\nThe world premiere for the 2nd generation Tourismo took place at [[International Motor Show Germany|IAA]] in year 2006. It was deliberately intended to be a low-cost alternative of its more luxurious top model, the [[Mercedes-Benz Travego|Travego]]. At first, it was available in four models: Tourismo (12.14m), Tourismo M/2 (12.96m, with 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (12.96m, with 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.93m). There are numerous safety features on this bus: the [[Electronic stability program|ESP]], [[Traction control|ASR]], and brake assist (BA). In addition, an alcohol interlock system, tyre pressure monitoring system, and fire extinguishing system in engine compartment are standard. A rear camera is optionally available, which facilitates reverse parking.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-15-RHD.xhtml?oid=9904404 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 15 RHD |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn year 2009, as the successor of [[Mercedes-Benz Integro|Integro]] range, the Tourismo RH with lowered floor was launched. In opposition to Integro, the Tourismo RH have barely optical differences: Only the side window lines in the front section of the vehicle was changed from sharp edges to smoother curves. However, the Tourismo RH model shares its most technologies and equipment options with Tourismo series, and equipped with OM470 engine meeting Euro VI standards. The doors are also offered with high panels by default, instead of full-glazed doors, which find application on Integro. According to [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], this bus is designed to both meet the requirements of interurban and touring coach uses. Two lengths are available for customers: Tourismo RH (12.14m) and Tourismo RH M (12.98m).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-16-RHM.xhtml?oid=9904354 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 16 RH/M |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTourismo K, the compact variant of Tourismo series, was introduced in year 2013. This midi touring coach is 10.32 meters long and offers seats for up to 32 passengers. It has the same height with Tourismo RH series, but its second door is located at the rear, which is advantageous for sufficient underfloor luggage room space. The onboard toilet is also at the rear, just behind the second door. The Tourismo K is equipped with an OM936 Euro VI engine, which delivers 260kW (or 354hp), and shares its equipment options with Tourismo series in general.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.auto.de/magazin/mercedes-benz-tourismo-k-kurzware-fuer-die-businessklasse/ |title=Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K: A short ware for the business class (in German) |website=Auto.de |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Tourismo-K-MA-LO-1001-Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-K.xhtml?oid=9905054 |title=Tourismo K (MA LO 1001): Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K |website=Daimler |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Third generation - 2017-present==\nThe 3rd generation tourismo experienced its world premiere in [[Brussels]] in June 2017. There is a major change on its exterior design, which resembles that of [[Mercedes-Benz Actros|Actros]], a heavy-duty truck of [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Besides that, it received a new interior design and several technological improvements. The options for interior equipment include seats, seat covers, side walls, curtains, luggage carrier shelves and central ceiling panel, which can be customized individually. Additional driving safety is guaranteed by new safety features like Emergency Brake Assist, Stop-Assist (for stop-and-go traffic e.g. [[traffic jam]]), Attention Assist, and Front Collision Guard (FCG). \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, its fuel consumption was reduced by around 4.5% due to more advanced body aerodynamics and lighter, completely redesigned body. With \"Efficiency Package\", the fuel consumption can even go down by 7%. Some new features such as Predictive Powertrain Control (PPC) or Eco Driver Feedback (EDF), can be equipped on request. Operators can select 2 cockpit variants: The Basic Plus and the Comfort Plus. They all contain a multifunction [[steering wheel]] and a instrument cluster with TFT colour screen, except that the Comfort Plus is additionally fitted with a Coach Multimedia System. \n\nThe 3rd generation Tourismo is available in four models: Tourismo (12.2m), Tourismo M/2 (13.1m, 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (13.1m, 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.9m). For the first time, they all are available either as left- or right-hand drive variants. The Tourismo K and RH series remain offered in old design.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=22530791&ls=L2VuL2luc3RhbmNlL2tvLnhodG1sP29pZD05MjY4MDAwJnJlbElkPTYwODI5JmZyb21PaWQ9OTI2ODAwMCZib3JkZXJzPXRydWUmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZ2aWV3VHlwZT1saXN0JnNvcnREZWZpbml0aW9uPVBVQkxJU0hFRF9BVC0yJnRodW1iU2NhbGVJbmRleD0wJnJvd0NvdW50c0luZGV4PTUmZnJvbUluZm9UeXBlSWQ9NDA2Mjg!&rs=6 |title=World premiere of the Mercedes-Benz Tourismo RHD: Mercedes-Benz presents the new version of Europe's most successful touring coach |website=Daimler |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mercedes-Benz Tourismo FC Karpaty Lviv.jpg|O350 Tourismo SHD 1st generation \nMercedes-Benz Tourismo (vue avant) - Trans-Alpes (Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne * \u00e9t\u00e9 2018).jpg|Tourismo RHD 1st generation facelift \nFile:Anonymous Sofia registered Bulgarian Mercedes CA 3909HA.jpg|Tourismo 2nd generation\nFile:MB Tourismo K Travelarz.jpg|Tourismo K\nFile:ABI-VT 87, Mercedes-Benz Tourismo, Vetter GmbH, Z\u00f6rbig, Germany.

Also the interior was redesigned: Almond-shaped multifunction lights in the ceiling instead of previous light bar. These buses still come from Turkish production, and are available as RHD and SHD models.\n\nIn year 2004, Mercedes-Benz celebrated the 10th anniversary of Tourismo series: Already 10,000 units were produced since its introduction. In the same year, Mercedes-Benz also offered a special edition called \"Edition 10,000\". It is about a Tourismo RHD with special equipment and many extras, which can be recognized on its chromed stripe around the three-pointed star in the front. A total of 70 units were produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omnibusarchiv.de/include.php?path=content&mode=print&contentid=592 |title=Mercedes-Benz O340 and Mercedes-Benz O350 Tourismo |website=Omnibusarchiv |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Second generation - 2006-2018==\nThe world premiere for the 2nd generation Tourismo took place at [[International Motor Show Germany|IAA]] in year 2006. It was deliberately intended to be a low-cost alternative of its more luxurious top model, the [[Mercedes-Benz Travego|Travego]]. At first, it was available in four models: Tourismo (12.14m), Tourismo M/2 (12.96m, with 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (12.96m, with 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.93m). There are numerous safety features on this bus: the [[Electronic stability program|ESP]], [[Traction control|ASR]], and brake assist (BA). In addition, an alcohol interlock system, tyre pressure monitoring system, and fire extinguishing system in engine compartment are standard. A rear camera is optionally available, which facilitates reverse parking.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-15-RHD.xhtml?oid=9904404 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 15 RHD |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn year 2009, as the successor of [[Mercedes-Benz Integro|Integro]] range, the Tourismo RH with lowered floor was launched. In opposition to Integro, the Tourismo RH have barely optical differences: Only the side window lines in the front section of the vehicle was changed from sharp edges to smoother curves. However, the Tourismo RH model shares its most technologies and equipment options with Tourismo series, and equipped with OM470 engine meeting Euro VI standards. The doors are also offered with high panels by default, instead of full-glazed doors, which find application on Integro. According to [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], this bus is designed to both meet the requirements of interurban and touring coach uses. Two lengths are available for customers: Tourismo RH (12.14m) and Tourismo RH M (12.98m).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-16-RHM.xhtml?oid=9904354 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 16 RH/M |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTourismo K, the compact variant of Tourismo series, was introduced in year 2013. This midi touring coach is 10.32 meters long and offers seats for up to 32 passengers. It has the same height with Tourismo RH series, but its second door is located at the rear, which is advantageous for sufficient underfloor luggage room space. The onboard toilet is also at the rear, just behind the second door. The Tourismo K is equipped with an OM936 Euro VI engine, which delivers 260kW (or 354hp), and shares its equipment options with Tourismo series in general.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.auto.de/magazin/mercedes-benz-tourismo-k-kurzware-fuer-die-businessklasse/ |title=Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K: A short ware for the business class (in German) |website=Auto.de |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Tourismo-K-MA-LO-1001-Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-K.xhtml?oid=9905054 |title=Tourismo K (MA LO 1001): Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K |website=Daimler |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Third generation - 2017-present==\nThe 3rd generation tourismo experienced its world premiere in [[Brussels]] in June 2017. There is a major change on its exterior design, which resembles that of [[Mercedes-Benz Actros|Actros]], a heavy-duty truck of [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Besides that, it received a new interior design and several technological improvements. The options for interior equipment include seats, seat covers, side walls, curtains, luggage carrier shelves and central ceiling panel, which can be customized individually. Additional driving safety is guaranteed by new safety features like Emergency Brake Assist, Stop-Assist (for stop-and-go traffic e.g. [[traffic jam]]), Attention Assist, and Front Collision Guard (FCG). \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, its fuel consumption was reduced by around 4.5% due to more advanced body aerodynamics and lighter, completely redesigned body. With \"Efficiency Package\", the fuel consumption can even go down by 7%. Some new features such as Predictive Powertrain Control (PPC) or Eco Driver Feedback (EDF), can be equipped on request. Operators can select 2 cockpit variants: The Basic Plus and the Comfort Plus. They all contain a multifunction [[steering wheel]] and a instrument cluster with TFT colour screen, except that the Comfort Plus is additionally fitted with a Coach Multimedia System. \n\nThe 3rd generation Tourismo is available in four models: Tourismo (12.2m), Tourismo M/2 (13.1m, 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (13.1m, 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.9m). For the first time, they all are available either as left- or right-hand drive variants. The Tourismo K and RH series remain offered in old design.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=22530791&ls=L2VuL2luc3RhbmNlL2tvLnhodG1sP29pZD05MjY4MDAwJnJlbElkPTYwODI5JmZyb21PaWQ9OTI2ODAwMCZib3JkZXJzPXRydWUmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZ2aWV3VHlwZT1saXN0JnNvcnREZWZpbml0aW9uPVBVQkxJU0hFRF9BVC0yJnRodW1iU2NhbGVJbmRleD0wJnJvd0NvdW50c0luZGV4PTUmZnJvbUluZm9UeXBlSWQ9NDA2Mjg!&rs=6 |title=World premiere of the Mercedes-Benz Tourismo RHD: Mercedes-Benz presents the new version of Europe's most successful touring coach |website=Daimler |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mercedes-Benz Tourismo FC Karpaty Lviv.jpg|O350 Tourismo SHD 1st generation \nMercedes-Benz Tourismo (vue avant) - Trans-Alpes (Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne * \u00e9t\u00e9 2018).jpg|Tourismo RHD 1st generation facelift \nFile:Anonymous Sofia registered Bulgarian Mercedes CA 3909HA.jpg|Tourismo 2nd generation\nFile:MB Tourismo K Travelarz.jpg|Tourismo K\nFile:ABI-VT 87, Mercedes-Benz Tourismo, Vetter GmbH, Z\u00f6rbig, Germany.

Red yeast rice is what is referred to as a \"koji\" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], meaning \"grain or bean overgrown with a mold culture\", a food preparation tradition going back to ca. 300 BC.<ref name=Shurtleff2012>Shurtleff W, Aoyagi A (2012).

Its use has been documented as far back as the Tang Dynasty in China in 800 AD. Red yeast rice is described in the Chinese pharmacopoeia ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica|Ben Cao Gang Mu]]'' by [[Li Shizhen]].  Recommendations were to take it internally to invigorate the body, aid in digestion, and revitalize the blood.<ref name=Erdogrul2004 /><ref name=Song2019 />\n\nA modern-era use as a dietary supplement developed in the late 1970s after researchers were isolating [[lovastatin]] from ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and monacolins from ''[[Monascus]]'', respectively, the latter being the same fungus used to make red yeast rice. Chemical analysis soon showed that [[lovastatin]] and monacolin K were identical. Different strains of ''Monascus'' fungus will produce different amounts of monacolins. The 'Went' strain of ''Monascus purpureus'' (purpureus = dark red in Latin), when properly fermented and processed, will yield a dried red yeast rice powder that is approximately 0.4% monacolins, of which roughly half will be monacolin K. The two isolations, documentations and patent applications occurred months apart.<ref name=Endo2004 /> Lovastatin became the patented, prescription drug Mevacor.<ref name=Duggan1989 /> Red yeast rice went on to become a non-prescription [[dietary supplement]] in the United States and other countries. In 1998, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) initiated action to ban a dietary supplement containing red yeast rice extract. The FDA position was that red yeast rice products that contain monacolin K are identical to a prescription drug and, thus, subject to regulation as a drug. The U.S. District Court in Utah ruled in favor of allowing the product to be sold without restriction. This decision was reversed on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2001.<ref name=Pharmanex2001 />\n\n==Production==\nRed yeast rice is produced by cultivating the mold species ''[[Monascus purpureus]]'' on rice for 3\u20136 days at room temperature.

Chemical analysis soon showed that [[lovastatin]] and monacolin K were identical. Different strains of ''Monascus'' fungus will produce different amounts of monacolins. The 'Went' strain of ''Monascus purpureus'' (purpureus = dark red in Latin), when properly fermented and processed, will yield a dried red yeast rice powder that is approximately 0.4% monacolins, of which roughly half will be monacolin K.

The FDA position was that red yeast rice products that contain monacolin K are identical to a prescription drug and, thus, subject to regulation as a drug.

'''US$''' and referred to as the '''dollar''', '''U.S. dollar''', or '''American dollar''') is the official [[currency]] of the [[United States]] and its [[territories of the United States|territories]] per the [[Coinage Act of 1792]]. One dollar is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s (symbol: \u00a2) or 1000 [[mill (currency)|mill]]s (for accounting purposes and for taxing; symbol: \u20a5). The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins: [[Dime (United States coin)|tenth dollar]], [[Half dime|one-twentieth dollar]], [[Penny (United States coin)|one-hundredth dollar]]. In addition the act created the [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]], [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter dollar]] coins. All of these coins are still minted in 2020.\n\nIn addition, several [[Series (United States currency)|forms of paper money]] were introduced by Congress over the years. The latest of these, the [[Federal Reserve Note]], was authorized by the [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]], while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQs |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12768.htm |publisher=BOARD OF GOVERNORS of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM |accessdate=3 January 2020 |date=8 October 2013 |quote=All U.S. currency remains legal tender, regardless of when it was issued.}}</ref>\nIssuance of the previous form of the currency ([[United States Note|U.S. notes]]) was discontinued in January 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legal Tender Status |url = https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/legal-tender.aspx |website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=4 Jan 2011 |quote=United States notes serve no function that is not already adequately served by Federal Reserve notes.

Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common.

The term ''[[Eagle (United States coin)|eagle]]'' was used in the [[Coinage Act of 1792]] for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\".

The German word for valley is ''thal'', or nowadays usually ''Tal'' (cognate with \"dale\" in English). St. Joachim's Valley is now known as [[J\u00e1chymov]], in the [[Czech Republic]] (then part of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]).<ref name=\"NatGeo\">National Geographic. June 2002. p. 1. ''Ask US''.</ref> Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German ''[[Thaler|Taler]]'', a word that eventually found its way into many languages, including Danish and Swedish as ''daler'', Norwegian as ''dalar'' and ''daler'', Dutch as ''daler'' or ''daalder'', Ethiopian as ''talari'', Hungarian as ''tall\u00e9r'', Italian as ''tallero'', and English as ''dollar''.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> Alternatively, ''thaler'' is said to come from the German coin ''[[Guldengroschen]]'' (\"great guilder\", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver from Joachimsthal.\n\nThe coins minted at Joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places. One such example, was a Dutch coin depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name ''[[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler]]'' (in English: \"lion dollar\").\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 [[stuiver]]s. It was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, thus it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch North American [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] (today the [[New York metropolitan area]]), and circulated throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also separately popular throughout Eastern Europe, where it led to the current Romanian and Moldovan currency being called [[Romanian leu|leu]] (literally \"lion\").\n\nAmong the English-speaking community, the Dutch coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 and is the origin of the English ''dollar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coins.lakdiva.org/netherlands/1644_wes_lion_daalder_ag.html |title=Dutch Colonial&nbsp;\u2013 Lion Dollar |publisher=Coins.lakdiva.org |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The modern American-English pronunciation of ''dollar'' is still remarkably close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of ''daler''.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dollar |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy analogy with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos&nbsp;\u2013 with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 came to be known as ''Spanish'' dollars.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\"/> By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been replaced by the [[Spanish dollar]], the famous \"piece of eight\", which was distributed widely in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the New World]] and in the [[Philippines]].<ref name = \"nqteor\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Julian\n  | first =R.W.\n  | title =All About the Dollar\n  | publisher =Numismatist\n  | year = 2007\n  | page =41 }}</ref>\nEventually, dollar became the name of the official American currency.\n\n===Nicknames===\n{{see also|Slang terms for money#United States}}\nThe [[colloquialism]] \"''[[Wikt:buck|buck]]''\"(s) (much like the British word \"''[[pound sterling|quid]]''\"(s, pl) for the pound sterling) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar.

The suffix \"''K''\" or \"''k''\" (from \"[[kilo-]]\") is also commonly used to denote this amount (such as \"$10k\" to mean $10,000). However, the $1,000 note is no longer in general use. A \"''large''\" or \"''stack''\", it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as \"''fifty large''\" meaning $50,000). The $100 note is nicknamed \"''Benjamin''\", \"''Benji''\", \"''Ben''\", or \"''Franklin''\" (after [[Benjamin Franklin]]), \"''C-note''\" (C being the [[Roman numeral]] for 100), \"''Century note''\" or \"''bill''\" (e.g. \"''two bills''\" being $200). The $50 note is occasionally called a \"''yardstick''\" or a \"''grant''\" (after President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], pictured on the obverse). The $20 note is referred to as a \"''double sawbuck''\", \"''Jackson''\" (after [[Andrew Jackson]]), or \"double eagle\". The $10 note is referred to as a \"''sawbuck''\", \"''ten-spot''\" or \"''Hamilton''\" (after [[Alexander Hamilton]]). The $5 note as \"''Lincoln''\", \"''fin''\", \"''fiver''\" or \"''five-spot''\". The infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called \"''deuce''\", \"''Tom''\", or \"''Jefferson''\" (after [[Thomas Jefferson]]). The $1 note as a \"''single''\" or \"''buck''\". The dollar has also been referred to as a \"''bone''\" and \"''bones''\" in plural (e.g. \"''twenty bones''\" is equal to $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse (rather than in cameo insets), upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as \"''bigface''\" notes or \"[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] money\".\n\n\"''[[Piastre]]''\" was the original French word for the U.S. dollar, used for example in the French text of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of [[Cajun French]] and [[New England French]]. Modern French uses ''dollar'' for this unit of currency as well. The term is still used as slang for U.S. dollars in the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French-speaking Caribbean]] islands, most notably [[Haiti]].\n\n==Dollar sign==\n{{Main|Dollar sign}}\n\n[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Spanish real|Spanish silver ''real]]'' or [[peso]] of 1768]]\n\nThe symbol '''$''', usually written before the numerical amount, is used for the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies).

The first dollar coins issued by the [[United States Mint]] (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar, minted in Mexico and Peru. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and later, Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]]. The coinage of various English colonies also circulated. The [[lion dollar]] was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes referred to as \"dog dollars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=The Lion Dollar: Introduction |publisher=Coins.nd.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the 6th of July 1785, the [[Continental Congress]] resolved that the money unit of the United States, the dollar, would contain 375.64 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of fine silver; on the 8th of August 1786, the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account, corresponding with the division of coins, would proceed in a [[Decimalisation|decimal ratio]], with the sub-units being mills at 0.001 of a dollar, cents at 0.010 of a dollar, and dimes at 0.100 of a dollar.<ref name=\"contcongress1\"/>\n\nAfter the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]], the U.S. dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of 1792, which specified a \"dollar\" to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or {{convert|416|gr}} of standard silver and an \"eagle\" to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or {{convert|270|gr}} of gold (again depending on purity).<ref>{{cite web|last=Mint|first=U.S.|title=Coinage Act of 1792|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historical-documents/coinage-act-of-april-2-1792|publisher=U.S. treasury}}</ref> The choice of the value 371 grains arose from [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar.\n\nThe same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and the dollar at {{frac|10}} eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, {{frac|10}}, and {{frac|20}} dollars; it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, and {{frac|10}} eagles. The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.<ref>See [https://www.ecominoes.com/2013/01/the-definitive-inflation-chart.html].</ref>\n\nThe early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD|title=United States Dollar|publisher=OANDA|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5114|title=Engraving and printing currency and security documents:Article b|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=December 19, 2013}}</ref> In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28312/money-everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-coin-portraits|title=On the Money: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Coin Portraits|author=Matt Soniak|magazine=Mental Floss|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that \"heads\" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans.

Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the [[War of 1812]]. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase \"not worth a continental\". This was a primary reason for the \"No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\" clause in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|article 1, section 10]] of the United States Constitution.\n\nIn order to finance the [[War of 1812]], Congress authorized the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)|Treasury Note]]s, interest-bearing short-term debt that could be used to pay public dues. While they were intended to serve as debt, they did function \"to a limited extent\" as money. Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the [[Panic of 1837]] and the [[Panic of 1857]], as well as to help finance the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nIn addition to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50 million in the form of [[Demand Notes]], which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Cases|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], issuing [[United States Notes]], which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were [[legal tender]], meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through [[Gresham's Law]]. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in [[Hepburn v. Griswold]] that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the [[Legal Tender Cases]]. In 1875, Congress passed the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]], requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes to be redeemed for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.\n\nThe [[Gold Standard Act]] of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as {{convert|23.22|gr}} of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 [[troy ounce]] of gold at $20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by [[Executive Order 6102]] issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to {{convert|13.71|gr}}, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place, eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the [[Nixon Shock]]. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} before the U.S. dollar was allowed to freely float on [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]].\n\nAccording to the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.\n\n==Coins==\n{{Main|Coins of the United States dollar}}\n\nOfficial United States coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#2E8B57;\"\n!

From 1965 to 1970 the [[Kennedy half dollar]] was the only ''circulating'' coin with any silver content, which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel. However, since 1992, the U.S. Mint has produced special Silver Proof Sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions.\nIn addition, an experimental [[Stella (United States coin)|$4.00 (Stella)]] coin was also minted in 1879, but never placed into circulation, and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination.\n\nThe $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)]] celebrating the opening of the [[Panama Canal]]. Only 1,128 were made, 645 of which were octagonal; this remains the only U.S. coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest U.S. coin ever produced.\n\nA $100 gold coin was produced in High relief during 2015, although it was primarily produced for collectors, not for general circulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinnews.net/2015/07/31/2015-100-american-liberty-high-relief-gold-coin-photos/|title=2015 $100 American Liberty High Relief Gold Coin Photos|date=July 31, 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1934 to present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar and dollar.

''Silver Proofs'' tend to be the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver. Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where the four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Presidential dollars (along with all other dollar coin series) minted from 2012 onward were made solely for collectors.<ref>{{cite web|title=The United States Mint Coins and Medals Program|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coin-and-medal-programs|publisher=Department of the Treasury|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* 2007 had [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[James Madison]]\n* 2008 had [[James Monroe]], [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Martin Van Buren]]\n* 2009 had [[William Henry Harrison]], [[John Tyler]], [[James K.

Written by Gordon T. Anderson. Published April 25, 2005.</ref> [[United States dollar coin|Silver dollars]] were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The [[Susan B. Anthony]] [[Susan B. Anthony dollar|dollar]] coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain [[legal tender]]. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a [[Sacagawea dollar|new dollar coin]] featuring [[Sacagawea]] was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing dollar bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02896.pdf |title=Report to the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate |publisher=USGAO |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2007, the [[U.S. Mint]], under the [[Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]],<ref>Pub. L. No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664 (December 22, 2005).</ref> introduced a new $1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin. Based on the success of the \"[[50 State Quarters]]\" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with [[George Washington]], on the obverse side. The reverse side features the [[Statue of Liberty]]. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of \"[[E Pluribus Unum]]\", \"[[In God We Trust]]\", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the [[One pound (British decimal coin)|British \u00a31]] coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription \"Liberty\" has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]/[[Penny (United States coin)|penny]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]/[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]/[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[George Washington|Washington]]/[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]/[[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]/[[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]]). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is [[Grover Cleveland]] will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/20120619-united-states-mint-releases-2012-presidential-1-fourcoin-set-on-june-26 |title=United States Mint Releases 2012 Presidential $1 Four\u2013Coin Set on June 26 |publisher=Usmint.com |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly releases of the Washington coin included [[error coins]] shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \"heads\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \"upside down lettering error\" coins.<ref>[http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/G/GODLESS_DOLLARS Godless Dollars]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most [[vending machines]] are incapable of making change in [[banknotes]], they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Mint marks===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Mint\n!Mint mark\n!Metal minted\n!Year established\n!Current status\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Denver Mint|Denver]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| D\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| All metals\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| 1906\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| Facility open\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| P ''or'' ''none''{{refn| group = lower-alpha | The letter \"P\" is used for the Philadelphia mint mark on all coins (except cents) released from 1980 onward.

The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.\n\nCurrently printed denominations are [[United States one-dollar bill|$1]], [[United States two-dollar bill|$2]], [[United States five-dollar bill|$5]], [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10]], [[United States twenty-dollar bill|$20]], [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50]], and [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100]]. Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by [[organized crime]]; it was the latter usage that prompted President [[Richard Nixon]] to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see [[large denomination bills in U.S. currency]] for details. With the exception of the $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.\n\nThough still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the [[American Council of the Blind]], the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill. It also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences, and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period.<ref>See [[Federal Reserve Note]] for details and references</ref>\n\n==Means of issue==\n\nThe monetary base consists of coins and Federal Reserve Notes in circulation outside the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury, plus deposits held by depository institutions at Federal Reserve Banks.

This money is not transferred from any existing funds\u2014it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new [[high-powered money]]. Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U.S. Treasury Department.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets: Currency & Coins |publisher=United States Department of the Treasury |url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/edu_fact-sheets_currency_index.aspx |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref> The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to print new [[Federal Reserve notes|dollar bills]]) and the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).\n\nUsually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the [[federal funds rate]], the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) [[Discount window]] lending (as [[lender of last resort]]); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) \"[[Open mouth operations]]\" (talking monetary policy with the market).\n\n==Value==\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"{{float right}}\"\n|+ Buying power of one U.S. dollar compared to 1775 [[Continental Currency|Continental currency]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1775||&nbsp;$1.00\n|-\n|1780||&nbsp;$0.59\n|-\n|1790||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1800||&nbsp;$0.64\n|-\n|1810||&nbsp;$0.66\n|-\n|1820||&nbsp;$0.69\n|-\n|1830||&nbsp;$0.88\n|-\n|1840||&nbsp;$0.94\n|-\n|1850||&nbsp;$1.03\n|-\n|1860||&nbsp;$0.97\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1870||&nbsp;$0.62\n|-\n|1880||&nbsp;$0.79\n|-\n|1890||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1900||&nbsp;$0.96\n|-\n|1910||&nbsp;$0.85\n|-\n|1920||&nbsp;$0.39\n|-\n|1930||&nbsp;$0.47\n|-\n|1940||&nbsp;$0.56\n|-\n|1950||&nbsp;$0.33\n|-\n|1960||&nbsp;$0.26\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1970||&nbsp;$0.20\n|-\n|1980||&nbsp;$0.10\n|-\n|1990||&nbsp;$0.06\n|-\n|2000||&nbsp;$0.05\n|-\n|2007||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2008||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2009||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2010||&nbsp;$0.035\n|-\n|2011||&nbsp;$0.034\n|-\n|2012||&nbsp;$0.03\n|}\n|}\n\n[[File:US Consumer Price Index Graph.svg|thumb|upright=2.1|U.S. Consumer Price Index, starting from 1913]]\n\nThe 6th paragraph of [[Coinage clause|Section 8]] of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to \"coin money\" and to \"regulate the value\" of domestic and foreign coins.

'''US$''' and referred to as the '''dollar''', '''U.S. dollar''', or '''American dollar''') is the official [[currency]] of the [[United States]] and its [[territories of the United States|territories]] per the [[Coinage Act of 1792]]. One dollar is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s (symbol: \u00a2) or 1000 [[mill (currency)|mill]]s (for accounting purposes and for taxing; symbol: \u20a5). The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins: [[Dime (United States coin)|tenth dollar]], [[Half dime|one-twentieth dollar]], [[Penny (United States coin)|one-hundredth dollar]]. In addition the act created the [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]], [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter dollar]] coins. All of these coins are still minted in 2020.\n\nIn addition, several [[Series (United States currency)|forms of paper money]] were introduced by Congress over the years. The latest of these, the [[Federal Reserve Note]], was authorized by the [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]], while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQs |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12768.htm |publisher=BOARD OF GOVERNORS of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM |accessdate=3 January 2020 |date=8 October 2013 |quote=All U.S. currency remains legal tender, regardless of when it was issued.}}</ref>\nIssuance of the previous form of the currency ([[United States Note|U.S. notes]]) was discontinued in January 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legal Tender Status |url = https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/legal-tender.aspx |website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=4 Jan 2011 |quote=United States notes serve no function that is not already adequately served by Federal Reserve notes.

The German word for valley is ''thal'', or nowadays usually ''Tal'' (cognate with \"dale\" in English). St. Joachim's Valley is now known as [[J\u00e1chymov]], in the [[Czech Republic]] (then part of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]).<ref name=\"NatGeo\">National Geographic. June 2002. p. 1. ''Ask US''.</ref> Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German ''[[Thaler|Taler]]'', a word that eventually found its way into many languages, including Danish and Swedish as ''daler'', Norwegian as ''dalar'' and ''daler'', Dutch as ''daler'' or ''daalder'', Ethiopian as ''talari'', Hungarian as ''tall\u00e9r'', Italian as ''tallero'', and English as ''dollar''.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> Alternatively, ''thaler'' is said to come from the German coin ''[[Guldengroschen]]'' (\"great guilder\", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver from Joachimsthal.\n\nThe coins minted at Joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places. One such example, was a Dutch coin depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name ''[[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler]]'' (in English: \"lion dollar\").\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 [[stuiver]]s. It was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, thus it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.\n\nThe ''leeuwendaler'' was popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch North American [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] (today the [[New York metropolitan area]]), and circulated throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also separately popular throughout Eastern Europe, where it led to the current Romanian and Moldovan currency being called [[Romanian leu|leu]] (literally \"lion\").\n\nAmong the English-speaking community, the Dutch coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 and is the origin of the English ''dollar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coins.lakdiva.org/netherlands/1644_wes_lion_daalder_ag.html |title=Dutch Colonial&nbsp;\u2013 Lion Dollar |publisher=Coins.lakdiva.org |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The modern American-English pronunciation of ''dollar'' is still remarkably close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of ''daler''.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dollar |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy analogy with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos&nbsp;\u2013 with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar&nbsp;\u2013 came to be known as ''Spanish'' dollars.<ref name=\"etymologiebank.nl\"/> By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been replaced by the [[Spanish dollar]], the famous \"piece of eight\", which was distributed widely in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the New World]] and in the [[Philippines]].<ref name = \"nqteor\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Julian\n  | first =R.W.\n  | title =All About the Dollar\n  | publisher =Numismatist\n  | year = 2007\n  | page =41 }}</ref>\nEventually, dollar became the name of the official American currency.\n\n===Nicknames===\n{{see also|Slang terms for money#United States}}\nThe [[colloquialism]] \"''[[Wikt:buck|buck]]''\"(s) (much like the British word \"''[[pound sterling|quid]]''\"(s, pl) for the pound sterling) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar.

The suffix \"''K''\" or \"''k''\" (from \"[[kilo-]]\") is also commonly used to denote this amount (such as \"$10k\" to mean $10,000). However, the $1,000 note is no longer in general use. A \"''large''\" or \"''stack''\", it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as \"''fifty large''\" meaning $50,000). The $100 note is nicknamed \"''Benjamin''\", \"''Benji''\", \"''Ben''\", or \"''Franklin''\" (after [[Benjamin Franklin]]), \"''C-note''\" (C being the [[Roman numeral]] for 100), \"''Century note''\" or \"''bill''\" (e.g. \"''two bills''\" being $200). The $50 note is occasionally called a \"''yardstick''\" or a \"''grant''\" (after President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], pictured on the obverse). The $20 note is referred to as a \"''double sawbuck''\", \"''Jackson''\" (after [[Andrew Jackson]]), or \"double eagle\". The $10 note is referred to as a \"''sawbuck''\", \"''ten-spot''\" or \"''Hamilton''\" (after [[Alexander Hamilton]]). The $5 note as \"''Lincoln''\", \"''fin''\", \"''fiver''\" or \"''five-spot''\". The infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called \"''deuce''\", \"''Tom''\", or \"''Jefferson''\" (after [[Thomas Jefferson]]). The $1 note as a \"''single''\" or \"''buck''\". The dollar has also been referred to as a \"''bone''\" and \"''bones''\" in plural (e.g. \"''twenty bones''\" is equal to $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse (rather than in cameo insets), upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as \"''bigface''\" notes or \"[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] money\".\n\n\"''[[Piastre]]''\" was the original French word for the U.S. dollar, used for example in the French text of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of [[Cajun French]] and [[New England French]]. Modern French uses ''dollar'' for this unit of currency as well. The term is still used as slang for U.S. dollars in the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French-speaking Caribbean]] islands, most notably [[Haiti]].\n\n==Dollar sign==\n{{Main|Dollar sign}}\n\n[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Spanish real|Spanish silver ''real]]'' or [[peso]] of 1768]]\n\nThe symbol '''$''', usually written before the numerical amount, is used for the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies).

The first dollar coins issued by the [[United States Mint]] (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar, minted in Mexico and Peru. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and later, Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]]. The coinage of various English colonies also circulated. The [[lion dollar]] was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes referred to as \"dog dollars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=The Lion Dollar: Introduction |publisher=Coins.nd.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the 6th of July 1785, the [[Continental Congress]] resolved that the money unit of the United States, the dollar, would contain 375.64 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of fine silver; on the 8th of August 1786, the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account, corresponding with the division of coins, would proceed in a [[Decimalisation|decimal ratio]], with the sub-units being mills at 0.001 of a dollar, cents at 0.010 of a dollar, and dimes at 0.100 of a dollar.<ref name=\"contcongress1\"/>\n\nAfter the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]], the U.S. dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of 1792, which specified a \"dollar\" to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or {{convert|416|gr}} of standard silver and an \"eagle\" to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or {{convert|270|gr}} of gold (again depending on purity).<ref>{{cite web|last=Mint|first=U.S.|title=Coinage Act of 1792|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historical-documents/coinage-act-of-april-2-1792|publisher=U.S. treasury}}</ref> The choice of the value 371 grains arose from [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar.\n\nThe same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and the dollar at {{frac|10}} eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, {{frac|10}}, and {{frac|20}} dollars; it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, and {{frac|10}} eagles. The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.<ref>See [https://www.ecominoes.com/2013/01/the-definitive-inflation-chart.html].</ref>\n\nThe early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD|title=United States Dollar|publisher=OANDA|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5114|title=Engraving and printing currency and security documents:Article b|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=December 19, 2013}}</ref> In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28312/money-everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-coin-portraits|title=On the Money: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Coin Portraits|author=Matt Soniak|magazine=Mental Floss|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that \"heads\" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans.

The [[Continental Congress]] also began issuing \"Continental Currency\" denominated in Spanish dollars. The dollar was valued relative to the states' currencies at the following rates:\n* 5 shillings \u2013 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n* 6 shillings \u2013 [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Virginia]]\n* {{frac|7|1|2}} shillings \u2013 [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]]\n* 8 shillings \u2013 New York, [[North Carolina]]\n* {{frac|32|1|2}} shillings \u2013 [[South Carolina]]\n\nContinental currency [[depreciation (currency)|depreciated]] badly during the war, giving rise to the famous phrase \"not worth a continental\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Eric P.|title=The Early Paper Money of America|date=1990|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87341-120-X|page=17|edition=3}}</ref> A primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between Congress and the states, which continued to issue bills of credit.

The gold coins that were minted were not given any denomination and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the [[gold standard]] to {{convert|23.2|gr}}, followed by a slight adjustment to {{convert|23.22|gr}} in 1837 (16:1 ratio).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals, due to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the [[War of 1812]]. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase \"not worth a continental\". This was a primary reason for the \"No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\" clause in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|article 1, section 10]] of the United States Constitution.\n\nIn order to finance the [[War of 1812]], Congress authorized the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)|Treasury Note]]s, interest-bearing short-term debt that could be used to pay public dues. While they were intended to serve as debt, they did function \"to a limited extent\" as money. Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the [[Panic of 1837]] and the [[Panic of 1857]], as well as to help finance the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nIn addition to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50 million in the form of [[Demand Notes]], which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Cases|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], issuing [[United States Notes]], which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were [[legal tender]], meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through [[Gresham's Law]]. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in [[Hepburn v. Griswold]] that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the [[Legal Tender Cases]]. In 1875, Congress passed the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]], requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes to be redeemed for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.\n\nThe [[Gold Standard Act]] of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as {{convert|23.22|gr}} of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 [[troy ounce]] of gold at $20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by [[Executive Order 6102]] issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to {{convert|13.71|gr}}, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place, eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the [[Nixon Shock]]. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} before the U.S. dollar was allowed to freely float on [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]].\n\nAccording to the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.\n\n==Coins==\n{{Main|Coins of the United States dollar}}\n\nOfficial United States coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#2E8B57;\"\n!

However, since 1992, the U.S. Mint has produced special Silver Proof Sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions.\nIn addition, an experimental [[Stella (United States coin)|$4.00 (Stella)]] coin was also minted in 1879, but never placed into circulation, and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination.\n\nThe $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)]] celebrating the opening of the [[Panama Canal]]. Only 1,128 were made, 645 of which were octagonal; this remains the only U.S. coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest U.S. coin ever produced.\n\nA $100 gold coin was produced in High relief during 2015, although it was primarily produced for collectors, not for general circulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinnews.net/2015/07/31/2015-100-american-liberty-high-relief-gold-coin-photos/|title=2015 $100 American Liberty High Relief Gold Coin Photos|date=July 31, 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1934 to present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar and dollar.

Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where the four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.

Written by Gordon T. Anderson. Published April 25, 2005.</ref> [[United States dollar coin|Silver dollars]] were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The [[Susan B. Anthony]] [[Susan B. Anthony dollar|dollar]] coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain [[legal tender]]. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a [[Sacagawea dollar|new dollar coin]] featuring [[Sacagawea]] was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing dollar bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02896.pdf |title=Report to the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate |publisher=USGAO |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2007, the [[U.S. Mint]], under the [[Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]],<ref>Pub. L. No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664 (December 22, 2005).</ref> introduced a new $1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin. Based on the success of the \"[[50 State Quarters]]\" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with [[George Washington]], on the obverse side. The reverse side features the [[Statue of Liberty]]. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of \"[[E Pluribus Unum]]\", \"[[In God We Trust]]\", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the [[One pound (British decimal coin)|British \u00a31]] coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription \"Liberty\" has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]/[[Penny (United States coin)|penny]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]/[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]/[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[George Washington|Washington]]/[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]/[[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]/[[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]]). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is [[Grover Cleveland]] will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/20120619-united-states-mint-releases-2012-presidential-1-fourcoin-set-on-june-26 |title=United States Mint Releases 2012 Presidential $1 Four\u2013Coin Set on June 26 |publisher=Usmint.com |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly releases of the Washington coin included [[error coins]] shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \"heads\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \"upside down lettering error\" coins.<ref>[http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/G/GODLESS_DOLLARS Godless Dollars]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most [[vending machines]] are incapable of making change in [[banknotes]], they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Mint marks===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Mint\n!Mint mark\n!Metal minted\n!Year established\n!Current status\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Denver Mint|Denver]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| D\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| All metals\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| 1906\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| Facility open\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]]\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| P ''or'' ''none''{{refn| group = lower-alpha | The letter \"P\" is used for the Philadelphia mint mark on all coins (except cents) released from 1980 onward.

Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by [[organized crime]]; it was the latter usage that prompted President [[Richard Nixon]] to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see [[large denomination bills in U.S. currency]] for details. With the exception of the $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.\n\nThough still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the [[American Council of the Blind]], the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill.

This money is not transferred from any existing funds\u2014it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new [[high-powered money]]. Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U.S. Treasury Department.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets: Currency & Coins |publisher=United States Department of the Treasury |url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/edu_fact-sheets_currency_index.aspx |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref> The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to print new [[Federal Reserve notes|dollar bills]]) and the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).\n\nUsually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the [[federal funds rate]], the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) [[Discount window]] lending (as [[lender of last resort]]); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) \"[[Open mouth operations]]\" (talking monetary policy with the market).\n\n==Value==\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"{{float right}}\"\n|+ Buying power of one U.S. dollar compared to 1775 [[Continental Currency|Continental currency]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1775||&nbsp;$1.00\n|-\n|1780||&nbsp;$0.59\n|-\n|1790||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1800||&nbsp;$0.64\n|-\n|1810||&nbsp;$0.66\n|-\n|1820||&nbsp;$0.69\n|-\n|1830||&nbsp;$0.88\n|-\n|1840||&nbsp;$0.94\n|-\n|1850||&nbsp;$1.03\n|-\n|1860||&nbsp;$0.97\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1870||&nbsp;$0.62\n|-\n|1880||&nbsp;$0.79\n|-\n|1890||&nbsp;$0.89\n|-\n|1900||&nbsp;$0.96\n|-\n|1910||&nbsp;$0.85\n|-\n|1920||&nbsp;$0.39\n|-\n|1930||&nbsp;$0.47\n|-\n|1940||&nbsp;$0.56\n|-\n|1950||&nbsp;$0.33\n|-\n|1960||&nbsp;$0.26\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n!style=\"width: 40pt; font-size: 95%;\"|&nbsp;Equivalent&nbsp; buying power\n|-\n|1970||&nbsp;$0.20\n|-\n|1980||&nbsp;$0.10\n|-\n|1990||&nbsp;$0.06\n|-\n|2000||&nbsp;$0.05\n|-\n|2007||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2008||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2009||&nbsp;$0.04\n|-\n|2010||&nbsp;$0.035\n|-\n|2011||&nbsp;$0.034\n|-\n|2012||&nbsp;$0.03\n|}\n|}\n\n[[File:US Consumer Price Index Graph.svg|thumb|upright=2.1|U.S. Consumer Price Index, starting from 1913]]\n\nThe 6th paragraph of [[Coinage clause|Section 8]] of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to \"coin money\" and to \"regulate the value\" of domestic and foreign coins.

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May) German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], then attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish Guards at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} The defence of Boulogne was assisted by about eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and at dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy demolition party. During a lull in the afternoon, a ''Luftwaffe'' force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the delays in allowing an advance and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May and Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''C\u00f4te d'Opale''}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley between hills. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town (''Haute Ville'' or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]'' (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the panzers achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne, without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a ''Luftwaffe'' air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]], which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}} To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=53}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the ''Haute Ville'' (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port, Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation.

Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was divided into two columns, one of which was to circle round the town and attack from the north. The other column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, when it encountered the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who had arrived between the Germans and Boulogne. The small French force, including clerks, drivers and signallers, set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The same column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne that evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions in the south of the town. The Irish Guards knocked out the leading German tank and beat off subsequent attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours of the morning, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were driven back by the Guardsmen on each occasion.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} General Brownrigg, who was Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his headquarters staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer [[HMS Verity|HMS ''Verity'']], without informing the Guards. Only some of the 21st Division's troops were able to deploy to its intended blocking positions near Desvres before the German advance reached them. The French troops managed to delay the 1st Panzer Division here for much of the 22nd before Fox-Pitt was told at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} that the French had fallen back to Boulogne from their blocking position after being forced back by the German tanks.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} The majority of the French division, however, were still en route to Boulogne by train when they were ambushed by German tanks and dispersed before reaching the town.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy and French destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} The commanders of the 2nd Panzer Division found that the British and French in Boulogne were \"fighting tenaciously for every inch of ground\" to such an extent that they could not tell if the British were evacuating or reinforcing the town.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]}} dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking many of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and the remainder of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and ''Vimiera'' was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} The quayside was deserted but the captain called out by [[loud hailer]] and found that many men were in hiding and packed then into every available space. When ''Vimiera'' arrived at Dover at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} {{nowrap|1,400 men}} disembarked (including [[Arnold Ridley]]).{{sfn|Gardner|2000|pp=8\u201310}} Most of the British troops had been evacuated but about {{nowrap|300 Welsh}} Guards remained in the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=155}} Lack of radio communication left three of the Welsh Guards forward companies out of contact and by the time they had been informed of the evacuation, two companies had been cut off from the docks; both companies split into groups and attempted a break-out to the north-east.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the {{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division.

The French Navy continued its fire support but the destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Chacal||2}} were damaged by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} and ''Chacal'' was later sunk by German artillery. During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\nThe final remaining British unit in Boulogne was No. 3 Company, Welsh Guards under the command of Major Windsor Lewis.

Besides guardsmen from both battalions, there were also {{nowrap|120 French}} infantry, {{nowrap|200 AMPC,}} {{nowrap|120 Royal}} Engineers and {{nowrap|150 civilian}} refugees; most of the Pioneers were unarmed. When the sheds came under German fire, Lewis moved the group into the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} (harbour railway station) and made [[sandbag]] barricades. On the evening of 24 May, under fire from tanks and machine-guns, they repulsed a German assault party that had approached the quay in a boat. Without food, running low on ammunition and realising that there would be no further evacuation, the force surrendered at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} on 25 May.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} The Germans captured {{nowrap|5,000 Allied}} troops in Boulogne, the majority of whom were French.{{sfn|Rickard|2008|nopp=y}} Many of the prisoners were put to work repairing the harbour fortifications to resist a British amphibious assault.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+<small>'''Approximate number of troops evacuated, 23\u201324 May 1940'''</small>{{sfn|Gardner|2000|p=10}}\n|-\n!

The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In 1954, [[Stephen Roskill]], wrote that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May) German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], then attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish Guards at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} The defence of Boulogne was assisted by about eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and at dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy demolition party. During a lull in the afternoon, a ''Luftwaffe'' force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the delays in allowing an advance and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May and Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''C\u00f4te d'Opale''}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley between hills. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town (''Haute Ville'' or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]'' (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the panzers achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne, without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a ''Luftwaffe'' air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]], which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}} To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=53}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the ''Haute Ville'' (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port, Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic, until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued, until the order was questioned and Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and then visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}} Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nIn response to General Brownrigg's requests for reinforcements, a detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Meanwhile, part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]], consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], were training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when they were ordered to embark for France.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=147}} Together with the Brigade Anti-Tank Company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], they arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May, aboard three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Vimy|HMS ''Vimy'']], having been escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=147-148}} The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with General Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards held the left flank north-east of the river, on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=148}} Some road blocks had already been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft personnel held the right of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh Guards' left flank and the coast, allocated to the reinforcements which were expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and incompletely-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}} Lanquetot had told Fox-Pitt that the French forces in Boulogne were \"folded up\" which Fox-Pitt interpreted to mean were ready to give up.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XXXXI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was divided into two columns, one of which was to circle round the town and attack from the north. The other column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, when it encountered the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who had arrived between the Germans and Boulogne. The small French force, including clerks, drivers and signallers, set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The same column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne that evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions in the south of the town. The Irish Guards knocked out the leading German tank and beat off subsequent attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours of the morning, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were driven back by the Guardsmen on each occasion.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} General Brownrigg, who was Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his headquarters staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer [[HMS Verity|HMS ''Verity'']], without informing the Guards. Only some of the 21st Division's troops were able to deploy to its intended blocking positions near Desvres before the German advance reached them. The French troops managed to delay the 1st Panzer Division here for much of the 22nd before Fox-Pitt was told at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} that the French had fallen back to Boulogne from their blocking position after being forced back by the German tanks.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} The majority of the French division, however, were still en route to Boulogne by train when they were ambushed by German tanks and dispersed before reaching the town.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy and French destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} The commanders of the 2nd Panzer Division found that the British and French in Boulogne were \"fighting tenaciously for every inch of ground\" to such an extent that they could not tell if the British were evacuating or reinforcing the town.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]}} dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking many of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and the remainder of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and ''Vimiera'' was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} The quayside was deserted but the captain called out by [[loud hailer]] and found that many men were in hiding and packed then into every available space. When ''Vimiera'' arrived at Dover at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} {{nowrap|1,400 men}} disembarked (including [[Arnold Ridley]]).{{sfn|Gardner|2000|pp=8\u201310}} Most of the British troops had been evacuated but about {{nowrap|300 Welsh}} Guards remained in the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=155}} Lack of radio communication left three of the Welsh Guards forward companies out of contact and by the time they had been informed of the evacuation, two companies had been cut off from the docks; both companies split into groups and attempted a break-out to the north-east.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the {{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division. When he discovered that disaster had befallen his division, he organised the defence of the town as best he could.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} By the time that Brigadier Fox-Pitt had received orders to evacuate, there were no means of communication with Lanquetot who could not be informed of the British retreat.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne-sur-Mer - Porte Gayolle.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A gate in the medieval town walls, defended by parties of the 21st Infantry Division}}]]\nOn the evening of 24 May, the Germans attacked the town at {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} and {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} The attacks were repulsed and some German tanks were reported to have been destroyed. The French Navy continued its fire support but the destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Chacal||2}} were damaged by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} and ''Chacal'' was later sunk by German artillery. During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\nThe final remaining British unit in Boulogne was No. 3 Company, Welsh Guards under the command of Major Windsor Lewis. No. 3 Company did not arrive at the docks till daybreak, after the departure of ''Vimiera''.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=155}} Lewis also took under his command a large party of stragglers, who were awaiting rescue in the sheds at the quayside. Besides guardsmen from both battalions, there were also {{nowrap|120 French}} infantry, {{nowrap|200 AMPC,}} {{nowrap|120 Royal}} Engineers and {{nowrap|150 civilian}} refugees; most of the Pioneers were unarmed. When the sheds came under German fire, Lewis moved the group into the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} (harbour railway station) and made [[sandbag]] barricades. On the evening of 24 May, under fire from tanks and machine-guns, they repulsed a German assault party that had approached the quay in a boat. Without food, running low on ammunition and realising that there would be no further evacuation, the force surrendered at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} on 25 May.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} The Germans captured {{nowrap|5,000 Allied}} troops in Boulogne, the majority of whom were French.{{sfn|Rickard|2008|nopp=y}} Many of the prisoners were put to work repairing the harbour fortifications to resist a British amphibious assault.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+<small>'''Approximate number of troops evacuated, 23\u201324 May 1940'''</small>{{sfn|Gardner|2000|p=10}}\n|-\n!

On the morning of 24 May, Lanquetot discovered that the British had gone and there were French complaints about British \"desertion\".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=70}} To the British the Guards had been sent to Boulogne at short notice to hold a BEF entrep\u00f4t; when Boulogne became redundant the two battalions, which could not hold the town, were withdrawn.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=155}}\n\nAllegations that the British had deserted the French may have influenced Churchill to order the garrison at Calais to fight to the finish during the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|siege]].{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=198}}{{efn|In ''Their Finest Hour'' (1949), Churchill wrote that he \"regretted the evacuation\" of Boulogne.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=70, 72}}}} The decision was controversial as the British at Calais could have been evacuated, after they had slowed the German advance towards Dunkirk.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=173}} In the army volume of the British Official History, [[Lionel Ellis]] wrote that the five-hour delay of the XIX Corps attack on Boulogne until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, which had been ordered by General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe von Kleist}}, had been criticised in the Corps war diary. The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In 1954, [[Stephen Roskill]], wrote that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.
