It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped [[Bristol Channel]] and [[Severn Estuary]] and the surging water forces its way upstream in a series of waves, as far as [[Gloucester]] and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two [[weir]]s, and sometimes one in [[Tewkesbury]], before finally petering out.\n\nBores are present on about 130 days in the year, concentrated on the days immediately following the [[New moon|new]] and [[full moon]]. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on such things as the time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]], which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.\n\n== Formation ==\nThe [[Severn Estuary]], which empties into the [[Bristol Channel]], has one of the largest [[tidal range]]s in the world&nbsp;\u2013 about {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/severnpositionmay2006_1508223.pd | format= PDF | work= UK Environment Agency | title= Severn Estuary Barrage | date= 31 May 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2016 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155720/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/severnpositionmay2006_1508223.pd <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2005/07/04/bristolchannel_feature.shtml | title= Coast: Bristol Channel | work= BBC | accessdate= 27 August 2007 }}</ref> It is exceeded only by the [[Bay of Fundy]], and possibly [[Ungava Bay]], both in Canada.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Charles T. |last2=Solvason |first2=Ron |last3=Solomon |first3=Christian |editor1-first=J.

It moves towards the continent of Europe at about {{convert|700|miles wide|km|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. When it reaches the continental shelf, its width decreases to about {{convert|200|miles wide/km|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and its amplitude increases. Approaching the Bristol Channel, a segment of the wave has to accommodate to the ever-decreasing width by raising its height. When it reaches the Severn proper, its width has decreased from a {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} or so to less than {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, and its height is nearly {{convert|50|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. As the bed of the estuary starts to rise and the sides continue to converge, the bore forms and begins to surge up the river in a tidal stream. The front edge of the wave is steep and the trailing edge flatter. The bore consists of three or four sizeable waves followed by a few of diminishing size. As with other waves, the wave tends to break in shallow places and near the bank, and flow smoothly in deep water.<ref name=Rowbotham1967/> The wave travels upstream against the river current at a speed of {{convert|8|to|13|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=pretor-pinney>{{cite book|last=Pretor-Pinney|first=Gavin|title=The Wavewatcher's companion |year=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-4088-0976-1 |pages=239\u2013242}}</ref>\n\nIn the lower, broader part of the estuary near [[Avonmouth]], the tidal surge advances as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past [[Sharpness]], the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to the eastern side of the river. Above Longney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From [[Minsterworth]] to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of [[Alney Island]]. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at [[Tewkesbury]], and even the foot of the weir at [[Worcester]] may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.<ref name=\"Rowbotham, Severn Bore\" >{{cite book |last=Rowbotham |first=Fred |title=Severn Bore |isbn=0-7153-8508-9 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |year=1983 |origyear=1964|pages=19\u201326}}</ref>\n\n==Timing==\n[[File:Severn Bore imminent - geograph.org.uk - 1735599.jpg|thumb|This bore, near the Severn Bore Inn, was smaller than predicted.]]\nThe largest bores occur around the times of the equinoxes but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores are associated with the phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening.

The bore height is increased by a strong southwest or west wind, low barometric pressure, about {{convert|2|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of fresh water below Gloucester and well-scoured channels in the estuary. The height is decreased by strong winds from the east or north, high barometric pressure and little fresh water below Gloucester or excessive fresh water.<ref name=Rowbotham1967>{{cite book |title=The Severn and its Bore |last=Rowbotham |first=F.R. |year=1967 |publisher=The Raleigh Press |pages=12\u201319 }}</ref> The bore is made earlier by strong southwest or west wind, low barometric pressure, between two and five feet of fresh water, and shorter and well-scoured channels in the estuary.

The wind direction out at sea is of more significance than the local air-flow.<ref name=Rowbotham1967/>\n\nBeing the onset of the flood tide, the bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. The Severn bore is not a self-reinforcing solitary wave or [[soliton]] but rather a shock wave which is formed because the wave is travelling faster than the wave speed in water above the bore (see [[tidal bore]] for more details). The passing of the bore causes a churning of the water, and the myriads of tiny bubbles popping contributes much of the roaring sound made by the bore.<ref name=Rowbotham1967/> The largest recorded bore was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of {{convert|9.2|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} at Stonebench.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web |url=http://www.severn-bore.co.uk/facts.html |title=Facts |work=The Severn Bore |accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Viewpoints ==\n[[File:Severn Bore near Over Bridge, Gloucester - geograph.org.uk - 346180.jpg|thumb|The Severn bore near Over Bridge]]\nThere are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen; viewers do not have to restrict themselves to these because most of the river banks and floodbanks are public footpaths.

Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Hadfield |title=The Canals of South and South East England |year=1969 |publisher=David and Charles |isbn=0-7153-4693-8 |page=348}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Surfers riding the Severn Bore - geograph.org.uk - 369764.jpg|thumb|left|Surfers riding the Severn bore]]\n[[River surfing]] enthusiasts attempt to surf along on the wave, which can be {{convert|7|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} high.<ref name=Witts>{{cite book|author=Witts, Chris |title=The Severn Bore: An Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT7 |year=2013 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1102-0 |pages=7\u20139}}</ref> The river was first surfed in 1955 by [[World War II]] veteran [[Jack Churchill]], a [[Military Cross]] recipient renowned both for carrying a [[Scottish broadsword]], and for being the only Allied soldier to kill an enemy with a longbow during the war.

These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Hadfield |title=The Canals of South and South East England |year=1969 |publisher=David and Charles |isbn=0-7153-4693-8 |page=348}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Surfers riding the Severn Bore - geograph.org.uk - 369764.jpg|thumb|left|Surfers riding the Severn bore]]\n[[River surfing]] enthusiasts attempt to surf along on the wave, which can be {{convert|7|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} high.<ref name=Witts>{{cite book|author=Witts, Chris |title=The Severn Bore: An Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT7 |year=2013 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1102-0 |pages=7\u20139}}</ref> The river was first surfed in 1955 by [[World War II]] veteran [[Jack Churchill]], a [[Military Cross]] recipient renowned both for carrying a [[Scottish broadsword]], and for being the only Allied soldier to kill an enemy with a longbow during the war.

The game featured [[voice artist]]ry by British comedic actor [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Marc Silk]].\n\nThe tune for the game is [[John Philip Sousa]]'s [[Liberty Bell (march)|Liberty Bell March]].

Voice work is delivered in thick, over-the-top accents, with comical lines emphasizing the stereotypical nature of each represented nation, usually acting in an exaggerated manner (some portrayals of which were even held during both World Wars), or speaking about topics relevant to a stereotype, acting primarily as the game's source of humor.<ref name=Eurogamer/> The six nations include the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[United States of America|USA]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref name=\"game manual\"/>\n\nThe UK is represented by \"Tommy's Trotters\" (named after [[Tommy Atkins|Tommys]]), who are clothed in green and wear standard [[Brodie helmet|British WW1 helmets]].

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Florida Marlins]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for 17 seasons.\n\nThe [[New York Mets]] drafted Burnett in the eighth round of the [[1995 MLB draft]], out of [[Central Arkansas Christian Schools|Central Arkansas Christian School]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]], where he helped lead the team to back-to-back state championships. The Mets traded him to the Marlins, and Burnett made his MLB debut in {{by|1999}}. He signed with the Blue Jays as a free agent, before the {{by|2006}} season, and with the Yankees before the {{by|2009}} season. The Yankees traded Burnett to the Pirates before the {{by|2012}} season. After two years in Pittsburgh, he signed with the Phillies, where he played one season, before rejoining the Pirates for his final season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hartstein|first1=Larry|title=A. J.

He led the [[National League]] (NL) in shutouts in {{by|2002}}, and the [[American League]] (AL) in [[strikeout]]s in {{by|2008}}. Burnett was a member of the [[2009 World Series]] champion Yankees. He was selected for the NL roster for the [[2015 MLB All-Star Game]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early career===\nBurnett was an eighth-round pick of the [[New York Mets]] in the 1995 amateur draft. He was traded to the Marlins with [[Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez (pitcher, born 1974)|Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez]] and Robert Stratton for [[Al Leiter]] and [[Ralph Milliard]] before the 1998 season when the Marlins dismantled their [[1997 World Series]] championship roster. He was first called up to the Marlins from Class AA [[Portland Sea Dogs|Portland]] in 1999, despite having a record of 6\u201312 and an ERA of 5.52 with Portland.\n\n===Major leagues===\n\n====Florida Marlins====\nBurnett played parts of 1999 and 2000 with the Marlins; his first full regular season with the Marlins came in 2001, when he went 11\u201312 with an ERA of 4.05. On May 12, 2001, Burnett pitched a [[no-hitter]] against the [[San Diego Padres]] in a 3\u20130 victory, striking out seven and [[base on balls|walking]] nine. His game-worn cap and a baseball from the game are on display at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Burnett/Burnett_facts.html |website=jockbio.com |title=JockBio: A. J. Burnett Facts |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> On September 7, 2001, Burnett threw a warm-up pitch that accidentally struck the window of a moving pick-up truck.\n\nIn 2002, he held an ERA of 3.30 and finished with a 12\u20139 record and 203 strikeouts, career bests that he did not top until 2008. He threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters in 2002, averaging 94.9&nbsp;miles per hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2002&month=0|title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2002 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Pitch Type Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball|publisher=[[Fangraphs]]|date=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Burnett was limited to four starts before missing the rest of the season due to [[Tommy John surgery]]. He spent the postseason on the injured reserve list until the Marlins won the [[2003 World Series]] against the Yankees. He returned in June 2004 and made 19 starts for the Marlins, going 7\u20136 with an ERA of 3.68. Even during 2004, his first season back from having the surgery, he was able to throw 102&nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He was shut down for most of September 2004 due to a less serious elbow injury.\n\nThe 2005 season was Burnett's last with the Marlins before he became eligible for free agency. As former teammate [[Carl Pavano]] had done in the 2004 off-season, he wanted to test the market rather than take whatever new contract the Marlins gave him. Since he was likely to price himself out of the Marlins' budget, he was sought after by several other teams before the July 31 trade deadline, but he ended up not being traded.\n\nBurnett seemed to be pitching his best games of the season right around the trade deadline. After he took the loss in the Marlins' first game after the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break, dropping his record to 5\u20136, he strung together seven consecutive wins. The last of those wins was on August 19, when he pitched eight shutout innings against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He then lost six consecutive decisions, including four losses in five starts (with an ERA in that span of 5.93) during the Marlins' failed wild-card chase in September, to close out the season with a 12\u201312 record despite a 3.44 ERA.\n\nOn September 27, 2005, Burnett was asked by the Marlins to leave the team. The request came a day after he made comments criticizing the organization: \"We played scared. We managed scared. We coached scared\", he told reporters following the Marlins' 5\u20133 loss at [[Turner Field]]. \"I'm sick of it, man. It's depressing around here. A 3\u20130 ballgame, I give up one run and leave guys on base, it's like they expect us to mess up. And when we do, they chew us out. There is no positive, nothing around here for anybody.\"<ref name=\"marlins\">{{cite news|author=Joe Frisaro |url=http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050926&content_id=1225274&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla |title=Burnett asked to leave Marlins |publisher=Florida.marlins.mlb.com |date=September 26, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMarlins manager [[Jack McKeon]] called Burnett into his office and broke the news.

After Burnett's contract with the Marlins expired, general manager [[Larry Beinfest]] did not attempt to re-sign him, which was unlikely to happen anyway, given Florida's financial constraints and the market for Burnett.\n\nHe threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters in 2005, averaging 95.6&nbsp;miles per hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2005&month=0|title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2005 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Pitch Type Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball|publisher=[[Fangraphs]]|date=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBurnett had criticized McKeon for not allowing the team's less experienced players to have much playing time. Although probably not because of Burnett's comments, McKeon decided to let rookie [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], a September call up from the Class AA [[Carolina Mudcats (1991\u20132011)|Carolina Mudcats]], make the first major league start of his career on September 30, 2005. Previously, Burnett was scheduled to make his last start of the year at that game.\n\nBurnett declared free agency on October 27, the first day after the end of the [[2005 World Series]].\n\n[[File:A-j-burnett-may-22-2008.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett pitching for the [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] in 2008.]]\n\n====Toronto Blue Jays====\nOn the morning of December 6, 2005, at the Baseball [[Winter Meetings]] being held in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] signed Burnett to a five-year, $55&nbsp;million deal.\n\nThe Blue Jays took a chance by signing Burnett due to his being prone to injuries, and the 2006 season began with him going on the [[disabled list]] when a piece of scar tissue\u2014remnants of his Tommy John surgery\u2014broke off in his pitching arm. However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like [[Matt Morris (baseball)|Matt Morris]] and [[Paul Byrd]] had less impressive career stats, even though they had fewer health risks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2005/12/rotoworld-on-bu.html|title=RotoWorld On Burnett: \"Very Good Signing\"|accessdate=September 21, 2008|publisher=MLB Trade Rumors}}</ref>\n\nBurnett was activated on April 15, 2006 and made a start against the [[Chicago White Sox]], giving up four runs in six innings of work. In his next start, against the [[Boston Red Sox]], Burnett was removed from the game after only four innings due to soreness in his right arm. He would end up on the disabled list again, this time for over two months. Burnett finished the 2006 year on a strong note however, finishing the season with a 10\u20138&nbsp;record and a 3.98&nbsp;ERA.\n\nAfter opening the 2007 season with a very poor outing against the [[Detroit Tigers]], lasting only 2.0&nbsp;innings and allowing five hits and six runs (27.00&nbsp;ERA), Burnett settled down in his next four starts, finishing April 2\u20131, with an ERA of 4.18.\n\nThe Blue Jays experienced a number of injuries early, including losing All-Star closer [[B. J. Ryan]] for the season due to an elbow injury, and Opening Day starter [[Roy Halladay]] to an [[appendectomy]] for four weeks. Burnett was the only pitcher to make all his starts through the first two months of the season. In that period, Burnett posted a 3.98&nbsp;ERA, throwing 71.0&nbsp;innings. Burnett missed 48&nbsp;games during two stints on the disabled list, finishing the 2007 season 10\u20138 with an ERA of 3.75.\n\nThe 2008 season started off with frustration for Burnett due to a right index finger injury he suffered during the offseason, the nail of the index finger partially torn after it was caught in a closing car door.\n\nAgainst [[Chicago White Sox]] pitcher [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]] in early September at [[U.S. Cellular Field]], Burnett took a no-hitter into the sixth inning before giving up a hard hit that bounced off [[Scott Rolen]]'s glove, but got the win. Vazquez himself also pitched well, not giving up a hit until the fourth inning but ultimately took the loss.\n\nOn September 24, in Burnett's final start of the season (number 34), he pitched against the Yankees, lasting eight innings, giving up two runs (one earned), seven hits and striking out 11, to finish off the season with an AL-leading 231 strikeouts. When he was relieved in the beginning of the ninth inning, he received a very long and memorable standing ovation and came out for a curtain call after being congratulated by the players. Despite his outing, he was awarded a no-decision, and the Jays lost 6\u20132 in extra innings.\n\nBurnett finished the 2008 season with an 18\u201310 record and established career highs in almost every single pitching category. He set a career high with 18 wins, appeared in 35 games while starting 34 games, pitched 221{{fraction|1|3}} innings, and led the American league with 231 strikeouts. His 34 starts also led the AL, and he threw [[curveball]]s a higher percentage of the time than any other AL starter; 29.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2008&month=0|title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2008 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Pitch Type Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball|publisher=[[Fangraphs]]|date=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> His five-year contract with the Blue Jays allowed him to opt out at the end of the 2008 season, and he chose to do so, becoming a free agent.\n\n[[File:001B4476 A.

Burnett Facts |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> On September 7, 2001, Burnett threw a warm-up pitch that accidentally struck the window of a moving pick-up truck.\n\nIn 2002, he held an ERA of 3.30 and finished with a 12\u20139 record and 203 strikeouts, career bests that he did not top until 2008. He threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters in 2002, averaging 94.9&nbsp;miles per hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2002&month=0|title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2002 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Pitch Type Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball|publisher=[[Fangraphs]]|date=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Burnett was limited to four starts before missing the rest of the season due to [[Tommy John surgery]]. He spent the postseason on the injured reserve list until the Marlins won the [[2003 World Series]] against the Yankees. He returned in June 2004 and made 19 starts for the Marlins, going 7\u20136 with an ERA of 3.68. Even during 2004, his first season back from having the surgery, he was able to throw 102&nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He was shut down for most of September 2004 due to a less serious elbow injury.\n\nThe 2005 season was Burnett's last with the Marlins before he became eligible for free agency. As former teammate [[Carl Pavano]] had done in the 2004 off-season, he wanted to test the market rather than take whatever new contract the Marlins gave him. Since he was likely to price himself out of the Marlins' budget, he was sought after by several other teams before the July 31 trade deadline, but he ended up not being traded.\n\nBurnett seemed to be pitching his best games of the season right around the trade deadline. After he took the loss in the Marlins' first game after the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break, dropping his record to 5\u20136, he strung together seven consecutive wins. The last of those wins was on August 19, when he pitched eight shutout innings against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He then lost six consecutive decisions, including four losses in five starts (with an ERA in that span of 5.93) during the Marlins' failed wild-card chase in September, to close out the season with a 12\u201312 record despite a 3.44 ERA.\n\nOn September 27, 2005, Burnett was asked by the Marlins to leave the team. The request came a day after he made comments criticizing the organization: \"We played scared. We managed scared. We coached scared\", he told reporters following the Marlins' 5\u20133 loss at [[Turner Field]]. \"I'm sick of it, man. It's depressing around here. A 3\u20130 ballgame, I give up one run and leave guys on base, it's like they expect us to mess up. And when we do, they chew us out. There is no positive, nothing around here for anybody.\"<ref name=\"marlins\">{{cite news|author=Joe Frisaro |url=http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050926&content_id=1225274&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla |title=Burnett asked to leave Marlins |publisher=Florida.marlins.mlb.com |date=September 26, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMarlins manager [[Jack McKeon]] called Burnett into his office and broke the news.

After Burnett's contract with the Marlins expired, general manager [[Larry Beinfest]] did not attempt to re-sign him, which was unlikely to happen anyway, given Florida's financial constraints and the market for Burnett.\n\nHe threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters in 2005, averaging 95.6&nbsp;miles per hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2005&month=0|title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2005 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Pitch Type Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball|publisher=[[Fangraphs]]|date=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBurnett had criticized McKeon for not allowing the team's less experienced players to have much playing time. Although probably not because of Burnett's comments, McKeon decided to let rookie [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], a September call up from the Class AA [[Carolina Mudcats (1991\u20132011)|Carolina Mudcats]], make the first major league start of his career on September 30, 2005. Previously, Burnett was scheduled to make his last start of the year at that game.\n\nBurnett declared free agency on October 27, the first day after the end of the [[2005 World Series]].\n\n[[File:A-j-burnett-may-22-2008.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett pitching for the [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] in 2008.]]\n\n====Toronto Blue Jays====\nOn the morning of December 6, 2005, at the Baseball [[Winter Meetings]] being held in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] signed Burnett to a five-year, $55&nbsp;million deal.\n\nThe Blue Jays took a chance by signing Burnett due to his being prone to injuries, and the 2006 season began with him going on the [[disabled list]] when a piece of scar tissue\u2014remnants of his Tommy John surgery\u2014broke off in his pitching arm. However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like [[Matt Morris (baseball)|Matt Morris]] and [[Paul Byrd]] had less impressive career stats, even though they had fewer health risks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2005/12/rotoworld-on-bu.html|title=RotoWorld On Burnett: \"Very Good Signing\"|accessdate=September 21, 2008|publisher=MLB Trade Rumors}}</ref>\n\nBurnett was activated on April 15, 2006 and made a start against the [[Chicago White Sox]], giving up four runs in six innings of work. In his next start, against the [[Boston Red Sox]], Burnett was removed from the game after only four innings due to soreness in his right arm. He would end up on the disabled list again, this time for over two months. Burnett finished the 2006 year on a strong note however, finishing the season with a 10\u20138&nbsp;record and a 3.98&nbsp;ERA.\n\nAfter opening the 2007 season with a very poor outing against the [[Detroit Tigers]], lasting only 2.0&nbsp;innings and allowing five hits and six runs (27.00&nbsp;ERA), Burnett settled down in his next four starts, finishing April 2\u20131, with an ERA of 4.18.\n\nThe Blue Jays experienced a number of injuries early, including losing All-Star closer [[B. J. Ryan]] for the season due to an elbow injury, and Opening Day starter [[Roy Halladay]] to an [[appendectomy]] for four weeks. Burnett was the only pitcher to make all his starts through the first two months of the season. In that period, Burnett posted a 3.98&nbsp;ERA, throwing 71.0&nbsp;innings. Burnett missed 48&nbsp;games during two stints on the disabled list, finishing the 2007 season 10\u20138 with an ERA of 3.75.\n\nThe 2008 season started off with frustration for Burnett due to a right index finger injury he suffered during the offseason, the nail of the index finger partially torn after it was caught in a closing car door.\n\nAgainst [[Chicago White Sox]] pitcher [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]] in early September at [[U.S. Cellular Field]], Burnett took a no-hitter into the sixth inning before giving up a hard hit that bounced off [[Scott Rolen]]'s glove, but got the win. Vazquez himself also pitched well, not giving up a hit until the fourth inning but ultimately took the loss.\n\nOn September 24, in Burnett's final start of the season (number 34), he pitched against the Yankees, lasting eight innings, giving up two runs (one earned), seven hits and striking out 11, to finish off the season with an AL-leading 231 strikeouts. When he was relieved in the beginning of the ninth inning, he received a very long and memorable standing ovation and came out for a curtain call after being congratulated by the players. Despite his outing, he was awarded a no-decision, and the Jays lost 6\u20132 in extra innings.\n\nBurnett finished the 2008 season with an 18\u201310 record and established career highs in almost every single pitching category. He set a career high with 18 wins, appeared in 35 games while starting 34 games, pitched 221{{fraction|1|3}} innings, and led the American league with 231 strikeouts. His 34 starts also led the AL, and he threw [[curveball]]s a higher percentage of the time than any other AL starter; 29.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2008&month=0|title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2008 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Pitch Type Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball|publisher=[[Fangraphs]]|date=|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> His five-year contract with the Blue Jays allowed him to opt out at the end of the 2008 season, and he chose to do so, becoming a free agent.\n\n[[File:001B4476 A.

He was commissioned by Peter Burdett (of The Pitcairn Gallery) in the 1970s to paint Lyon in France and was represented by The Pitcairn until 1985 when the then owner, Wendy Levy, sold the gallery. In the 1980s he had exhibitions in Windsor and Eton and self organised shows in and around the Cheshire area including at Adlington Hall <ref> The Northern School: A Reappraisal</ref> and in 1989 he was featured in a major book about Northern Artists<ref>A Northern School</ref> by the artist and critic Peter Davies. Turner was \"re-discovered\" by David Gunning, an art dealer from Todmorden, in 2000, when Turner was 80.\n\n[[Parkinson's disease]] eventually forced Turner to stop painting. In 2005, he was given a retrospective at [[Gallery Oldham]] with an accompanying book.<ref>William Turner, An English Expressionist</ref> An exhibition of Turner's work took place at Clark Art in Hale, Cheshire, in 2010.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* A Northern School, Lancashire Artists of the 20th Century 1989, Peter Davies, {{ISBN|978-0948265730}}\n* William Ralph Turner by Stuart Archer & Bill Clark\n* ''William Turner, An English Expressionist'', 2005, Paul Barker and Stephen Whittle, {{ISBN|978-0955038501}}\n* William Ralph Turner in \"''The Northern School: A Reappraisal''\", 2015, Martin Regan, {{ISBN|978-1527203204}} \n* William Ralph Turner, Compelling Visions by Dr Paul Morgan\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.todmordenfineart.co.uk/tm/WilliamRT.eb\n* http://www.clark-art.co.uk\n* Ralph Turner's work at [http://www.gateway-gallery.co.uk/artists/william-ralph-turner/ Gateway Gallery] \n* Ralph Turner's work at [https://artuk.org/discover/artists/turner-william-ralph-19202013 ArtUK]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, William}}\n[[Category:1920 births]]\n[[Category:2013 deaths]]\n[[Category:Modern painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century English painters]]\n[[Category:English male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century English painters]]\n[[Category:People from Chorlton-on-Medlock]]\n", "name_user": "Billclark007", "label": "safe", "comment": "literature additions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ralph_Turner"}

{"title_page": "History of the Charlotte Hornets", "text_new": "{{short description|Sports team history}}\nThe history of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Charlotte Hornets]] dates to 1985, when George Shinn first thought of bringing professional basketball to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Since then, the Hornets have recorded ten playoff appearances under two different franchises.\n\n==Early years==\n===1985\u20131988: birth of the Hornets===\nIn 1985, the NBA, with 23 teams, was planning to expand by four teams by the 1988\u201389 season. [[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]'s four North Carolina teams, as well as local teams [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|UNC Charlotte]], [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]], and [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C. Smith]], had large and loyal fan bases. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]], from 1969 to 1974.\n\nSome critics doubted that Charlotte, then mostly known for banking, could support an NBA team; one ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' columnist joked, \"The only franchise Charlotte is going to get is one with [[Golden Arches]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/montpelier/issues/winter02/main/hockey.html |title=Montpelier \u2013 James Madison University Magazine |publisher=Jmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  However, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena under construction that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to award the NBA's 24th franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the team was intended to be named the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. That name was derived from the city's fierce resistance to [[British people|British]] occupation during the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], which prompted the British commander, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], to refer to it as \"a veritable hornet's nest of rebellion\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lassiter |first=Emily |title=Charlotte Hornets |url=http://blogs.lib.unc.edu/ncm/index.php/2009/08/24/charlotte-hornets/comment-page-1/ |work=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Posnanski |first=Joe |title=A brief history of the Charlotte Hornets (and other things) |url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/22/a-brief-history-of-the-charlotte-hornets-and-other-things/ |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The name had been used for previous Charlotte sports teams, including a [[minor league baseball]] team from 1901 to 1972, and  a [[World Football League]] team that played there from 1974 to 1975. In addition the [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|Charlotte 49ers]] and [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson Wildcats]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] play annually for the Hornets' Nest Trophy.\n\nThe team received attention when it chose [[teal (color)|teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with many pro and amateur clubs soon following with teal in their color schemes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The team's uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. Similar designs by the [[Orlando Magic]], [[Toronto Raptors]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[Chicago Bulls]], and [[Indiana Pacers]] followed soon after.\n\nShinn hired [[Carl Scheer]], a longtime NBA executive, as the team's first general manager. Scheer sought a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible, with a goal of making the playoffs in five years. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach.\n\nIn 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].\n\n===1988\u20131991===\nIn their [[1988\u201389 Charlotte Hornets season|inaugural season]] the Hornets were led by ex-Pistons guard [[Kelly Tripucka]], who provided instant offense and was Charlotte's top scorer for the franchise's first two seasons. Other notable players included sharpshooting rookie (and first draft selection) [[Rex Chapman]], a long-distance scoring threat, and floor general [[Muggsy Bogues]], the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3\". The Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], and was a 133\u201393 loss to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=1988-11-04 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  The opening night lineup included Tripucka, [[Kurt Rambis]], [[Dave Hoppen]], [[Robert Reid (basketball)|Robert Reid]], and [[Rickey Green]].

Tripucka would score 40 points twice more that season. On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 at the buzzer in Jordan's professional debut in [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Muggsy Bogues set a club record on April 23, handing out 19 assists in a game against the [[Boston Celtics]]. The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20 wins and 62 losses.\n\nDespite concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit in their first season, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games\u2014almost nine consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. The team lost their first five games before defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first meeting between the two franchises. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following a dismal 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle during the second half, suffering through a 3\u201331 stretch from January through March. In the end, the team took a step backwards, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record \u2013 one game worse than their previous season.\n\nIn the [[1990 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected guard [[Kendall Gill]] with the 5th overall pick. The team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|1990\u201391 season]]. They won eight of their first 15 games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next 11 games and falling to 8\u201318. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished their third season with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\n==Playoffs and success==\n===1991\u20131995===\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but in the end, they finished [[1991\u201392 Charlotte Hornets season|the season]] with a record of 31\u201351. Despite continuing to improve, the Hornets failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.\n\n====1992\u20131993: first playoff appearance====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. The Hornets now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game. The [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], the Hornets finished the regular season with 50 wins and 32 losses, and returned to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Johnson\u2013Mourning era would come to an end, as the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].\n\n===1995\u20131998===\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive, but failed to qualify for the playoffs during the season, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow|Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by NBA legend [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]]. They acquired center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for the rights to [[Kobe Bryant]], who the Hornets picked 13th in the draft. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing with 54 victories compared to only 28 losses, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Rice finishing third in the league in scoring, earning all-NBA second team honors, and was also the All-Star Game MVP, setting several scoring records. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three straight games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]] season was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331  record; Rice had another good season, as he finished sixth in league scoring and earned all-NBA third team honors. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, and advanced to the second round, only to again be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n==End of an era==\n===1998\u20132002: final years of original Hornets===\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season was turbulent. The season didn't start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season, with the highest winning percentage among Hornets head coaches. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the franchise's fifth head coach. The team finished the season with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] saw a return to prominence, with the addition of point guard [[Baron Davis]], the third overall draft pick. The Hornets tore through much of the season, but tragedy struck on January 12, 2000, when fan favorite and top reserve [[Bobby Phills]] was killed in an automobile accident. The Hornets retired his No. 13 on February 9, 2000. After finishing with a 49\u201333 record, the team returned to the playoffs, where they lost to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round. The season, however, was overshadowed by events off the court. The team's popularity had begun to sag due to fan discontent with owner George Shinn's personnel moves; he had reportedly traded Mourning and other stars out of an unwillingness to pay market value. Additionally, [[Michael Jordan]], a North Carolina native, began negotiations to become part-owner, but talks collapsed when Shinn refused to grant Jordan control over basketball operations. Because of this, season attendance dropped to eleventh in the league.\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] season, with the additions of [[Jamal Mashburn]] and [[P.J. Brown]], the Hornets managed to return to the playoffs, finishing with a 46\u201336 record. While they upset the third-seeded Heat in the first round and made it to the conference semifinals for the third time in franchise history, they lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in seven games. Despite continuing to play well, their popularity continued to fall, with the team finishing 21st in the league in attendance.\n\nThe Hornets returned to the playoffs [[2001\u201302 NBA season|the following season]], finishing the regular season at 44\u201338. After defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round, they were upended by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in five games in the Conference Semifinals. The team finished twenty-ninth (last) in the league in attendance, a stark contrast to their earlier years in Charlotte. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.\n\n===2002\u20132003: relocation to New Orleans===\nMany attributed the Hornets lapse in popularity  during the late 1990s and early 2000s to the team's owner, [[George Shinn]], who was slowly becoming hated by the fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>  In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the subsequent trial severely tarnished his reputation.  The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn was also discontented with the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], which, although considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26, 2001, both the Hornets and the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] applied for relocation to [[Memphis, Tennessee]],<ref>{{cite web|title=CNNSI.com \u2013 NBA Basketball \u2013 Hornets to apply for relocation to Memphis \u2013 Monday March 26, 2001 05:47 PM |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/03/26/hornets_memphis_ap/ |publisher=SportsIllustrated.CNN.com |date=March 26, 2001 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020208045826/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/03/26/hornets_memphis_ap/ |archivedate=February 8, 2002 }}</ref> which was ultimately [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|won by the Grizzlies]]. Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], or [[St. Louis]]. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena (Savvis Center, now known as the [[Enterprise Center]]) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have an previously had hosted an NBA franchise \u2014 the [[St. Louis Hawks]], who moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1968.\n\nFinally, a new arena in [[Charlotte center city|Uptown]], which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (later to become Time Warner Cable Arena and now known as the [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team.  Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage.  However, just days before the referendum, Mayor [[Pat McCrory]] vetoed a [[living wage]] ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum. They felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid enough to make a living.<ref>[http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes World Class City, Third World Paycheck] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113092536/http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes |date=2009-01-13 }}.

Despite the departures of key players [[Raymond Felton]] and [[Tyson Chandler]], the Bobcats started their season hoping to once again make the playoffs. However, they struggled early, and on December 22, 2010, following a dismal 9\u201319 start, Michael Jordan announced that [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] had stepped down as Head Coach. That same day, veteran coach [[Paul Silas]] returned to Charlotte for the first time since 2001. On February 24, 2011, at the NBA trade deadline, the Bobcats moved to clear [[salary cap]] space by sending former all-star forward [[Gerald Wallace]] to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for two first round draft picks, [[Joel Przybilla]], [[Sean Marks]], and [[Dante Cunningham]]. They also sent veteran center [[Nazr Mohammed]] to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] for [[D. J. White]] and [[Morris Peterson]]. Going down the stretch, the injuries to [[Stephen Jackson]] and [[Tyrus Thomas]] derailed any chances of Charlotte trying to catch the [[Indiana Pacers]], who swept them 4\u20130 in the regular season to secure the eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season with a 34\u201348 record, finishing 25\u201329 under Paul Silas.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, the Bobcats hired former Portland Trail Blazers general manager Rich Cho for their own GM and promoted Rod Higgins to President of Basketball Operations. On the day of the [[2011 NBA draft]] the Bobcats sent [[Stephen Jackson]], [[Shaun Livingston]], and the 19th overall pick to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. In return, the Bobcats received former Duke star [[Corey Maggette]] and the 7th overall pick. They used that pick to draft forward [[Bismack Biyombo]] and then drafted [[Kemba Walker]], the [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player]], with the 9th pick in the draft. They also traded their 2013 second-round draft pick to the Thunder for 7-footer [[Byron Mullens]] and signed sharpshooter [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Reggie Williams]] in free agency. The Bobcats started the [[2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats season|2011\u201312 season]] with a close 96\u201395 win against [[Stephen Jackson]] and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in their home opener but wins would be scarce after that. In the lockout-shortened season the Bobcats struggled and posted an NBA-worst record of 7\u201359, losing the last 23 games of the season. In a nationally televised game against the [[New York Knicks]] the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win rate dropped to 0.106, setting the record for the worst season by an NBA team (because the season was shortened by the lockout, the 1972\u201373 [[Philadelphia 76ers]] kept the record for most losses in a season, with 73). On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the team for the 2012\u201313 season. [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] assistant [[Mike Dunlap]] was named his successor.\n\nDespite having the best chance of winning the draft lottery, the Bobcats did not get the first pick. In the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bobcats selected [[Michael Kidd-Gilchrist]] with the second overall pick. They also selected [[Jeffery Taylor]] with the thirty-first pick. They added [[Ben Gordon]], [[Ramon Sessions]] and [[Brendan Haywood]]. The Bobcats' first game was against the [[Indiana Pacers]], and they won 90\u201389 with a heated last minute battle, snapping their 23-game losing streak. On November 13, 2012, the Bobcats traded guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]] to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] for power forward [[Hakim Warrick]]. The team seemed to rebound with a 7\u20135 start to the season in which 6 of the 7 wins were by 4 points or less. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak in a victory at Chicago on New Year's Eve. They finished 21\u201361, the second-worst record in the league. On April 23, 2013, Dunlap was fired, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style.

Charlotte clinched a playoff berth for the second time in franchise history on April 5, 2014, when they won a road game against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. On April 10, 2014, the Bobcats signed forward [[DJ White]] for the rest of the season. The Bobcats finished the 2013\u201314 regular season at 43\u201339, their second highest number of wins in a season. The Bobcats were swept by defending champions [[Miami Heat]] in the first round of the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]]. The fourth game was also the last one as the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\n===2014\u20132018: return of the Hornets and the birth of Buzz City===\nOn May 20, 2014, the Bobcats became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets. At a press conference, team officials also announced that the renamed Hornets reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets, while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.<ref name=\"Windhorst\"/> Charlotte had already been using footage of the original Hornets as part of the \"Buzz City\" campaign.\n\nTo summarize: after the 2002 season, the original Hornets moved to New Orleans. In 2004, Charlotte was granted a new franchise, the Bobcats. After the 2013\u201314 season, the Bobcats changed their name back to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now [[Retroactive continuity|deemed]] as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are deemed as having joined the league in 2002 as an expansion team.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Hornets had the No. 9 pick from a trade with the [[Detroit Pistons]], which they used to select [[Noah Vonleh]] from [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]]. In the same draft they acquired [[UConn Huskies men's basketball|UConn Husky]] [[Shabazz Napier]] (24th overall pick), [[Dwight Powell]] from [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]], and [[Semaj Christon]] from [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] in the second round, later trading [[Shabazz Napier|Napier]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[P.

The Hornets then traded Hopson to the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] in exchange for cash considerations.\n\nDuring the 2014 first year of free agency as the renamed Hornets, the Hornets signed former [[Indiana Pacers]] shooting guard [[Lance Stephenson]] for three years at $27 million with a team option in the third year. The Hornets also signed former [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] forward [[Marvin Williams]] to a two-year, $14 million contract. They later added former [[New Orleans Pelicans]] guard [[Brian Roberts (basketball)|Brian Roberts]], who became the first player in the modern-day Hornets era to play for both the New Orleans Hornets and the Charlotte Hornets. Charlotte finished the 2014-2015 season with a 33\u201349 record.\n\nAfter the stressful first season as the \"reborn\" Hornets, the Hornets signed and traded for promising young NBA players such as [[Nicolas Batum]], former Knicks star [[Jeremy Lin]], [[Jeremy Lamb]], [[Tyler Hansbrough]], [[Spencer Hawes]] and undrafted rookie [[Aaron Harrison]]. In the [[2015 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] star [[Frank Kaminsky]] with the 9th pick. \nThrough the first 16 games of the 2015-2016 season the Hornets were 9\u20137, including a 7-game home winning streak. This marked first time they were multiple games above .500 since the 2013 season. After Feb. 1, the Hornets went 25\u20139 in the regular season, which became the third-best winning percentage (.736) in that time span, with only the Warriors and Spurs having better marks. On April 2, the Hornets clinched a playoff spot. The Hornets finished 48\u201334, 3rd overall in the division, with their most regular season victories since the 1999\u20132000 season. Charlotte earned the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, where they played No. 3 seed Miami in the first round.

Since then, the Hornets have recorded ten playoff appearances under two different franchises.\n\n==Early years==\n===1985\u20131988: birth of the Hornets===\nIn 1985, the NBA, with 23 teams, was planning to expand by four teams by the 1988\u201389 season. [[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]'s four North Carolina teams, as well as local teams [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|UNC Charlotte]], [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]], and [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C. Smith]], had large and loyal fan bases. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]], from 1969 to 1974.\n\nSome critics doubted that Charlotte, then mostly known for banking, could support an NBA team; one ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' columnist joked, \"The only franchise Charlotte is going to get is one with [[Golden Arches]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/montpelier/issues/winter02/main/hockey.html |title=Montpelier \u2013 James Madison University Magazine |publisher=Jmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  However, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena under construction that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to award the NBA's 24th franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the team was intended to be named the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. That name was derived from the city's fierce resistance to [[British people|British]] occupation during the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], which prompted the British commander, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], to refer to it as \"a veritable hornet's nest of rebellion\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lassiter |first=Emily |title=Charlotte Hornets |url=http://blogs.lib.unc.edu/ncm/index.php/2009/08/24/charlotte-hornets/comment-page-1/ |work=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Posnanski |first=Joe |title=A brief history of the Charlotte Hornets (and other things) |url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/22/a-brief-history-of-the-charlotte-hornets-and-other-things/ |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The name had been used for previous Charlotte sports teams, including a [[minor league baseball]] team from 1901 to 1972, and  a [[World Football League]] team that played there from 1974 to 1975. In addition the [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball|Charlotte 49ers]] and [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson Wildcats]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] play annually for the Hornets' Nest Trophy.\n\nThe team received attention when it chose [[teal (color)|teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with many pro and amateur clubs soon following with teal in their color schemes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The team's uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. Similar designs by the [[Orlando Magic]], [[Toronto Raptors]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[Chicago Bulls]], and [[Indiana Pacers]] followed soon after.\n\nShinn hired [[Carl Scheer]], a longtime NBA executive, as the team's first general manager. Scheer sought a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible, with a goal of making the playoffs in five years. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach.\n\nIn 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].\n\n===1988\u20131991===\nIn their [[1988\u201389 Charlotte Hornets season|inaugural season]] the Hornets were led by ex-Pistons guard [[Kelly Tripucka]], who provided instant offense and was Charlotte's top scorer for the franchise's first two seasons. Other notable players included sharpshooting rookie (and first draft selection) [[Rex Chapman]], a long-distance scoring threat, and floor general [[Muggsy Bogues]], the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3\". The Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], and was a 133\u201393 loss to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=1988-11-04 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>  The opening night lineup included Tripucka, [[Kurt Rambis]], [[Dave Hoppen]], [[Robert Reid (basketball)|Robert Reid]], and [[Rickey Green]].

The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20 wins and 62 losses.\n\nDespite concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit in their first season, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games\u2014almost nine consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. The team lost their first five games before defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first meeting between the two franchises. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following a dismal 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle during the second half, suffering through a 3\u201331 stretch from January through March. In the end, the team took a step backwards, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record \u2013 one game worse than their previous season.\n\nIn the [[1990 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected guard [[Kendall Gill]] with the 5th overall pick. The team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|1990\u201391 season]]. They won eight of their first 15 games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next 11 games and falling to 8\u201318. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished their third season with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\n==Playoffs and success==\n===1991\u20131995===\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but in the end, they finished [[1991\u201392 Charlotte Hornets season|the season]] with a record of 31\u201351. Despite continuing to improve, the Hornets failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.\n\n====1992\u20131993: first playoff appearance====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. The Hornets now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game. The [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], the Hornets finished the regular season with 50 wins and 32 losses, and returned to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Johnson\u2013Mourning era would come to an end, as the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].\n\n===1995\u20131998===\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive, but failed to qualify for the playoffs during the season, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow|Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by NBA legend [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]]. They acquired center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for the rights to [[Kobe Bryant]], who the Hornets picked 13th in the draft. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing with 54 victories compared to only 28 losses, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Rice finishing third in the league in scoring, earning all-NBA second team honors, and was also the All-Star Game MVP, setting several scoring records. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three straight games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]] season was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331  record; Rice had another good season, as he finished sixth in league scoring and earned all-NBA third team honors. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, and advanced to the second round, only to again be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n==End of an era==\n===1998\u20132002: final years of original Hornets===\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season was turbulent. The season didn't start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season, with the highest winning percentage among Hornets head coaches. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the franchise's fifth head coach. The team finished the season with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] saw a return to prominence, with the addition of point guard [[Baron Davis]], the third overall draft pick. The Hornets tore through much of the season, but tragedy struck on January 12, 2000, when fan favorite and top reserve [[Bobby Phills]] was killed in an automobile accident. The Hornets retired his No. 13 on February 9, 2000. After finishing with a 49\u201333 record, the team returned to the playoffs, where they lost to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round. The season, however, was overshadowed by events off the court. The team's popularity had begun to sag due to fan discontent with owner George Shinn's personnel moves; he had reportedly traded Mourning and other stars out of an unwillingness to pay market value. Additionally, [[Michael Jordan]], a North Carolina native, began negotiations to become part-owner, but talks collapsed when Shinn refused to grant Jordan control over basketball operations. Because of this, season attendance dropped to eleventh in the league.\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] season, with the additions of [[Jamal Mashburn]] and [[P.J. Brown]], the Hornets managed to return to the playoffs, finishing with a 46\u201336 record. While they upset the third-seeded Heat in the first round and made it to the conference semifinals for the third time in franchise history, they lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in seven games. Despite continuing to play well, their popularity continued to fall, with the team finishing 21st in the league in attendance.\n\nThe Hornets returned to the playoffs [[2001\u201302 NBA season|the following season]], finishing the regular season at 44\u201338. After defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round, they were upended by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in five games in the Conference Semifinals. The team finished twenty-ninth (last) in the league in attendance, a stark contrast to their earlier years in Charlotte. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.\n\n===2002\u20132003: relocation to New Orleans===\nMany attributed the Hornets lapse in popularity  during the late 1990s and early 2000s to the team's owner, [[George Shinn]], who was slowly becoming hated by the fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>  In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the subsequent trial severely tarnished his reputation.  The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn was also discontented with the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], which, although considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had a limited number of luxury boxes.

Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], or [[St. Louis]]. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena (Savvis Center, now known as the [[Enterprise Center]]) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have an previously had hosted an NBA franchise \u2014 the [[St. Louis Hawks]], who moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1968.\n\nFinally, a new arena in [[Charlotte center city|Uptown]], which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (later to become Time Warner Cable Arena and now known as the [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team.  Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage.  However, just days before the referendum, Mayor [[Pat McCrory]] vetoed a [[living wage]] ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum. They felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid enough to make a living.<ref>[http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes World Class City, Third World Paycheck] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113092536/http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A535&comments=yes |date=2009-01-13 }}.

Despite the departures of key players [[Raymond Felton]] and [[Tyson Chandler]], the Bobcats started their season hoping to once again make the playoffs. However, they struggled early, and on December 22, 2010, following a dismal 9\u201319 start, Michael Jordan announced that [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] had stepped down as Head Coach. That same day, veteran coach [[Paul Silas]] returned to Charlotte for the first time since 2001. On February 24, 2011, at the NBA trade deadline, the Bobcats moved to clear [[salary cap]] space by sending former all-star forward [[Gerald Wallace]] to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for two first round draft picks, [[Joel Przybilla]], [[Sean Marks]], and [[Dante Cunningham]]. They also sent veteran center [[Nazr Mohammed]] to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] for [[D. J. White]] and [[Morris Peterson]]. Going down the stretch, the injuries to [[Stephen Jackson]] and [[Tyrus Thomas]] derailed any chances of Charlotte trying to catch the [[Indiana Pacers]], who swept them 4\u20130 in the regular season to secure the eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season with a 34\u201348 record, finishing 25\u201329 under Paul Silas.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, the Bobcats hired former Portland Trail Blazers general manager Rich Cho for their own GM and promoted Rod Higgins to President of Basketball Operations. On the day of the [[2011 NBA draft]] the Bobcats sent [[Stephen Jackson]], [[Shaun Livingston]], and the 19th overall pick to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. In return, the Bobcats received former Duke star [[Corey Maggette]] and the 7th overall pick. They used that pick to draft forward [[Bismack Biyombo]] and then drafted [[Kemba Walker]], the [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player]], with the 9th pick in the draft. They also traded their 2013 second-round draft pick to the Thunder for 7-footer [[Byron Mullens]] and signed sharpshooter [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Reggie Williams]] in free agency. The Bobcats started the [[2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats season|2011\u201312 season]] with a close 96\u201395 win against [[Stephen Jackson]] and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in their home opener but wins would be scarce after that. In the lockout-shortened season the Bobcats struggled and posted an NBA-worst record of 7\u201359, losing the last 23 games of the season. In a nationally televised game against the [[New York Knicks]] the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win rate dropped to 0.106, setting the record for the worst season by an NBA team (because the season was shortened by the lockout, the 1972\u201373 [[Philadelphia 76ers]] kept the record for most losses in a season, with 73). On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the team for the 2012\u201313 season. [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] assistant [[Mike Dunlap]] was named his successor.\n\nDespite having the best chance of winning the draft lottery, the Bobcats did not get the first pick. In the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bobcats selected [[Michael Kidd-Gilchrist]] with the second overall pick. They also selected [[Jeffery Taylor]] with the thirty-first pick. They added [[Ben Gordon]], [[Ramon Sessions]] and [[Brendan Haywood]]. The Bobcats' first game was against the [[Indiana Pacers]], and they won 90\u201389 with a heated last minute battle, snapping their 23-game losing streak. On November 13, 2012, the Bobcats traded guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]] to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] for power forward [[Hakim Warrick]]. The team seemed to rebound with a 7\u20135 start to the season in which 6 of the 7 wins were by 4 points or less. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak in a victory at Chicago on New Year's Eve. They finished 21\u201361, the second-worst record in the league. On April 23, 2013, Dunlap was fired, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style.

On April 10, 2014, the Bobcats signed forward [[DJ White]] for the rest of the season. The Bobcats finished the 2013\u201314 regular season at 43\u201339, their second highest number of wins in a season. The Bobcats were swept by defending champions [[Miami Heat]] in the first round of the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]]. The fourth game was also the last one as the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\n===2014\u20132018: return of the Hornets and the birth of Buzz City===\nOn May 20, 2014, the Bobcats became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets. At a press conference, team officials also announced that the renamed Hornets reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets, while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.<ref name=\"Windhorst\"/> Charlotte had already been using footage of the original Hornets as part of the \"Buzz City\" campaign.\n\nTo summarize: after the 2002 season, the original Hornets moved to New Orleans. In 2004, Charlotte was granted a new franchise, the Bobcats. After the 2013\u201314 season, the Bobcats changed their name back to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now [[Retroactive continuity|deemed]] as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are deemed as having joined the league in 2002 as an expansion team.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Hornets had the No. 9 pick from a trade with the [[Detroit Pistons]], which they used to select [[Noah Vonleh]] from [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]]. In the same draft they acquired [[UConn Huskies men's basketball|UConn Husky]] [[Shabazz Napier]] (24th overall pick), [[Dwight Powell]] from [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]], and [[Semaj Christon]] from [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] in the second round, later trading [[Shabazz Napier|Napier]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[P. J. Hairston]] from the [[Texas Legends]] of the [[NBA Development League]] (formerly from [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|UNC]]), the rights to the 55th pick ([[Semaj Christon]]), their 2019 second-round pick and cash considerations; [[Dwight Powell|Powell]] and [[Brendan Haywood]] to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] for [[Scotty Hopson]] and cash considerations; and [[Semaj Christon|Christon]] to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] for cash considerations. The Hornets then traded Hopson to the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] in exchange for cash considerations.\n\nDuring the 2014 first year of free agency as the renamed Hornets, the Hornets signed former [[Indiana Pacers]] shooting guard [[Lance Stephenson]] for three years at $27 million with a team option in the third year. The Hornets also signed former [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] forward [[Marvin Williams]] to a two-year, $14 million contract. They later added former [[New Orleans Pelicans]] guard [[Brian Roberts (basketball)|Brian Roberts]], who became the first player in the modern-day Hornets era to play for both the New Orleans Hornets and the Charlotte Hornets. Charlotte finished the 2014-2015 season with a 33\u201349 record.\n\nAfter the stressful first season as the \"reborn\" Hornets, the Hornets signed and traded for promising young NBA players such as [[Nicolas Batum]], former Knicks star [[Jeremy Lin]], [[Jeremy Lamb]], [[Tyler Hansbrough]], [[Spencer Hawes]] and undrafted rookie [[Aaron Harrison]]. In the [[2015 NBA draft]], the Hornets selected [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] star [[Frank Kaminsky]] with the 9th pick. \nThrough the first 16 games of the 2015-2016 season the Hornets were 9\u20137, including a 7-game home winning streak. This marked first time they were multiple games above .500 since the 2013 season. After Feb. 1, the Hornets went 25\u20139 in the regular season, which became the third-best winning percentage (.736) in that time span, with only the Warriors and Spurs having better marks. On April 2, the Hornets clinched a playoff spot. The Hornets finished 48\u201334, 3rd overall in the division, with their most regular season victories since the 1999\u20132000 season. Charlotte earned the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, where they played No. 3 seed Miami in the first round.
