Maine is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|12th smallest by area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|9th least populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|13th least densely populated]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 U.S. states]]. Located in [[New England]], it is bordered by [[New Hampshire]] to the west, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Qu\u00e9bec]] to the northeast and northwest, respectively. Maine is the only state to border exactly one other state, is the easternmost among the [[contiguous United States]], and is the northernmost state east of the [[Great Lakes]].\n\nMaine is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior; and picturesque waterways, as well as its seafood cuisine, especially [[American lobster|lobster]] and [[clam]]s. There is a [[humid continental climate]] throughout most of the state, including coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=60627&cityname=Portland%2C+Maine%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Portland, Maine Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Maine's most populous city is [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and its capital is [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]].\n\nFor thousands of years, [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]] were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine. At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine, several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples inhabited the area. The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]], by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. The first English settlement was the short-lived [[Popham Colony]], established by the [[Plymouth Company]] in 1607. A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate, deprivations, and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years.\n\nAs Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] forces contended for Maine's territory during the [[American Revolution]]. During the [[War of 1812]], the largely-undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a peace treaty that was to include dedicated land on the Michigan peninsula for Native American peoples. Maine was part of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] until 1820, when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. On March 15, 1820, under the [[Missouri Compromise]], it was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as the 23rd state.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Toponymy==\n\nThere is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name \"Maine\", but the most likely origin is that the name was given by early explorers after the former [[Maine (province)|province of Maine]] in [[France]]. Whatever the origin, the name was fixed for English settlers in 1665 when the English King's Commissioners ordered that the \"Province of Maine\" be entered from then on in official records.<ref name=Stewart /> The state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing Franco-American Day, which stated that the state was named after the former French province of Maine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_123rd/billpdfs/HP162901.pdf |format=doc |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |title=Journal of the Senate |publisher=State of Maine, HP1629, item 1, 123rd Maine State Legislature |date=March 6, 2002 |quote=\"WHEREAS, the State of Maine is named after the Province of Maine in France{{nbsp}}...\"\n}}</ref>\n\nOther theories mention earlier places with similar names, or claim it is a [[Navigation|nautical]] reference to the mainland.<ref>{{cite web |first=Emily A. |last=Schroeder |url=http://www.maine.gov/msl/services/reference/meorigin.htm |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |title=Origin of Maine's Name |publisher=Maine State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005630/http://www.maine.gov/msl/services/reference/meorigin.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> Captain John Smith, in his \"Description of New England\" (1614)<ref name=\"Smith1898\">{{cite book|author=John Smith|title=A Description of New England: Or, The Observations and Discoveries of Captain John Smith, (admiral of that Country), in the North of America, in the Year of Our Lord 1614, with the Success of Six Ships that Went the Next Year, 1615; with the Proof of the Present Benefit this Country Affords|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxUOAAAAIAAJ|year=1898|publisher=G.

A second settlement was attempted in 1623 by English explorer and naval Captain [[Christopher Levett]] at a place called [[York, Maine|York]], where he had been granted {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] of England.<ref name=\"Society1884\">{{cite book|author=Massachusetts Historical Society|title=Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bx4XAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA339|year=1884|publisher=The Society|pages=339\u2013}}</ref> It also failed.\n\nCentral Maine was formerly inhabited by people of the [[Androscoggin tribe]] of the [[Abenaki|Abenaki nation]], also known as Arosaguntacook. They were driven out of the area in 1690 during [[King William's War]]. They were relocated at [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]], Canada, which was destroyed by [[Rogers' Rangers]] in 1759, and is now [[Odanak]]. The other Abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats, particularly during [[Dummer's War]], with the capture of [[Norridgewock]] in 1724 and the defeat of the [[Pequawket]] in 1725, which greatly reduced their numbers. They finally withdrew to [[Canada]], where they were settled at [[B\u00e9cancour, Quebec|B\u00e9cancour]] and [[Sillery, Quebec City|Sillery]], and later at St. Francis, along with other refugee tribes from the south.<ref>Bruce G.

Maine was much fought over by the [[French colonial empire|French]], English, and allied natives during the 17th and early 18th centuries, who conducted raids against each other, taking captives for ransom or, in some cases, adoption by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.

Long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the [[War of 1812]] when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession, sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year. Formal secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820, as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], which geographically limited the spread of [[slavery]] and enabled the admission to statehood of [[Missouri]] the following year, keeping a balance between [[slave state|slave]] and free states.<ref>Woodard, Colin. \"Parallel 44: Origins of the Mass Effect\", ''The Working Waterfront'', August 31, 2010.

Carved by glaciers, Somes Sound is considered to be the only [[fjord]] on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of {{convert|175|ft|m|-1}}. The extreme depth and steep drop-off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound.

Most of them are of [[French Canadian American|Canadian]] origin, but in some cases have been living there since prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. There are particularly high concentrations in the northern part of Maine in [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], which is part of a cultural region known as [[Acadia]] that goes over the border into [[New Brunswick]]. Along with the [[Acadians|Acadian]] population in the north, many French came from [[Quebec]] as immigrants between 1840 and 1930.\n\nThe upper [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] valley area was once part of the so-called [[Republic of Madawaska]], before the frontier was decided in the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. Over a quarter of the population of Lewiston, [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], and [[Biddeford]] are Franco-American. Most of the residents of the [[Mid Coast]] and [[Down East]] sections are chiefly of British heritage. Smaller numbers of various other groups, including [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]], have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century [[immigration]] waves.\n\n;Birth data\n''Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+Live births by single race/ethnicity of mother\n|-\n!

Aroostook County is known for its [[potato]] crops. [[Commercial fishing]], once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly [[lobster fishing|lobstering]] and [[groundfishing]]. While lobster is the main seafood focus for Maine, the harvest of both oysters and seaweed are on the rise. In 2015, 14% of the Northeast's total oyster supply came from Maine. In 2017, the production of Maine's seaweed industry was estimated at $20 million per year. The shrimp industry of Maine is on a government-mandated hold. With an ever-decreasing Northern shrimp population, Maine fishermen are no longer allowed to catch and sell shrimp. The hold began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2021.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Losneck|first=Caroline|date=April 2019|title=\"NORTHEAST: Oyster, seaweed industries continue rise in Maine; Northern shrimp shutdown extends 3 years; scup and squid try to find strong markets.\"|url=|journal=National Fisherman|volume=|pages=|via=UMA Library}}</ref> Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water.\n\nMaine's industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper, lumber and wood products, electronic equipment, leather products, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Naval shipbuilding and construction remain key as well, with [[Bath Iron Works]] in Bath and [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in Kittery.\n\nBrunswick Landing, formerly [[Naval Air Station Brunswick]], is also in Maine. Formerly a large support base for the U.S. Navy, the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] campaign initiated the Naval Air Station's closing, despite a government-funded effort to upgrade its facilities. The former base has since been changed into a civilian business park, as well as a new satellite campus for [[Southern Maine Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrra.us/brunswick-landing/|title=Brunswick Landing\u2014Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|author=|date=|website=Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaine is the number one U.S. producer of low-bush [[blueberry|blueberries]] ([[Vaccinium angustifolium]]).

The largest toothpick manufacturing plant in the United States used to be located in [[Strong, Maine]]. The Strong Wood Products plant produced 20 million toothpicks a day. It closed in May 2003.\n\nTourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine's economy. The state is a popular destination for sport [[hunting]] (particularly deer, moose and bear), [[sport fishing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[skiing]], boating, [[camping]] and [[hiking]], among other activities.\n\nHistorically, Maine ports played a key role in national transportation. Beginning around 1880, Portland's rail link and [[ice-free port]] made it Canada's principal winter port, until the aggressive development of [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, in the mid-1900s. In 2013, 12,039,600 [[short tons]] passed into and out of Portland by sea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/wcsc/webpub13/Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|title=Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|website=www.navigationdatacenter.us}}</ref> which places it 45th of U.S. water ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_57.html|title=Table 1-57: Tonnage of Top 50 U.S. Water Ports, Ranked by Total Tons(a)\u2014Bureau of Transportation Statistics|website=www.rita.dot.gov}}</ref> Portland Maine's [[Portland International Jetport]] was recently expanded, providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as [[JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]].\n\nMaine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state, and that number has fallen due to consolidations and mergers, particularly in the [[pulp and paper industry]]. Some of the larger companies that do maintain headquarters in Maine include [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in South Portland; [[IDEXX Laboratories]], in Westbrook; [[Hannaford Bros. Co.]] in Scarborough; [[TD Banknorth|TD Bank]] in Portland; [[L.L.Bean]] in Freeport; and [[Cole Haan]] in Yarmouth. Maine is also the home of the [[Jackson Laboratory]], the world's largest non-profit mammalian genetic research facility and the world's largest supplier of genetically purebred mice.\n\n===Taxation===\n\n{{further|State tax levels in the United States}}\n\nMaine has an [[income tax]] structure containing two brackets, 6.5 and 7.95 percent of personal income.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2013/1040RateSched_13RevJan13.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Before July 2013 Maine had four brackets: 2, 4.5, 7, and 8.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2012/RateSched_12.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Maine's general [[sales tax]] rate is 5.5 percent.

All [[Real property|real]] and tangible [[personal property]] located in the state of Maine is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns, while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor.\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n\n{{Further|Bath Iron Works|Portsmouth Naval Shipyard}}\n\nMaine has a long-standing tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships. The main function of these ships was to transport either cargos or passengers overseas. One of these yards was located in [[Pennellville Historic District]] in what is now Brunswick, Maine. This yard, owned by the Pennell family, was typical of the many family-owned shipbuilding companies of the time period. Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Airports===\n\n[[File:KPWM Aerial Wiki.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portland International Jetport]]]]\n\nMaine receives [[Jet airliner|passenger jet]] service at its two largest airports, the [[Portland International Jetport]] in Portland, and the [[Bangor International Airport]] in Bangor. Both are served daily by many major [[airline]]s to destinations such as New York, [[Atlanta]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. [[Essential Air Service]] also subsidizes service to a number of smaller airports in Maine, bringing small [[turboprop]] aircraft to regional airports such as the [[Augusta State Airport]], [[Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport]], [[Knox County Regional Airport]], and the [[Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle]]. These airports are served by regional providers such as [[Cape Air]] with Cessna 402s, [[PenAir]] with Saab 340s, and [[CommutAir]] with Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.\n\nMany smaller airports are scattered throughout Maine, serving only [[general aviation]] traffic. The [[Eastport Municipal Airport]], for example, is a city-owned public-use airport with 1,200 general aviation aircraft operations each year from single-engine and ultralight aircraft.<ref>KEPM\u2014Eastport, Maine\u2014Eastport Municipal Airport\".

The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor).\n\nThe [[legislative branch]] is the [[Maine Legislature]], a bicameral body composed of the [[Maine House of Representatives]], with 151 members, and the [[Maine Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing laws.\n\nThe [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the [[Governor of Maine]] (currently [[Janet Mills]]). The Governor is elected every four years; no individual may serve more than two consecutive terms in this office. The current [[attorney general of Maine]] is [[Aaron Frey]]. As with other [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor.\n\nThe [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting state laws. The highest court of the state is the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]. The lower courts are the District Court, [[Maine Superior Court|Superior Court]] and Probate Court.

Maine has had two independent governors recently ([[James B. Longley]], 1975\u20131979 and current U.S. Senator [[Angus King]], 1995\u20132003). Maine state politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties.\n\nMaine is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].\n\nOn May 6, 2009, Maine became the fifth state to legalize [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|same-sex marriage]]; however, the law was repealed by voters on November 3, 2009. On November 6, 2012, Maine, along with Maryland and Washington, became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage at the ballot box.<ref>\"[https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/maine-gay-marriage-question-1-results_n_2050863.html Maine Passes Gay Marriage in Historic 'Question 1' Vote]\". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. November 7, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Federal politics===\n\nIn the 1930s, Maine was one of very few states which retained [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] sentiments. In the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of every state other than Maine and [[Vermont]]; these were the only two states in the nation that never voted for Roosevelt in any of his presidential campaigns, though Maine was closely fought in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] and [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. In the 1960s, Maine began to lean toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], especially in [[President of the United States|presidential]] elections. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine, perhaps because of the presence of his running mate, Maine Senator [[Edmund Muskie]], although the state voted Republican in every presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s.\n[[File:United States presidential election in Maine, 2016.svg|thumb|left|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]\n\nSince 1969, two of Maine's four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except [[Nebraska]] gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. Maine split its electoral vote for the first time in 2016, with Donald Trump's strong showing in the more rural central and northern Maine allowing him to capture one of the state's four votes in the Electoral College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/08/mainers-take-matters-into-their-own-hands-after-bitter-presidential-campaign/|title=Trump takes 1 of Maine's 4 electoral votes, in a first for the state|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ross Perot]] achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. In 1992, as an [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]], Perot came in second to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]], despite the long-time presence of the [[Bush family]] summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]]. In 1996, as the nominee of the [[Reform Party (United States)|Reform Party]], Perot did better in Maine than in any other state.\n\nMaine has voted for Democratic Bill Clinton twice, [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], [[John Kerry]] in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]] won one of Maine's electoral votes with Democratic opponent [[Hillary Clinton]] winning the other three. Although Democrats have mostly carried the state in presidential elections in recent years, Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, with Edmund Muskie, [[William Hathaway]] and [[George J. Mitchell]] being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U.S. Senate in the past fifty years.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made major gains in Maine. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. However, in the 2012 elections Democrats managed to recapture both houses of [[Maine Legislature]].\n\nMaine's U.S. senators are Republican [[Susan Collins]] and [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] Angus King. The governor is Democrat [[Janet Mills]]. The state's two members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are Democrats [[Chellie Pingree]] and \n[[Jared Golden]].\n\nMaine is the first state to have introduced ranked-choice voting in federal elections.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html|title = Maine Adopts Ranked-Choice Voting.

The governmental format of most organized towns and [[Plantation (Maine)|plantations]] is the town meeting, while the format of most cities is the council-manager form. {{as of|2013}} the organized municipalities of Maine consist of 23 [[List of cities in Maine|cities]], 431 [[List of towns in Maine|towns]], and 34 [[List of plantations in Maine|plantations]]. Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state's territory. Maine also has three Reservations: [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Indian Island]], Indian Township Reservation, and Pleasant Point Indian Reservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/local/|title=Maine.gov: Local|author=|date=|website=maine.gov|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* The largest municipality in Maine, by population, is the city of Portland (pop. 66,318).\n* The smallest city by population is Eastport (pop. 1,331).\n* The largest town by population is Brunswick (pop. 20,278).\n* The smallest town by population is [[Frye Island, Maine|Frye Island]], a resort town which reported zero year-round population in the 2000 Census; one plantation, [[Glenwood Plantation, Maine|Glenwood Plantation]], also reported a permanent population of zero.\n* In the 2000 census, the smallest town aside from Frye Island was [[Centerville, Maine|Centerville]] with a population of 26, but since that census, Centerville voted to disincorporate and therefore is no longer a town. The next smallest town with a population listed in that census is [[Beddington, Maine|Beddington]] (pop. 50 at the 2010 census).\n* The largest municipality by land area is the town of [[Allagash, Maine|Allagash]], at {{convert|128|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n* The smallest municipality by land area is [[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan Island]], at {{convert|0.86|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The smallest municipality by area that is not an island is [[Randolph, Maine|Randolph]], at {{convert|2.23|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n\n===Unorganized territory===\n\n[[Unorganized territory]] (UT) has no local government. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds. The unorganized territory of Maine consists of more than 400 townships (towns are incorporated, townships are unincorporated), plus many coastal islands that do not lie within any municipal bounds. The UT land area is slightly over half the entire area of the State of Maine. Year-round residents in the UT number approximately 9,000 (about 1.3% of the state's total population), with many more people staying there only seasonally.

Maine is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|12th smallest by area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|9th least populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|13th least densely populated]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 U.S. states]]. Located in [[New England]], it is bordered by [[New Hampshire]] to the west, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Qu\u00e9bec]] to the northeast and northwest, respectively. Maine is the only state to border exactly one other state, is the easternmost among the [[contiguous United States]], and is the northernmost state east of the [[Great Lakes]].\n\nMaine is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior; and picturesque waterways, as well as its seafood cuisine, especially [[American lobster|lobster]] and [[clam]]s. There is a [[humid continental climate]] throughout most of the state, including coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=60627&cityname=Portland%2C+Maine%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Portland, Maine Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Maine's most populous city is [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and its capital is [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]].\n\nFor thousands of years, [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]] were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine. At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine, several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples inhabited the area. The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]], by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. The first English settlement was the short-lived [[Popham Colony]], established by the [[Plymouth Company]] in 1607. A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate, deprivations, and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years.\n\nAs Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] forces contended for Maine's territory during the [[American Revolution]]. During the [[War of 1812]], the largely-undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a peace treaty that was to include dedicated land on the Michigan peninsula for Native American peoples. Maine was part of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] until 1820, when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. On March 15, 1820, under the [[Missouri Compromise]], it was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as the 23rd state.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Toponymy==\n\nThere is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name \"Maine\", but the most likely origin is that the name was given by early explorers after the former [[Maine (province)|province of Maine]] in [[France]]. Whatever the origin, the name was fixed for English settlers in 1665 when the English King's Commissioners ordered that the \"Province of Maine\" be entered from then on in official records.<ref name=Stewart /> The state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing Franco-American Day, which stated that the state was named after the former French province of Maine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_123rd/billpdfs/HP162901.pdf |format=doc |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |title=Journal of the Senate |publisher=State of Maine, HP1629, item 1, 123rd Maine State Legislature |date=March 6, 2002 |quote=\"WHEREAS, the State of Maine is named after the Province of Maine in France{{nbsp}}...\"\n}}</ref>\n\nOther theories mention earlier places with similar names, or claim it is a [[Navigation|nautical]] reference to the mainland.<ref>{{cite web |first=Emily A. |last=Schroeder |url=http://www.maine.gov/msl/services/reference/meorigin.htm |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |title=Origin of Maine's Name |publisher=Maine State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005630/http://www.maine.gov/msl/services/reference/meorigin.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> Captain John Smith, in his \"Description of New England\" (1614)<ref name=\"Smith1898\">{{cite book|author=John Smith|title=A Description of New England: Or, The Observations and Discoveries of Captain John Smith, (admiral of that Country), in the North of America, in the Year of Our Lord 1614, with the Success of Six Ships that Went the Next Year, 1615; with the Proof of the Present Benefit this Country Affords|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxUOAAAAIAAJ|year=1898|publisher=G.

Afterwards, many of these people were driven from their natural territories, but most of the tribes of Maine continued, unchanged, until the [[American Revolution]]. Before this point, however, most of these people were considered separate nations.

Long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the [[War of 1812]] when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession, sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year. Formal secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820, as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], which geographically limited the spread of [[slavery]] and enabled the admission to statehood of [[Missouri]] the following year, keeping a balance between [[slave state|slave]] and free states.<ref>Woodard, Colin. \"Parallel 44: Origins of the Mass Effect\", ''The Working Waterfront'', August 31, 2010.

There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets. Inland are lakes, rivers, forests, and mountains.

Prominent glacial features include [[Somes Sound]] and Bubble Rock, both part of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island. Carved by glaciers, Somes Sound is considered to be the only [[fjord]] on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of {{convert|175|ft|m|-1}}. The extreme depth and steep drop-off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound. These features also have made it attractive for boat builders, such as the prestigious [[Hinckley Yachts]].\n\nBubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]], is a large boulder perched on the edge of Bubble Mountain in [[Acadia National Park]].

Most of them are of [[French Canadian American|Canadian]] origin, but in some cases have been living there since prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. There are particularly high concentrations in the northern part of Maine in [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], which is part of a cultural region known as [[Acadia]] that goes over the border into [[New Brunswick]]. Along with the [[Acadians|Acadian]] population in the north, many French came from [[Quebec]] as immigrants between 1840 and 1930.\n\nThe upper [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] valley area was once part of the so-called [[Republic of Madawaska]], before the frontier was decided in the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. Over a quarter of the population of Lewiston, [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], and [[Biddeford]] are Franco-American. Most of the residents of the [[Mid Coast]] and [[Down East]] sections are chiefly of British heritage. Smaller numbers of various other groups, including [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]], have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century [[immigration]] waves.\n\n;Birth data\n''Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+Live births by single race/ethnicity of mother\n|-\n!

Aroostook County is known for its [[potato]] crops. [[Commercial fishing]], once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly [[lobster fishing|lobstering]] and [[groundfishing]]. While lobster is the main seafood focus for Maine, the harvest of both oysters and seaweed are on the rise. In 2015, 14% of the Northeast's total oyster supply came from Maine. In 2017, the production of Maine's seaweed industry was estimated at $20 million per year. The shrimp industry of Maine is on a government-mandated hold. With an ever-decreasing Northern shrimp population, Maine fishermen are no longer allowed to catch and sell shrimp. The hold began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2021.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Losneck|first=Caroline|date=April 2019|title=\"NORTHEAST: Oyster, seaweed industries continue rise in Maine; Northern shrimp shutdown extends 3 years; scup and squid try to find strong markets.\"|url=|journal=National Fisherman|volume=|pages=|via=UMA Library}}</ref> Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water.\n\nMaine's industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper, lumber and wood products, electronic equipment, leather products, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Naval shipbuilding and construction remain key as well, with [[Bath Iron Works]] in Bath and [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in Kittery.\n\nBrunswick Landing, formerly [[Naval Air Station Brunswick]], is also in Maine. Formerly a large support base for the U.S. Navy, the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] campaign initiated the Naval Air Station's closing, despite a government-funded effort to upgrade its facilities. The former base has since been changed into a civilian business park, as well as a new satellite campus for [[Southern Maine Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrra.us/brunswick-landing/|title=Brunswick Landing\u2014Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|author=|date=|website=Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaine is the number one U.S. producer of low-bush [[blueberry|blueberries]] ([[Vaccinium angustifolium]]). Preliminary data from the [[USDA]] for 2012 also indicate Maine was the largest blueberry producer of the major blueberry producing states, with 91,100,000 lbs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/ers/blueberry/table02.xls|title=Data|website=usda.mannlib.cornell.edu}}</ref> This data includes both low (wild), and high-bush (cultivated) blueberries: [[Vaccinium corymbosum]]. The largest toothpick manufacturing plant in the United States used to be located in [[Strong, Maine]]. The Strong Wood Products plant produced 20 million toothpicks a day. It closed in May 2003.\n\nTourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine's economy. The state is a popular destination for sport [[hunting]] (particularly deer, moose and bear), [[sport fishing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[skiing]], boating, [[camping]] and [[hiking]], among other activities.\n\nHistorically, Maine ports played a key role in national transportation. Beginning around 1880, Portland's rail link and [[ice-free port]] made it Canada's principal winter port, until the aggressive development of [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, in the mid-1900s. In 2013, 12,039,600 [[short tons]] passed into and out of Portland by sea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/wcsc/webpub13/Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|title=Part1_Ports_tonsbycommCY2013.htm|website=www.navigationdatacenter.us}}</ref> which places it 45th of U.S. water ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_57.html|title=Table 1-57: Tonnage of Top 50 U.S. Water Ports, Ranked by Total Tons(a)\u2014Bureau of Transportation Statistics|website=www.rita.dot.gov}}</ref> Portland Maine's [[Portland International Jetport]] was recently expanded, providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as [[JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]].\n\nMaine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state, and that number has fallen due to consolidations and mergers, particularly in the [[pulp and paper industry]]. Some of the larger companies that do maintain headquarters in Maine include [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in South Portland; [[IDEXX Laboratories]], in Westbrook; [[Hannaford Bros. Co.]] in Scarborough; [[TD Banknorth|TD Bank]] in Portland; [[L.L.Bean]] in Freeport; and [[Cole Haan]] in Yarmouth. Maine is also the home of the [[Jackson Laboratory]], the world's largest non-profit mammalian genetic research facility and the world's largest supplier of genetically purebred mice.\n\n===Taxation===\n\n{{further|State tax levels in the United States}}\n\nMaine has an [[income tax]] structure containing two brackets, 6.5 and 7.95 percent of personal income.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2013/1040RateSched_13RevJan13.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Before July 2013 Maine had four brackets: 2, 4.5, 7, and 8.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maine.gov/revenue/forms/1040/2012/RateSched_12.pdf |title=Tax forms|website=maine.gov}}</ref> Maine's general [[sales tax]] rate is 5.5 percent.

All [[Real property|real]] and tangible [[personal property]] located in the state of Maine is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns, while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor.\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n\n{{Further|Bath Iron Works|Portsmouth Naval Shipyard}}\n\nMaine has a long-standing tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships. The main function of these ships was to transport either cargos or passengers overseas. One of these yards was located in [[Pennellville Historic District]] in what is now Brunswick, Maine. This yard, owned by the Pennell family, was typical of the many family-owned shipbuilding companies of the time period. Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Airports===\n\n[[File:KPWM Aerial Wiki.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portland International Jetport]]]]\n\nMaine receives [[Jet airliner|passenger jet]] service at its two largest airports, the [[Portland International Jetport]] in Portland, and the [[Bangor International Airport]] in Bangor. Both are served daily by many major [[airline]]s to destinations such as New York, [[Atlanta]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. [[Essential Air Service]] also subsidizes service to a number of smaller airports in Maine, bringing small [[turboprop]] aircraft to regional airports such as the [[Augusta State Airport]], [[Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport]], [[Knox County Regional Airport]], and the [[Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle]]. These airports are served by regional providers such as [[Cape Air]] with Cessna 402s, [[PenAir]] with Saab 340s, and [[CommutAir]] with Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.\n\nMany smaller airports are scattered throughout Maine, serving only [[general aviation]] traffic. The [[Eastport Municipal Airport]], for example, is a city-owned public-use airport with 1,200 general aviation aircraft operations each year from single-engine and ultralight aircraft.<ref>KEPM\u2014Eastport, Maine\u2014Eastport Municipal Airport\".

The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor).\n\nThe [[legislative branch]] is the [[Maine Legislature]], a bicameral body composed of the [[Maine House of Representatives]], with 151 members, and the [[Maine Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing laws.\n\nThe [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the [[Governor of Maine]] (currently [[Janet Mills]]). The Governor is elected every four years; no individual may serve more than two consecutive terms in this office. The current [[attorney general of Maine]] is [[Aaron Frey]]. As with other [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor.\n\nThe [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting state laws. The highest court of the state is the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]. The lower courts are the District Court, [[Maine Superior Court|Superior Court]] and Probate Court.

Maine has had two independent governors recently ([[James B. Longley]], 1975\u20131979 and current U.S. Senator [[Angus King]], 1995\u20132003). Maine state politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties.\n\nMaine is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].\n\nOn May 6, 2009, Maine became the fifth state to legalize [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|same-sex marriage]]; however, the law was repealed by voters on November 3, 2009. On November 6, 2012, Maine, along with Maryland and Washington, became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage at the ballot box.<ref>\"[https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/maine-gay-marriage-question-1-results_n_2050863.html Maine Passes Gay Marriage in Historic 'Question 1' Vote]\". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. November 7, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Federal politics===\n\nIn the 1930s, Maine was one of very few states which retained [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] sentiments. In the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of every state other than Maine and [[Vermont]]; these were the only two states in the nation that never voted for Roosevelt in any of his presidential campaigns, though Maine was closely fought in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] and [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. In the 1960s, Maine began to lean toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], especially in [[President of the United States|presidential]] elections. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine, perhaps because of the presence of his running mate, Maine Senator [[Edmund Muskie]], although the state voted Republican in every presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s.\n[[File:United States presidential election in Maine, 2016.svg|thumb|left|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]\n\nSince 1969, two of Maine's four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except [[Nebraska]] gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. Maine split its electoral vote for the first time in 2016, with Donald Trump's strong showing in the more rural central and northern Maine allowing him to capture one of the state's four votes in the Electoral College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/08/mainers-take-matters-into-their-own-hands-after-bitter-presidential-campaign/|title=Trump takes 1 of Maine's 4 electoral votes, in a first for the state|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ross Perot]] achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. In 1992, as an [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]], Perot came in second to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]], despite the long-time presence of the [[Bush family]] summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]]. In 1996, as the nominee of the [[Reform Party (United States)|Reform Party]], Perot did better in Maine than in any other state.\n\nMaine has voted for Democratic Bill Clinton twice, [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], [[John Kerry]] in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]] won one of Maine's electoral votes with Democratic opponent [[Hillary Clinton]] winning the other three. Although Democrats have mostly carried the state in presidential elections in recent years, Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, with Edmund Muskie, [[William Hathaway]] and [[George J. Mitchell]] being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U.S. Senate in the past fifty years.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made major gains in Maine. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. However, in the 2012 elections Democrats managed to recapture both houses of [[Maine Legislature]].\n\nMaine's U.S. senators are Republican [[Susan Collins]] and [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] Angus King. The governor is Democrat [[Janet Mills]]. The state's two members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are Democrats [[Chellie Pingree]] and \n[[Jared Golden]].\n\nMaine is the first state to have introduced ranked-choice voting in federal elections.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html|title = Maine Adopts Ranked-Choice Voting.

The governmental format of most organized towns and [[Plantation (Maine)|plantations]] is the town meeting, while the format of most cities is the council-manager form. {{as of|2013}} the organized municipalities of Maine consist of 23 [[List of cities in Maine|cities]], 431 [[List of towns in Maine|towns]], and 34 [[List of plantations in Maine|plantations]]. Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state's territory. Maine also has three Reservations: [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Indian Island]], Indian Township Reservation, and Pleasant Point Indian Reservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/local/|title=Maine.gov: Local|author=|date=|website=maine.gov|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* The largest municipality in Maine, by population, is the city of Portland (pop. 66,318).\n* The smallest city by population is Eastport (pop. 1,331).\n* The largest town by population is Brunswick (pop. 20,278).\n* The smallest town by population is [[Frye Island, Maine|Frye Island]], a resort town which reported zero year-round population in the 2000 Census; one plantation, [[Glenwood Plantation, Maine|Glenwood Plantation]], also reported a permanent population of zero.\n* In the 2000 census, the smallest town aside from Frye Island was [[Centerville, Maine|Centerville]] with a population of 26, but since that census, Centerville voted to disincorporate and therefore is no longer a town. The next smallest town with a population listed in that census is [[Beddington, Maine|Beddington]] (pop. 50 at the 2010 census).\n* The largest municipality by land area is the town of [[Allagash, Maine|Allagash]], at {{convert|128|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n* The smallest municipality by land area is [[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan Island]], at {{convert|0.86|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The smallest municipality by area that is not an island is [[Randolph, Maine|Randolph]], at {{convert|2.23|sqmi|km2|0}}.\n\n===Unorganized territory===\n\n[[Unorganized territory]] (UT) has no local government. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds. The unorganized territory of Maine consists of more than 400 townships (towns are incorporated, townships are unincorporated), plus many coastal islands that do not lie within any municipal bounds.

This film marked Carl Weathers' final appearance in the series. Its success led to a [[Rocky V|fifth entry]] released on November 16, 1990. The events of this film serve as the backstory to the plot of ''[[Creed II]]'', where Apollo Creed's son, [[Donnie Creed|Donnie]], is challenged to fight Drago's son, Viktor.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter having reclaimed the world championship title, Rocky Balboa plans to retire and spend time with his family. In 1985, Ivan Drago, a Soviet boxer, arrives in the United States with his wife, Ludmilla, a Soviet swimmer and a team of trainers from the Soviet Union and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations, but agrees to train Apollo despite his misgivings about the match.\n\nDuring a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The [[Exhibition fight|boxing exhibition]] takes place at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>Block, Marcelline (2011). ''World Film Locations: Las Vegas''. Intellect Books. Pages 40\u201341. {{ISBN|9781841505886}}.</ref> Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with [[James Brown]] performing \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers|Duke]], plead with him to give up, but a battered Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \"no matter what.\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to throw in the towel. Rocky honors Apollo\u2019s wishes, which allows Drago to land one final punch on Apollo, knocking him out and killing him. In the aftermath, Drago displays no sense of contrition, commenting to the assembled media: \"If he dies, he dies.\"\n\nEnraged by guilt and the Soviets' cold indifference, Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, vacating the title in order to do so. Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the U.S. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogourbinsk]] with only Duke and brother-in-law Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of [[anabolic steroids]]. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in hip-deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor.\n\nBefore the match, Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]]  and the [[Politburo]] in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man and not a machine as he\u2019s been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \"weak\" American.\n\nThe two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. His resilience and determination rallies the previously hostile Soviet crowd to his side. After being berated by Koloff, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing Gorbachev, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky initially takes more punishment, then seizes an opening and unleashes a series of vicious blows to defeat Drago by knockout.\n\nRocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging that the local crowd's disdain of him had turned to mutual respect during the fight. Rocky finally declares, \"If I can change and you can change, everybody can change!\" The Soviet premier stands up and reluctantly applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son watching the match on TV a Merry Christmas, and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": Beloved Heavyweight Champion of the World\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's wife and support through his boxing career.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's friend and brother-in-law.\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: Former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and close friend to Rocky\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as [[Ivan Drago|Captain Ivan Drago]]: the Soviets' prize Champion boxer and a Soviet Army infantry captain\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Ludmilla Vobet Drago|Ludmilla Vobet Drago]]: Wife and supporter of Ivan Drago, and olympic female swimming champion.\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]: Apollo's father-figure, friend, trainer and manager, who becomes Rocky's trainer for his match against Drago.\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Nicolai Koloff|Nicolai Koloff]]: Trainer, promoter, and manager of Ivan Drago.\n*Rocky Krakoff as Rocky Jr.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rocky IV (1985) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/fullcredits|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n* David Lloyd Austin as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]\n\n[[LeRoy Neiman]] plays the ring announcer in the Creed-Drago match.

The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in [[Jackson Hole]], and [[Grand Teton National Park]] was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The [[PNE Agrodome]] at [[Hastings Park]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.\n\nSylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to [[Saint John's Health Center|Saint John's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Santa Monica]], and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing.<ref name=\"AICN\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 | title=Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher=AICN |accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo-vs.-Drago \"exhibition\" fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring, and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.<ref name=\"AICN\"/>\n\n''Rocky IV'' is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new [[special effects]].<ref>{{cite journal |title='It's in the game': sport fans, film and digital gaming |first=G. |last=Crawford |journal=Sport in Society |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=130\u2013145 |doi=10.1080/17430430701823380 }}</ref> The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Von Hoff |first=D. |title=Rocky IV-Fight Medicine |journal=Medical Grand Rounds Presented at University of Texas Health Science Centre }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Boxing and Medicine |first=R.

Conti, who was too busy with the first two ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]'' films at the time, would return for ''[[Rocky V]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. Conti's famous piece of music from the Rocky series, \"[[Gonna Fly Now]]\", does not appear at all in ''Rocky IV'' (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola's training montage instrumental.\n\nSongs from the movie included \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", by [[James Brown]], and also music by [[John Cafferty]] (\"[[Heart's on Fire (John Cafferty song)|Heart's on Fire]]\", featuring Vince DiCola), [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], [[Kenny Loggins]], and [[Robert Tepper]].

Rocky's best friend [[Apollo Creed]] decides to fight him instead but is fatally beaten in the ring. Enraged, Rocky decides to fight Drago in the Soviet Union to avenge the death of his friend and defend the honor of his country.\n\nCritical reception was mixed, but the film was a huge success at the box office, earning $300 million. This film marked Carl Weathers' final appearance in the series. Its success led to a [[Rocky V|fifth entry]] released on November 16, 1990. The events of this film serve as the backstory to the plot of ''[[Creed II]]'', where Apollo Creed's son, [[Donnie Creed|Donnie]], is challenged to fight Drago's son, Viktor.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter having reclaimed the world championship title, Rocky Balboa plans to retire and spend time with his family. In 1985, Ivan Drago, a Soviet boxer, arrives in the United States with his wife, Ludmilla, a Soviet swimmer and a team of trainers from the Soviet Union and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations, but agrees to train Apollo despite his misgivings about the match.\n\nDuring a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The [[Exhibition fight|boxing exhibition]] takes place at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>Block, Marcelline (2011). ''World Film Locations: Las Vegas''. Intellect Books. Pages 40\u201341. {{ISBN|9781841505886}}.</ref> Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with [[James Brown]] performing \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers|Duke]], plead with him to give up, but a battered Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \"no matter what.\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to throw in the towel. Rocky honors Apollo\u2019s wishes, which allows Drago to land one final punch on Apollo, knocking him out and killing him. In the aftermath, Drago displays no sense of contrition, commenting to the assembled media: \"If he dies, he dies.\"\n\nEnraged by guilt and the Soviets' cold indifference, Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, vacating the title in order to do so. Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the U.S. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogourbinsk]] with only Duke and brother-in-law Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of [[anabolic steroids]]. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in hip-deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor.\n\nBefore the match, Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]]  and the [[Politburo]] in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man and not a machine as he\u2019s been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \"weak\" American.\n\nThe two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. His resilience and determination rallies the previously hostile Soviet crowd to his side. After being berated by Koloff, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing Gorbachev, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky initially takes more punishment, then seizes an opening and unleashes a series of vicious blows to defeat Drago by knockout.\n\nRocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging that the local crowd's disdain of him had turned to mutual respect during the fight. Rocky finally declares, \"If I can change and you can change, everybody can change!\" The Soviet premier stands up and reluctantly applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son watching the match on TV a Merry Christmas, and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": Beloved Heavyweight Champion of the World\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's wife and support through his boxing career.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's friend and brother-in-law.\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: Former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and close friend to Rocky\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as [[Ivan Drago|Captain Ivan Drago]]: the Soviets' prize Champion boxer and a Soviet Army infantry captain\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Ludmilla Vobet Drago|Ludmilla Vobet Drago]]: Wife and supporter of Ivan Drago, and olympic female swimming champion.\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]: Apollo's father-figure, friend, trainer and manager, who becomes Rocky's trainer for his match against Drago.\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Nicolai Koloff|Nicolai Koloff]]: Trainer, promoter, and manager of Ivan Drago.\n*Rocky Krakoff as Rocky Jr.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rocky IV (1985) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/fullcredits|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n* David Lloyd Austin as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]\n\n[[LeRoy Neiman]] plays the ring announcer in the Creed-Drago match.

The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in [[Jackson Hole]], and [[Grand Teton National Park]] was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The [[PNE Agrodome]] at [[Hastings Park]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.\n\nSylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to [[Saint John's Health Center|Saint John's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Santa Monica]], and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing.<ref name=\"AICN\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 | title=Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher=AICN |accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo-vs.-Drago \"exhibition\" fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring, and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.<ref name=\"AICN\"/>\n\n''Rocky IV'' is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new [[special effects]].<ref>{{cite journal |title='It's in the game': sport fans, film and digital gaming |first=G. |last=Crawford |journal=Sport in Society |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=130\u2013145 |doi=10.1080/17430430701823380 }}</ref> The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Von Hoff |first=D. |title=Rocky IV-Fight Medicine |journal=Medical Grand Rounds Presented at University of Texas Health Science Centre }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Boxing and Medicine |first=R.

Cal. 1989)</ref>  Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for ''Rocky IV'' on [[Spec script|spec]]; after the studio decided not to buy his treatment, he sued when the resulting movie script was similar to his treatment. The court held that Anderson had prepared an unauthorized [[derivative work]] of the characters Stallone had developed in ''Rocky I'' through ''III'', and thus he could not enforce his unauthorized story extension against the owner of the character's copyrights.\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main article|Rocky IV (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''Rocky IV'' was composed by [[Vince DiCola]], who would later compose the music for ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. ''Rocky IV'' is the only film in the series not to feature original music by [[Bill Conti]], who was replaced by DiCola; however, it does feature arrangements of themes composed by Conti from previous films in the series, such as \"The Final Bell\". Conti, who was too busy with the first two ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]'' films at the time, would return for ''[[Rocky V]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. Conti's famous piece of music from the Rocky series, \"[[Gonna Fly Now]]\", does not appear at all in ''Rocky IV'' (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola's training montage instrumental.\n\nSongs from the movie included \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", by [[James Brown]], and also music by [[John Cafferty]] (\"[[Heart's on Fire (John Cafferty song)|Heart's on Fire]]\", featuring Vince DiCola), [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], [[Kenny Loggins]], and [[Robert Tepper]].

A brutal face of the actor playing a so-called \"Soviet boxer\" frightened me. When he had killed an American Negro athlete in the ring, I ran into my bedroom, threw myself on the bed and cried. I was offended that this film portrays our country so falsely and cruelly\u2026\n\nThe next day, in a television interview, I said: \"In the film \"Rocky IV\", which is shown on American television, there is not a word of truth about the Soviet Union.
