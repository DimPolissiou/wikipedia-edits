That was the birth of public education in the well-known cultural and historical city, [[Prizren]]. \"The history of our education is a story of war, of efforts. A story of a small number of people, with a great spiritual world, and with a great will to be independent.\"<ref>Avzi Mustafa, Figura mesuesish shqiptar, Tetove, 1995, p.103</ref> \n\nThe schools closed during the [[Kosovo War|war in Kosovo]] in the 1990s. Classes were held in private houses. After the war ended school resumed, and from 1999 to 2007 education was brought back in two stages:\n\n# '''The emergency stage''' (1999-2002) - In this stage, the primary aim was rebuilding the educational system, including the school infrastructure. New schools were built, old ones repaired. \n# '''The development stage''' (2002-2007) - The stage of development and implementation of reforms in education. Teachers were trained for general and professional high schools, and new textbooks were published. \n\nNow, after many years of development, Prizren's educational system follows basic principles similar to other European states. The students come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds: Albanian, Bosnian, Turks, Romes and Ashkali.

We can find the beginning of activities during the 70s year, XIX. In 1907, Kosovo's Serbs, with the help of the Serbian and Russian government, opened a secondary school. In November 1912, this secondary school became a general high school. Classes stopped during the First World War, but in 1919, the school started again, and in 1924 it was made a full general school. From 1919 to 1941, classes were taught in Serbian. Teaching in Albanian began on November 11, 1942. During the Kosovo War, like all the other schools at the gymnasium level, teaching continued in Serbian and Turkish. Studies in Albanian continued in private houses until the war ended. Since 1999, classes have been taught in three languages: Albanian, Bosnian and Turkish. Now there are 1980 students in the school, and 500 in separated schools, and 106 teachers. 38 classes learn in Albanian, seven in Bosnian, and six in Turkish.<ref name=\"FEK1\"/>\n\nThe school can be separated into three education fields:\n\n* General fields;\n* Natural sciences;\n* Mathematics and computing science.\n\nOther than the main building, the \"Gjon Buzuku\" gymnasium is branched out into three different schools. \n\n# in Romaj\u00eb, seven classes, 250 students, two managements: general field and social field;\n# in Gjonaj, six classes, 80 students, two managements: general field and natural sciences field;\n# in Re\u00e7an, three classes, natural sciences field.\n\nThe school council is made up of senior students in addition to the rector, deputy director and administrator.\n\n=====\"Remzi Ademaj\" high school=====\n\"Remzi Ademaj\" is a general high school.

It was made an independent school by the decision of the municipality on June 30, 1964. In 1990 the final ethnic separation occurred, and students and teachers moved from the school territory for political reasons. After the Kosovo War (October 16, 1999), Albanians moved back to the school. Besides the Albanian language, the lectures in \"Luciano Motroni\" school were held in the Bosnian and Turkish language.

In 1948 it became a music high school. At that time, there were few teachers of music. The ministry of culture of Serbia sent the professor of the music academy, Josip Sllavenski to see if conditions were right to found a musical school. When Sllavenski arrived in Prizren, he met the musicians of the city. A day after that, he went to Zhur, and than he heard an instrumentalist group playing, and saw a group playing folk dance. He contacted Lorenc Antoni and wrote a letter to the Serbian culture ministry, to let the school open. The first director of the school was Lorenc Antoni, one of the best Albanian artists, after whom it is named.<ref name=\"FEK2\"/>\n\n===Religious high schools===\n\n=====Madrasah \"Alauddin\"=====\n\nThe madrasah \"Alauddin\" started its work based on the plan from the Islamic community (KBI).

That was the birth of public education in the well-known cultural and historical city, [[Prizren]]. \"The history of our education is a story of war, of efforts. A story of a small number of people, with a great spiritual world, and with a great will to be independent.\"<ref>Avzi Mustafa, Figura mesuesish shqiptar, Tetove, 1995, p.103</ref> \n\nThe schools closed during the [[Kosovo War|war in Kosovo]] in the 1990s. Classes were held in private houses. After the war ended school resumed, and from 1999 to 2007 education was brought back in two stages:\n\n# '''The emergency stage''' (1999-2002) - In this stage, the primary aim was rebuilding the educational system, including the school infrastructure. New schools were built, old ones repaired. \n# '''The development stage''' (2002-2007) - The stage of development and implementation of reforms in education. Teachers were trained for general and professional high schools, and new textbooks were published. \n\nNow, after many years of development, Prizren's educational system follows basic principles similar to other European states. The students come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds: Albanian, Bosnian, Turks, Romes and Ashkali. Classes are taught in three languages: Albanian, Bosnian and Turkish, in public and private institutions.\n\n==Early education==\n\n[[File:FLUTURAT.jpg|thumb|The children of the \"Fluturat\" kindergarten.]]\n\nEarly education is known as preschool or pre-primary education. Based on the age of the child, there are two kinds of preschool institutions:\n* preschools for children 1\u20133 years old;\n* preschools for children 3\u20136 years old.\n\nPre-primary schools are for children 5\u20136 years old. Preschools are private institutions, unlike the pre-primary that are usually part of primary education schools. 56 pre-primary children's groups exist in Prizen. There are 1466 children, of them 667 males, and 799 females. 1173 Albanians, 144 Bosnian, 34 Ashkali, 21 Romes and 94 Turks.\n\n==Primary and lower secondary education==\nPrimary and lower secondary education includes compulsory education for nine years, in two levels: \n*primary education (grades 1-5);\n*lower secondary education (grades 6-9).\nIn Prizren there are 72 primary and lower secondary schools. 47 of them are basic schools, and 25 are separated. 49 schools are taught in Albanian, 11 in Bosnian, and 12 in other languages. \n\nThere are 1250+ classes, with nearly 27,000 students. 14,000 of them are males, and 13,000 females. 2610 of them are in the first year, 2674 in the second year, 2812 in the third year, 2862 in the fourth year, 3109 in the fifth year, 3335 in the sixth year, 3315 in the seventh year, 2813 in the eighth year, and 3052 in the ninth year.

In Prizren there are six basic secondary schools and six separated secondary schools. Based on language, six schools are in Albanian, one Bosnian, and five others. There are 9608 students, 5261 males, 4347 females. In the first year there are 1667 males, and 1208 females. The second year has 1360 males and 1286 females. In the third year there are 1213 males, 1194 females, and in the fourth year 1021 males and 659 females. There are 287 classes, with 33,5 students in a class. Based on ethnicity, 8135 are Albanians, 975 Bosnian and 498 Turks. 43.1% of them are in general high schools, and 56.9% professional high schools.\n\n===Public high schools===\n\n====General high schools====\n\n=====\"Gjon Buzuku\" high school=====\n[[File:Gjimnazi Gjon Buzuku.jpg|thumb|The building of the \"Gjon Buzuku\" high school, pre-Kosovo War.]]\n\n[[File:Gjon Buzuku.png|thumb|The \"Gjon Buzuku\" building, post-war.]]\n\n\"Gjon Buzuku\" is a general high school with a long tradition. We can find the beginning of activities during the 70s year, XIX. In 1907, Kosovo's Serbs, with the help of the Serbian and Russian government, opened a secondary school. In November 1912, this secondary school became a general high school. Classes stopped during the First World War, but in 1919, the school started again, and in 1924 it was made a full general school. From 1919 to 1941, classes were taught in Serbian. Teaching in Albanian began on November 11, 1942. During the Kosovo War, like all the other schools at the gymnasium level, teaching continued in Serbian and Turkish. Studies in Albanian continued in private houses until the war ended. Since 1999, classes have been taught in three languages: Albanian, Bosnian and Turkish. Now there are 1980 students in the school, and 500 in separated schools, and 106 teachers. 38 classes learn in Albanian, seven in Bosnian, and six in Turkish.\n\nThe school can be separated into three education fields:\n\n* General fields;\n* Natural sciences;\n* Mathematics and computing science.\n\nOther than the main building, the \"Gjon Buzuku\" gymnasium is branched out into three different schools. \n\n# in Romaj\u00eb, seven classes, 250 students, two managements: general field and social field;\n# in Gjonaj, six classes, 80 students, two managements: general field and natural sciences field;\n# in Re\u00e7an, three classes, natural sciences field.\n\nThe school council is made up of senior students in addition to the rector, deputy director and administrator.\n\n=====\"Remzi Ademaj\" high school=====\n\"Remzi Ademaj\" is a general high school. It was a part of \"Gjon Buzuku\" general high school, but has recently separated. It has two managements:\n# Social sciences field;\n# Languages field.\n\n====Professional high schools====\n\n=====\"11 Marsi\" technical high school=====\n[[File:I patitulluar.png|thumb|A practice work made by one of the technical school \"11 Marsi\" students.]]\n\n[[File:I patitulluar1.png|thumb|The computer cabinet of the 11 Marsi school.]]\n\nThe technical high school \"11 Marsi\" in Prizren was founded in 1967. The first course that was taught there was construction. Classes were in Albanian until 1991. Due to war during the 90s, school was held in private houses. Only after the end of the war could the students return to their regular school. The school has a total of 2210 students; ethnically 1357 (89,27%) are Albanian, 95 (6,25%) Bosnian, 52 (3,42%) Turks, 12 (0,79%) Romes, and four (0,27%) Ashkali. Lectures are held in three languages: 1397 students in Albanian, 77 students in Bosnian and 46 in Turkish. The school teaches in a variety of fields:\n*electronics:\n**computing;\n**electrician;\n**telecommunication;\n**audio and video.\n*machinery fields:\n**blacksmith;\n**installation of water and sewer;\n**installation of heating and air conditioning;\n**mechanic.\n*construction:\n**architecture;\n**geodesy.\n*applied arts:\n**textile design;\n**graphic design.\n*traffic\n**road traffic.\n\n=====\"Ymer Prizreni\" Economic High School=====\nThe economic high school \"Ymer Prizreni\" was founded in 1945 as a teachers' school. In 1956 it was named \"Dimitrie Tucovi\u0107\" and continued training teachers till 1974. For the next four years, it functioned as a normal school. In 1992 the school was designated as the \"Ymer Prizreni\" Economic High School. Now the school has 1708 students, 642 of them females and 1066 males. 1470 of them are Albanians, 184 Bosnian, 54 Turkish. The school has these education fields:   \n* economic fields:\n**accounting;\n**bank insurance;\n**retail and wholesale trade;\n**freight forwarder;\n**business administration.\n*law:\n**juristic assistant;\n**administration assistant.\n*food technology\n**plant-derived food technology.\n*hotels:\n**assistant restaurant.\n\n=====\"Luciano Motroni\" medical high school=====\n[[File:Luciano motoroni.jpg|thumb|The logo of the \"Luciano Motroni\" school.]]\n\n[[File:Luciano Motoroni 1.jpg|thumb|The building of the Luciano Motroni Medical High School.]]\n\nThe medical high school \"Luciano Motroni\" was created as part of the \"Gjon Buzuku\" Gymnasium. It was made an independent school by the decision of the municipality on June 30, 1964. In 1990 the final ethnic separation occurred, and students and teachers moved from the school territory for political reasons. After the Kosovo War (October 16, 1999), Albanians moved back to the school. Besides the Albanian language, the lectures in \"Luciano Motroni\" school were held in the Bosnian and Turkish language. Now the medical school \"Luciano Motroni\" teaches classes in these fields:\n*Medical (General)\n*Nurse\n*Fitness\n*Pediatrics\n*Pharmacy\n*Gynecology \n*Dentistry\n\n=====\"Lorenc Antoni\" music school=====\n\nThe musical school \"Lorenc Antoni\" was founded on 25 October 1947 as a primary education school. In 1948 it became a music high school. At that time, there were few teachers of music. The ministry of culture of Serbia sent the professor of the music academy, Josip Sllavenski to see if conditions were right to found a musical school. When Sllavenski arrived in Prizren, he met the musicians of the city. A day after that, he went to Zhur, and than he heard an instrumentalist group playing, and saw a group playing folk dance. He contacted Lorenc Antoni and wrote a letter to the Serbian culture ministry, to let the school open. The first director of the school was Lorenc Antoni, one of the best Albanian artists, after whom it is named.\n\n===Religious high schools===\n\n=====Madrasah \"Alauddin\"=====\n\nThe madrasah \"Alauddin\" started its work based on the plan from the Islamic community (KBI). This was the first madrasah to hold lectures in the Albanian language. The madrasah opened its first sections in Prizren in 1993, then later in Gjilan. During the period 1996/96 the madrasah had 132 students (in three years). During 1997/98 another section was opened for girls, with 25 students. Although the school was damaged by Serbian troops during the war, it reopened in June 1999. During these years of the madrasah's activity and until the end of 2009/10, 2750 people finished their studies.\n\n===Private high schools===\n\n====Mehmet Akif College====\nThe Mehmet Akif College was founded in February 2000 in Prishtina by a group of parents and educators to contribute to the education of Kosovo. The Prizren branch of the school was opened in the year 2006. It offers a challenging education to students focusing both on academic achievement and personal growth, regardless of religion, race, nationality or sex. More than 90% of the graduating seniors enter universities and institutions of higher learning worldwide. The Mehmet Akif College has a variety of extracurricular activities, clubs, sports, and field trips.

The studio is home to ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', the ''[[IHeartRadio]] Theater'', and was home to the [[Activision Blizzard|Blizzard]] [[eSports]] Arena (home of the ''[[Overwatch League]]'').\n\n==History==\n[[File:Radio City West.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Radio City West was located at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Los Angeles until it was replaced by a bank in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nThe West Coast Radio City opened in 1938 and served as headquarters to the [[NBC]] Radio Networks' West Coast operations. It served as a replacement for NBC's radio broadcast center in San Francisco, which had been in service since the network's formation in 1927. Since NBC never owned a radio station in Los Angeles, the network's West Coast programming originated from its San Francisco station (KPO, which later became KNBC, and is now [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]]).\n\nThe architect for the distinctive [[Streamline Moderne]] building at Sunset and Vine was [[John C. Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/company-histories/austin-company/incorporation-growing-businessin-early-1900s|title=International Directory of Company Histories-The Austin Company|publisher=International Directory of Company Histories|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1949, NBC launched its newest television station for Los Angeles, KNBH (Channel 4; now [[KNBC]]) from Radio City; the radio studios were later equipped for live television broadcasting in the transition phase from radio broadcasting. However, as television production was increasing for NBC, the network and its then-parent the [[Radio Corporation of America]], decided to build a television studio, nicknamed NBC Color City, that would be exclusively equipped for color television broadcasting. For many of the same reasons why CBS eventually built [[Television City]] in the early 1950s, the television facilities at Radio City gradually became too small for NBC to produce its television broadcasts.\n\nRCA's decision to expand television studio facilities required moving to the real estate market in the San Fernando Valley-Burbank area, with land purchased from [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]].<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/thomas-w-sarnoff</ref> The newly christened NBC Color City Studios opened in March 1955, as the first television studio designed specially for the origination of [[color television]] broadcasting, although their rivals, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] would gradually add color broadcasting to their studio facilities in the later years.\n\nKNBC moved to a new building in 1962. In 1964, the West Coast Radio City building was demolished, as NBC moved more of their West Coast television operations to the Burbank facility. The site is now occupied by a bank.\n\nThis studio hosted production of many of the best-remembered game and variety shows from the 1950s through the 1990s, including [[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in]] beginning in 1968 and ''The Tonight Show'' in 1972.    Both shows would frequently reference their home in \"Beautiful Downtown Burbank.\"  During the late 1960s, Carson's Tonight Show would move for periods to Burbank, using studio 1. After the permanent move to Burbank in 1972, Bob Hope's show taped in studio 1, with ''The Tonight Show'' taking a hiatus while Hope produced his specials\n\n''[[The Tonight Show]]'' would stay in Burbank until 2009, when it moved to an all-digital studio on the Universal lot in 2009 for the short-lived ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]].''  The show moved back to the Burbank Studios when Leno returned as host of ''The Tonight Show'' on March 1, 2010.  The show used studio 11 until Leno stepped down as host on February 6, 2014.  After that, ''The Tonight Show'' moved back to [[New York City]]'s Rockefeller Center when [[Jimmy Fallon]] replaced Leno as host, marking the end of the 42-year era in which the show had taped from Southern California.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|last=Memmott|first=Mark|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/04/03/176139405/its-set-jimmy-fallon-to-replace-jay-leno-on-tonight-show-in-spring-2014|title=It's Set: Jimmy Fallon To Replace Jay Leno On 'Tonight Show' In Spring 2014|date=3 April 2013|work=Must Reads|accessdate=2013-08-22|publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nOn October 2, 2017, Studio 1 became the official home of Blizzard Arena Los Angeles and the Overwatch League, marking Burbank Studios' very first eSports broadcast.

The studio is home to ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', the ''[[IHeartRadio]] Theater'', and was home to the [[Activision Blizzard|Blizzard]] [[eSports]] Arena (home of the ''[[Overwatch League]]'').\n\n==History==\n[[File:Radio City West.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Radio City West was located at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Los Angeles until it was replaced by a bank in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nThe West Coast Radio City opened in 1938 and served as headquarters to the [[NBC]] Radio Networks' West Coast operations. It served as a replacement for NBC's radio broadcast center in San Francisco, which had been in service since the network's formation in 1927. Since NBC never owned a radio station in Los Angeles, the network's West Coast programming originated from its San Francisco station (KPO, which later became KNBC, and is now [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]]).\n\nThe architect for the distinctive [[Streamline Moderne]] building at Sunset and Vine was [[John C. Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/company-histories/austin-company/incorporation-growing-businessin-early-1900s|title=International Directory of Company Histories-The Austin Company|publisher=International Directory of Company Histories|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1949, NBC launched its newest television station for Los Angeles, KNBH (Channel 4; now [[KNBC]]) from Radio City; the radio studios were later equipped for live television broadcasting in the transition phase from radio broadcasting. However, as television production was increasing for NBC, the network and its then-parent the [[Radio Corporation of America]], decided to build a television studio, nicknamed NBC Color City, that would be exclusively equipped for color television broadcasting. For many of the same reasons why CBS eventually built [[Television City]] in the early 1950s, the television facilities at Radio City gradually became too small for NBC to produce its television broadcasts.\n\nRCA's decision to expand television studio facilities required moving to the real estate market in the San Fernando Valley-Burbank area, with land purchased from [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]].<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/thomas-w-sarnoff</ref> The newly christened NBC Color City Studios opened in March 1955, as the first television studio designed specially for the origination of [[color television]] broadcasting, although their rivals, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] would gradually add color broadcasting to their studio facilities in the later years.\n\nKNBC moved to a new building in 1962. In 1964, the West Coast Radio City building was demolished, as NBC moved more of their West Coast television operations to the Burbank facility. The site is now occupied by a bank.\n\nThis studio hosted production of many of the best-remembered game and variety shows from the 1950s through the 1990s, including [[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in]] beginning in 1968 and ''The Tonight Show'' in 1972.    Both shows would frequently reference their home in \"Beautiful Downtown Burbank.\"  During the late 1960s, Carson's Tonight Show would move for periods to Burbank, using studio 1. After the permanent move to Burbank in 1972, Bob Hope's show taped in studio 1, with ''The Tonight Show'' taking a hiatus while Hope produced his specials\n\n''[[The Tonight Show]]'' would stay in Burbank until 2009, when it moved to an all-digital studio on the Universal lot in 2009 for the short-lived ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]].''  The show moved back to the Burbank Studios when Leno returned as host of ''The Tonight Show'' on March 1, 2010.  The show used studio 11 until Leno stepped down as host on February 6, 2014.  After that, ''The Tonight Show'' moved back to [[New York City]]'s Rockefeller Center when [[Jimmy Fallon]] replaced Leno as host, marking the end of the 42-year era in which the show had taped from Southern California.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|last=Memmott|first=Mark|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/04/03/176139405/its-set-jimmy-fallon-to-replace-jay-leno-on-tonight-show-in-spring-2014|title=It's Set: Jimmy Fallon To Replace Jay Leno On 'Tonight Show' In Spring 2014|date=3 April 2013|work=Must Reads|accessdate=2013-08-22|publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nOn October 2, 2017, Studio 1 became the official home of Blizzard Arena Los Angeles and the Overwatch League, marking Burbank Studios' very first eSports broadcast.

The network continued to develop through internal financing in a heavily regulated market as international technology developed.  At this point, telephone services were operated by the [[South African Post Office]].\n\nIn the 1960s, South Africa was connected to 72 nations and total outgoing annual international calls numbered over 28,800.\n\nIn the 1990s, South Africa launched its mobile operations, underwritten by Telkom in partnership with [[Vodafone]]. This subsidiary grew to be [[Vodacom]], which Telkom sold in late 2008 in preference for its own 3G network (established as 8ta, but now Telkom Mobile). [[Vodacom]] has a subscriber base of more than 45M, with an [[average revenue per user]] of more than R60 across both rural and urban subscribers. Vodacom, together with the other operators, have come under criticism in late 2009 by government and the public for high interconnect charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncf.org.za/docs/publications/consumerfair/vol2/complaint.htm |title=Are MTN and Vodacom profiteering at our expense?|accessdate=3 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520104355/http://www.ncf.org.za/docs/publications/consumerfair/vol2/complaint.htm |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}</ref> This issue is currently being discussed by the Parliamentary Committee on Telecommunications.\n\nIn 2004, the Department of Communications redefined the Electronics Communications Act, which consolidated and redefined the landscape of telecommunications licensing in South Africa (both mobile and fixed). The Independent Communications Authority (ICASA) currently licenses more than 400 independent operators with the Electronic Communications Network License (with the ability to self-provision) as well as issuing Electronic Communications Service Licenses for service deployment over infrastructure in the retail domain.\n\nTelkom is no longer the single operator in South Africa, and faces competition from the second Fixed Network Operator Licensee, [[Neotel]], as well as the three mobile operators, Vodacom, MTN and Cell-C. However, it still receives criticisms (see later) from smaller operators and the Competition Commission for setting South African broadband pricing in its favour.\n\n==Telkom group structure==\nTelkom SA is structured under Group CEO, Mr Sipho Maseko. The retail division, including Telkom Business, Telkom Mobile, Consumer Marketing, Cloud and IT Operations are run by Group Chief Operating Officer, Dr Brian Armstrong and its Wholesale and Networks division(OpenServe) is under MD Alphonso Samuels.\n\nCybernest focuses on Telkom's newly deployed DCO infrastructure in Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg, as well as services thereupon, including data hosting, LAN and application management and managing IT infrastructure for corporate and large business customers.\n\nTelkom acquired Business Connexion in September 2015 for approximately ZAR 2.7 billion with the strategic intent of obtaining a significant presence in the Information Technology (IT) market in South Africa. This was the second attempt at the acquisition by Telkom and was subject to a number of prescribed conditions set out by the competition authorities i.e. one of which was to ensure minimal impact on staff retrenchments. The integration of the two (2) organisations enabled a new and compelling value proposition to be offered to private and public business customers in the domestic market.\n\n[[Jeffrey Hedberg]] was appointed acting group chief executive officer on 7 July 2010 following Reuben September's resignation. Jeffrey was the CEO of [[Cell C]] from 2006 to 2009. However, on 13 January 2011, TechCentral reported that Hedberg would quit Telkom by the end of March 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techcentral.co.za/hedberg-to-quit-telkom/20339/ |title=Hedberg to quit Telkom |publisher=TechCentral |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> citing that he felt that he would not be given the mandate he needed to fix Telkom commercially and operationally.\n\nThe mandate to control Telkom's corporate (and business) strategy was managed by the South African Government \u2013 a Class-A shareholder in the privately listed Company. It is speculated that Government is intending Telkom \"to play a more active role in the rest of Africa\".

SBC has since sold its interest in the company, after reducing operational expenditure (reducing staff resources, etc.) and increasing [[revenue]] by increased product prices, thereby increasing the share-price for greater ROI.\n\nThe company is currently the market leader in the broadband space, with more than 500,000 customers on 2-40 Mbit/s DSL; it dominates the managed services market and has more than 250 corporate customers on its order book.

[[SEACOM (African cable system)|Seacom]] is a privately funded venture which built, owns, and operates a submarine fibre-optic cable connecting communication carriers in south and east Africa. SAT-3/WASC or South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable is a submarine communications cable linking Portugal and Spain to South Africa, with connections to several West African countries along the route. It forms part of the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE cable system, where the SAFE cable links South Africa to Asia.

Competitors to the land-line monopoly have flourished, with special note given to providers of [[wireless broadband]], who provide greater geographical penetration, by means of the technology used, than Telkom.  Examples of these providers include Sentech, an extension of the state-owned [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], and WBS Co., a [[Black Economic Empowerment|black owned]] enterprise. On 31 August 2006, [[Neotel]] (Second Network Operator) announced the launch of its services as the second national operator, initially offering wholesale international services, with plans to expand to business & residential customers within months. Neotel plans to initially use CDMA-2000 wireless technology for the last mile infrastructure due to the government and ICASA's (the regulator) inability and unwillingness to unbundle the local-loop, leading some to suggest that it's not much more than a cellular operator instead of the much needed competitor to Telkom.\n\nThe three mobile telephone networks in South Africa, listed in terms of numbers of subscribers, are [[Vodacom]] (currently 65% owned by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Vodafone]], but until November 2008 jointly with Telkom SA), [[MTN (South Africa)|MTN]] and [[Cell C]]. There are several service providers, such as Virgin Mobile and Nashua Mobile, which subscribers can use to access the networks.  There are approximately six times as many cellphone subscribers than land line subscribers in South Africa (30 million versus 5 million), and since these networks route their calls over their own network, [[GSM]] providers have taken a large chunk of Telkom's business, one reason for this is that many see Telkom as being an inept corporation, only interested in making money, failing to consider the customer.  This is a fine example of a monopoly that would, in true free market environments, soon fail.\n\nAnother promising technology is [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), which may decrease the number of calls made over the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) in the near future.  Telkom's international calling rates are already far undercut by VoIP providers.\n \nFinally, although the Government is taking steps to liberalise the market, laws regarding telecommunications are still quite restrictive relative to the United States and other developed nations.\n\nAn example of restrictive legislation is the Draft Convergence Bill, which attempts to control the development of such commerce.\nTelkom is currently under much fire from the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA), who accused it of excessive ADSL line charges.\n\n==Pan African operations==\n[[File:Entrance at Telkom (BCX) Hartebeesthoek Satellite Earth Station.jpg|thumb|Entrance at [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] ([[BCX (Business Connexion Group)|BCX]]) ''Hartebeesthoek Satellite Earth Station'']]\nTelkom operates in 38 countries in Africa, from regional hubs in Nigeria and Kenya via an integrated service provider strategy\n. It is expanding its service portfolio across managed voice, managed data, IT services & applications, and diversifying into new revenue growth opportunities in adjacent markets.\n\nRecent acquisitions of Kenyan ISP Africa Online, and Nigerian mobile operator Multi-Links gives Telkom strategic hubs to expand data and voice services into Africa.  Africa Online (AFOL) is a Pan African Internet Service Provider operating in eight countries with the 9th country through a joint-venture with Verizon South Africa. Multi-Links is a private telecommunications operator (as of 2009 a wholly owned Telkom subsidiary) with a Unified Access License allowing fixed, mobile, data, long-distance and international telecommunications services focused primarily on corporate clients in Nigeria.\n\nVia Africa Online, Telkom intends leveraging its international capacity to deploy satellite based Internet access. Through Multi-Links, Telkom is introducing converged fixed and mobile services to the Nigerian market.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===User Complaints===\nTelkom experiences a high volume of complaints on a daily basis (one of the highest in South Africa). Many customers in South Africa are dissatisfied with the level of service delivery. Many users indicate that if a new subscriber is looking for a service that they should turn to alternative sources as Telkom cannot deliver on their promises. FTTH is now available from several select service provides and will cut Telkom's last mile completely out of the connectivity loop.\n\n===Monopoly and state ownership===\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=October 2012}}\nHigh cost of Internet access is a major point of consumer frustration in South Africa. Telkom's monopoly, backed by government investment, over fixed line provision and international access is often pointed out as the primary reason for the high costs of telecommunications.<ref name=\"SACSIS\">{{cite web | url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/1264 | title=The ANC's ICT Techno-fix | publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service | date=11 April 2012 | accessdate=19 April 2012 | author=Duncan, Jane}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://m.news24.com/fin24/Finweek/Cover-Story/SAs-biggest-blunders-20110509 | title=SA\u2019s biggest blunders | publisher=News24 | date=12 May 2011 | accessdate=19 April 2012 | author=Whitfield, Bruce}}</ref> In light of the high cost of entry, many broadband users have settled for cellular alternatives instead. Telkom Mobile's current out-of-bundle data rate is R0.29 ($0.024) per MB.\n\nThe continuing monopoly of Telkom in South Africa's communications industry, and government's large stake in the company, have been perceived by the public, consumers, and the private sector{{By whom|date=November 2010}} as not being in the public's best interests. The South African telecommunications regulator ICASA is overburdened and restricted in its capabilities as handed down by the [[Department of Communications (South Africa)|Department of Communications]]. Telkom has a monopoly of all international calls originating within South Africa excluding VoIP, and of traffic over the [[SAT3]] cable that provides most of South Africa's international bandwidth. The indecision over the second network operator [[Neotel]], to Telkom's advantage, is also not considered to be in the public interest.\n\nTelkom has also attracted attention for improperly conducting itself in a contract dispute with [[Telcordia]] on account of non-delivery of an integrated FlowThru solution{{solution-inline|date=October 2019}}, resulting in a decision from the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] against its favor in which the judge described Telkom's legal team as conducting \"verbal manipulation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/bottomline.aspx?ID=BD4A327273 |title=Rob Rose\u2019s Monday Comment: In Harms' way: why judges' Telkom ruling sends shivers down the spine|accessdate=28 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104914/http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/bottomline.aspx?ID=BD4A327273 |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 January 2007, a full-page advertisement was taken out in The ''[[Mail and Guardian]]'', a national South African newspaper. Money for the ad was donated by dissatisfied South African individuals and businesses. The page was used as a public outcry, detailing some of the things Telkom has done, in hopes of bringing more attention to the current situation in South Africa's telecoms industry. The effort was organised by the [[Telecoms Action Group]], TAG.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===ADSL capping===\nPerhaps one of the biggest criticisms of Telkom was its introduction of a monthly traffic limit or \"cap\". According to Telkom, this was a measure instituted in order for the South African network not to become \"congested\" with an overflow of information. However, the general feeling in the South African ADSL community is that monthly traffic limits were strategically put in place by Telkom in order to obtain the maximum amount of money from ADSL users. This is mainly because Telkom offers extra bandwidth to users for a price. If the limit is exceeded during the course of the month, the ADSL connection is capped, denying international access to the web, while allowing access to local websites, until the end of the month. The user can purchase extra GBs after he/she is capped however. The typical monthly traffic limits can be used up in less than a day, even on low-speed lines.\n\n===Shaping===\n{{Main|Traffic shaping}}\nAnother major criticism of Telkom was its institution of port prioritization or \"shaping\". This also was a measure introduced by Telkom in order for networks throughout South Africa not to become congested with too much information. However, port prioritization was an idea conceived mainly to benefit businesses in which employees all shared the same internet connection. Employees who used \"bandwidth hogging\" applications such as [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) applications and network-intense [[online game]]s often slowed down the network dramatically, preventing users who wished to browse web pages or check their mail to do so in a short space of time. Port prioritization solves this problem as it prioritizes certain ports for certain applications. It works according to a protocol which includes all ports and applications generally used in conjunction with them. These ports are sorted into a list of sorts. At the top of the list appear web browsing and email. These ports and the applications which use them receive the most bandwidth from the network. At the very bottom of the list are peer to peer applications, online games and virtual private networking (VPN). These receive very little if not no bandwidth from the network. Being unable to establish international VPN connections on the standard package has a detrimental effect on international freelancers who must pay for the much more expensive 'unshaped' service. Although it is the ideal solution for large companies, there is no choice in the shaping matter. Personal connections to the internet also get shaped. This has caused an uproar in the South African P2P and online gaming community as one has to pay over exorbitant prices (roughly two times more) to get their connections \"unshaped.\"{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Fine===\n\nIn June 2013, Telkom accepted a R200 million fine to settle complaints that it used its dominant market position to block competition from other network providers.<ref>{{cite web| title=S.Africa's Telkom agrees to R200 mln internet fine| author=David Dolan| publisher=Reuters| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/14/safrica-telkom-idUSL5N0EQ1AZ20130614|  date=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hellkom]]\n* [[MyBroadband]]\n* [[Neotel]]\n* [[SAIX]] (The South African Internet Exchange)\n* [[South African Telephone Numbering Plan]]\n* [[South African Communication Landmarks]]\n* [[Leapeetswe Rapula Radiala Molotsane]], CEO from 2005-2008\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Telkom}}\n* {{official|http://www.telkom.co.za/ }}\n* [http://www.telkomsa.net/ Telkom Internet]\n* [http://www.do.co.za/ Do Broadband]\n* [http://mybroadband.co.za/news MyBroadband Website]\n* [http://www.telkom.co.za/portal/page?_pageid=554,72063&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&paramURL=/pls/portal/docs/page/news/telecomshistory.jsp Corporate History]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141426/http://www.carteblanche.co.za/Display/Display.asp?Id=3051 Carte Blanche Documentary on Telkom Costs]\n\n{{South African telecommunication companies}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{National Key Points navbox}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Telkom Sa}}\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the City of Tshwane]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Pretoria]]\n[[Category:South African brands]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use South African English|date=July 2012}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Telkom SA SOC Limited\n| logo = [[File:TelkomSA.svg|200px]]\n| type = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as = {{Jse|TKG}}\n| foundation = 1991 \u2013 [[Johannesburg]], [[Transvaal Province]], South Africa<br>1910 (''as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs'')\n| location = [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]], [[Gauteng]], South Africa\n| area_served = 38 countries\n| key_people = Sipho Maseko, [[Group CEO]]<br />Tsholofelo Molefe, Group [[CFO]]<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sharedata.co.za/data/006966/pdfs/TELKOM_ar_mar18.pdf |title=Telkom Integrated Report for the year ended 31 March 2018|date=31 March 2018|website=Sharedata|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n| assets = {{ubl|{{increase}}R36.417 billion (US${{To USD|36.417|ZAF}} billion, 2018)|R34.125 billion (US${{To USD|34.125|ZAF}} billion, 2017)<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\"/>}}\n| equity = {{ubl|{{increase}}R50.544 billion (US${{To USD|50.544|ZAF}} billion, 2018)|R48.049 billion (US${{To USD|48.049|ZAF}} billion, 2017)<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\"/>}}\n| num_employees = 18,286 (2018)<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\"/>\n| divisions = Telkom Consumer<br>Openserve<br>Telkom mobile\n| subsid = [[Business Connexion Group|BCX]] (100%)<br>Trudon t/a [[Yellow Pages]] (64.9%)<br>Gyro Group (100%)\n| module = \n| ISIN = ZAE000044897\n| industry = [[Telecommunication|Communications services]]\n| products = [[Telecommunications]]<br />[[Broadband|Wireless and wireline broadband services]]<br />[[Digital television]]<br />[[Managed services]]<br />[[Web hosting]]\n| revenue = {{ubl|{{increase}}[[South African rand|R]]41.018 billion (US${{To USD|41.018|ZAF}} billion, 2018)|R40.970 billion (US${{To USD|40.970|ZAF}} billion, 2017)<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\"/>}}\n| operating_income = {{ubl|{{decrease}}R4.939 billion (US${{To USD|4.939|ZAF}} billion, 2018)|R5.214 billion (US${{To USD|5.214|ZAF}} billion, 2017)<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\"/>}}\n| net_income = {{ubl|{{increase}}R32.156 billion (US${{To USD|32.156|ZAF}} billion, 2018)|R31.854 billion (US${{To USD|31.854|ZAF}} billion, 2017)<ref name=\"Mar18 Report\"/>}}\n| website = {{URL|www.telkom.co.za}}\n}}\n\n'''Telkom SA SOC Limited''' is a South African wireline and wireless [[telecommunications]] provider, operating in more than 38 countries across the African continent.

The network continued to develop through internal financing in a heavily regulated market as international technology developed.  At this point, telephone services were operated by the [[South African Post Office]].\n\nIn the 1960s, South Africa was connected to 72 nations and total outgoing annual international calls numbered over 28,800.\n\nIn the 1990s, South Africa launched its mobile operations, underwritten by Telkom in partnership with [[Vodafone]]. This subsidiary grew to be [[Vodacom]], which Telkom sold in late 2008 in preference for its own 3G network (established as 8ta, but now Telkom Mobile). [[Vodacom]] has a subscriber base of more than 45M, with an [[average revenue per user]] of more than R60 across both rural and urban subscribers. Vodacom, together with the other operators, have come under criticism in late 2009 by government and the public for high interconnect charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncf.org.za/docs/publications/consumerfair/vol2/complaint.htm |title=Are MTN and Vodacom profiteering at our expense?|accessdate=3 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520104355/http://www.ncf.org.za/docs/publications/consumerfair/vol2/complaint.htm |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}</ref> This issue is currently being discussed by the Parliamentary Committee on Telecommunications.\n\nIn 2004, the Department of Communications redefined the Electronics Communications Act, which consolidated and redefined the landscape of telecommunications licensing in South Africa (both mobile and fixed). The Independent Communications Authority (ICASA) currently licenses more than 400 independent operators with the Electronic Communications Network License (with the ability to self-provision) as well as issuing Electronic Communications Service Licenses for service deployment over infrastructure in the retail domain.\n\nTelkom is no longer the single operator in South Africa, and faces competition from the second Fixed Network Operator Licensee, [[Neotel]], as well as the three mobile operators, Vodacom, MTN and Cell-C. However, it still receives criticisms (see later) from smaller operators and the Competition Commission for setting South African broadband pricing in its favour.\n\n==Telkom group structure==\nTelkom SA is structured under Group CEO, Mr Sipho Maseko. The retail division, including Telkom Business, Telkom Mobile, Consumer Marketing, Cloud and IT Operations are run by Group Chief Operating Officer, Dr Brian Armstrong and its Wholesale and Networks division(OpenServe) is under MD Alphonso Samuels.\n\nCybernest focuses on Telkom's newly deployed DCO infrastructure in Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg, as well as services thereupon, including data hosting, LAN and application management and managing IT infrastructure for corporate and large business customers.\n\nTelkom acquired Business Connexion in September 2015 for approximately ZAR 2.7 billion with the strategic intent of obtaining a significant presence in the Information Technology (IT) market in South Africa. This was the second attempt at the acquisition by Telkom and was subject to a number of prescribed conditions set out by the competition authorities i.e. one of which was to ensure minimal impact on staff retrenchments. The integration of the two (2) organisations enabled a new and compelling value proposition to be offered to private and public business customers in the domestic market.\n\n[[Jeffrey Hedberg]] was appointed acting group chief executive officer on 7 July 2010 following Reuben September's resignation. Jeffrey was the CEO of [[Cell C]] from 2006 to 2009. However, on 13 January 2011, TechCentral reported that Hedberg would quit Telkom by the end of March 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techcentral.co.za/hedberg-to-quit-telkom/20339/ |title=Hedberg to quit Telkom |publisher=TechCentral |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> citing that he felt that he would not be given the mandate he needed to fix Telkom commercially and operationally.\n\nThe mandate to control Telkom's corporate (and business) strategy was managed by the South African Government \u2013 a Class-A shareholder in the privately listed Company.

On 31 August 2006, [[Neotel]] (Second Network Operator) announced the launch of its services as the second national operator, initially offering wholesale international services, with plans to expand to business & residential customers within months. Neotel plans to initially use CDMA-2000 wireless technology for the last mile infrastructure due to the government and ICASA's (the regulator) inability and unwillingness to unbundle the local-loop, leading some to suggest that it's not much more than a cellular operator instead of the much needed competitor to Telkom.\n\nThe three mobile telephone networks in South Africa, listed in terms of numbers of subscribers, are [[Vodacom]] (currently 65% owned by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Vodafone]], but until November 2008 jointly with Telkom SA), [[MTN (South Africa)|MTN]] and [[Cell C]]. There are several service providers, such as Virgin Mobile and Nashua Mobile, which subscribers can use to access the networks.  There are approximately six times as many cellphone subscribers than land line subscribers in South Africa (30 million versus 5 million), and since these networks route their calls over their own network, [[GSM]] providers have taken a large chunk of Telkom's business, one reason for this is that many see Telkom as being an inept corporation, only interested in making money, failing to consider the customer.  This is a fine example of a monopoly that would, in true free market environments, soon fail.\n\nAnother promising technology is [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), which may decrease the number of calls made over the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) in the near future.  Telkom's international calling rates are already far undercut by VoIP providers.\n \nFinally, although the Government is taking steps to liberalise the market, laws regarding telecommunications are still quite restrictive relative to the United States and other developed nations.\n\nAn example of restrictive legislation is the Draft Convergence Bill, which attempts to control the development of such commerce.\nTelkom is currently under much fire from the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA), who accused it of excessive ADSL line charges.\n\n==Pan African operations==\n[[File:Entrance at Telkom (BCX) Hartebeesthoek Satellite Earth Station.jpg|thumb|Entrance at [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] ([[BCX (Business Connexion Group)|BCX]]) ''Hartebeesthoek Satellite Earth Station'']]\nTelkom operates in 38 countries in Africa, from regional hubs in Nigeria and Kenya via an integrated service provider strategy\n. It is expanding its service portfolio across managed voice, managed data, IT services & applications, and diversifying into new revenue growth opportunities in adjacent markets.\n\nRecent acquisitions of Kenyan ISP Africa Online, and Nigerian mobile operator Multi-Links gives Telkom strategic hubs to expand data and voice services into Africa.  Africa Online (AFOL) is a Pan African Internet Service Provider operating in eight countries with the 9th country through a joint-venture with Verizon South Africa. Multi-Links is a private telecommunications operator (as of 2009 a wholly owned Telkom subsidiary) with a Unified Access License allowing fixed, mobile, data, long-distance and international telecommunications services focused primarily on corporate clients in Nigeria.\n\nVia Africa Online, Telkom intends leveraging its international capacity to deploy satellite based Internet access. Through Multi-Links, Telkom is introducing converged fixed and mobile services to the Nigerian market.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===User Complaints===\nTelkom experiences a high volume of complaints on a daily basis (one of the highest in South Africa). Many customers in South Africa are dissatisfied with the level of service delivery. Many users indicate that if a new subscriber is looking for a service that they should turn to alternative sources as Telkom cannot deliver on their promises. FTTH is now available from several select service provides and will cut Telkom's last mile completely out of the connectivity loop.\n\n===Monopoly and state ownership===\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=October 2012}}\nHigh cost of Internet access is a major point of consumer frustration in South Africa. Telkom's monopoly, backed by government investment, over fixed line provision and international access is often pointed out as the primary reason for the high costs of telecommunications.<ref name=\"SACSIS\">{{cite web | url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/1264 | title=The ANC's ICT Techno-fix | publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service | date=11 April 2012 | accessdate=19 April 2012 | author=Duncan, Jane}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://m.news24.com/fin24/Finweek/Cover-Story/SAs-biggest-blunders-20110509 | title=SA\u2019s biggest blunders | publisher=News24 | date=12 May 2011 | accessdate=19 April 2012 | author=Whitfield, Bruce}}</ref> In light of the high cost of entry, many broadband users have settled for cellular alternatives instead. Telkom Mobile's current out-of-bundle data rate is R0.29 ($0.024) per MB.\n\nThe continuing monopoly of Telkom in South Africa's communications industry, and government's large stake in the company, have been perceived by the public, consumers, and the private sector{{By whom|date=November 2010}} as not being in the public's best interests. The South African telecommunications regulator ICASA is overburdened and restricted in its capabilities as handed down by the [[Department of Communications (South Africa)|Department of Communications]]. Telkom has a monopoly of all international calls originating within South Africa excluding VoIP, and of traffic over the [[SAT3]] cable that provides most of South Africa's international bandwidth. The indecision over the second network operator [[Neotel]], to Telkom's advantage, is also not considered to be in the public interest.\n\nTelkom has also attracted attention for improperly conducting itself in a contract dispute with [[Telcordia]] on account of non-delivery of an integrated FlowThru solution{{solution-inline|date=October 2019}}, resulting in a decision from the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] against its favor in which the judge described Telkom's legal team as conducting \"verbal manipulation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/bottomline.aspx?ID=BD4A327273 |title=Rob Rose\u2019s Monday Comment: In Harms' way: why judges' Telkom ruling sends shivers down the spine|accessdate=28 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104914/http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/bottomline.aspx?ID=BD4A327273 |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 January 2007, a full-page advertisement was taken out in The ''[[Mail and Guardian]]'', a national South African newspaper. Money for the ad was donated by dissatisfied South African individuals and businesses. The page was used as a public outcry, detailing some of the things Telkom has done, in hopes of bringing more attention to the current situation in South Africa's telecoms industry. The effort was organised by the [[Telecoms Action Group]], TAG.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===ADSL capping===\nPerhaps one of the biggest criticisms of Telkom was its introduction of a monthly traffic limit or \"cap\". According to Telkom, this was a measure instituted in order for the South African network not to become \"congested\" with an overflow of information. However, the general feeling in the South African ADSL community is that monthly traffic limits were strategically put in place by Telkom in order to obtain the maximum amount of money from ADSL users. This is mainly because Telkom offers extra bandwidth to users for a price. If the limit is exceeded during the course of the month, the ADSL connection is capped, denying international access to the web, while allowing access to local websites, until the end of the month. The user can purchase extra GBs after he/she is capped however. The typical monthly traffic limits can be used up in less than a day, even on low-speed lines.\n\n===Shaping===\n{{Main|Traffic shaping}}\nAnother major criticism of Telkom was its institution of port prioritization or \"shaping\". This also was a measure introduced by Telkom in order for networks throughout South Africa not to become congested with too much information. However, port prioritization was an idea conceived mainly to benefit businesses in which employees all shared the same internet connection. Employees who used \"bandwidth hogging\" applications such as [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) applications and network-intense [[online game]]s often slowed down the network dramatically, preventing users who wished to browse web pages or check their mail to do so in a short space of time. Port prioritization solves this problem as it prioritizes certain ports for certain applications. It works according to a protocol which includes all ports and applications generally used in conjunction with them. These ports are sorted into a list of sorts. At the top of the list appear web browsing and email. These ports and the applications which use them receive the most bandwidth from the network. At the very bottom of the list are peer to peer applications, online games and virtual private networking (VPN). These receive very little if not no bandwidth from the network. Being unable to establish international VPN connections on the standard package has a detrimental effect on international freelancers who must pay for the much more expensive 'unshaped' service. Although it is the ideal solution for large companies, there is no choice in the shaping matter. Personal connections to the internet also get shaped. This has caused an uproar in the South African P2P and online gaming community as one has to pay over exorbitant prices (roughly two times more) to get their connections \"unshaped.\"{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Fine===\n\nIn June 2013, Telkom accepted a R200 million fine to settle complaints that it used its dominant market position to block competition from other network providers.<ref>{{cite web| title=S.Africa's Telkom agrees to R200 mln internet fine| author=David Dolan| publisher=Reuters| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/14/safrica-telkom-idUSL5N0EQ1AZ20130614|  date=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hellkom]]\n* [[MyBroadband]]\n* [[Neotel]]\n* [[SAIX]] (The South African Internet Exchange)\n* [[South African Telephone Numbering Plan]]\n* [[South African Communication Landmarks]]\n* [[Leapeetswe Rapula Radiala Molotsane]], CEO from 2005-2008\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Telkom}}\n* {{official|http://www.telkom.co.za/ }}\n* [http://www.telkomsa.net/ Telkom Internet]\n* [http://www.do.co.za/ Do Broadband]\n* [http://mybroadband.co.za/news MyBroadband Website]\n* [http://www.telkom.co.za/portal/page?_pageid=554,72063&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&paramURL=/pls/portal/docs/page/news/telecomshistory.jsp Corporate History]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141426/http://www.carteblanche.co.za/Display/Display.asp?Id=3051 Carte Blanche Documentary on Telkom Costs]\n\n{{South African telecommunication companies}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{National Key Points navbox}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Telkom Sa}}\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the City of Tshwane]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Pretoria]]\n[[Category:South African brands]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange]]\n", "name_user": "TelkomGroupSA", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added a sentence that more accurately describes the company.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom_(South_Africa)"}
