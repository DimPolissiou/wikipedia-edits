He did this in response to weaknesses exposed by China's defeat by Japan in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u20131895, not long after the [[First Opium War|First]] (1839\u20131842) and [[Second Opium War|Second]] (1856\u20131860) Opium Wars; this blow came as a major shock to the Chinese, because Japan had been regarded as a tributary state, was much smaller than China, and was regarded as inferior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pumin|first=Yin|title=The Defeat that Changed China's History - the First Sino-Japanese War of 1984 Altered China's Past and has Left the Nation in Reflection Ever since|publisher=Beijing Review|year=2014|isbn=|location=ProQuest|pages=}}</ref> China also fought France in the [[Sino-French War]] from 1884 to 1885. Moreover, the defeat of China by Japan led to a scramble for \"privileges\" in China by other foreign powers, notably by the [[German Empire]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], further awakening the conservatives.\n\nBefore the First Sino-Japanese War, China engaged in technological modernization only, buying modern weapons, ships, artillery, and building modern arsenals to produce these weapons, and only giving their soldiers modern weapons without institutional reform, all the while declining to reform the government or civil society according to western standards&nbsp;\u2013 unlike Japan, which adopted western-style government with a Parliament and completely reorganized its army along western lines.\n\nWith the help of certain senior officials of the Qing court who supported reform, [[Kang Youwei]] was permitted to speak with the Emperor, and his suggestions were enacted.<ref>{{cite book|title=The China Year Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q31EAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA572&dq=mohammedan+wei+kuang+tao#v=onepage&q=mohammedan%20wei%20kuang%20tao&f=false|year=1914|publisher=G.

Prince Duan wanted to expel foreigners completely from China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/ourwork/nsa/papers/China%20ReliefSm.pdf|title=The China Relief Expedition Joint Coalition Warfare in China Summer 1900|last=Leonhard|first=Robert R.|date=|page=13|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|accessdate=31 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206044959/http://www.jhuapl.edu/ourwork/nsa/papers/China%20ReliefSm.pdf|archive-date=6 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the edicts of reform, plans were made to forcefully remove Empress Dowager Cixi from power.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Yuan Shikai]] was supposed to kill [[Ronglu]] and take control of the military garrison at [[Tianjin|Tientsin]]. He was then intended to return to Beijing with the contingent and imprison the Empress Dowager; however, Yuan had previously promised his support to Ronglu and instead of killing him, told him of the plot. This led to the coup that ended the Hundred Days' Reform.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==End==\nOpposition to the reform was intense among the conservative ruling elite, who, condemning the announced reform as too radical, proposed instead a more moderate and gradualist course of change. With the aforementioned, tacit support of the political opportunist Yuan Shikai and the backing of conservatives, Empress Dowager Cixi engineered a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' on September 22, 1898, forcing the young, reform-minded Guangxu into seclusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> The emperor was put under [[house arrest]] within the Summer Palace until his death in 1908. Cixi then took over the government as [[regent]].\n\nThe Hundred Days' Reform ended with the rescinding of the new edicts and the execution of six of the reform's chief advocates, together known as the \"[[Six gentlemen of the Hundred Days' Reform|Six Gentlemen]]\" (\u620a\u620c\u516d\u541b\u5b50): [[Tan Sitong]], [[Kang Guangren]] (Kang Youwei's brother), [[Lin Xu]], [[Yang Shenxiu]], [[Yang Rui (reformer)|Yang Rui]] and [[:zh:\u5289\u5149\u7b2c|Liu Guangdi]]. The two principal leaders, [[Kang Youwei]] and his student [[Liang Qichao]], fled to [[Japan]] to found the [[Baohuang Hui]] (Protect the Emperor Society) and to work, unsuccessfully, for a constitutional monarchy in China. Another leader of the reform, [[Tan Sitong]], refused to flee and was arrested and executed.\n\nDuring the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 Generals [[Dong Fuxiang]], [[Ma Anliang]], and [[Ma Haiyan]] were called to Beijing and helped put an end to the reform movement along with [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.360doc.com/content/10/0526/12/1256060_29592130.shtml |title=\u8463\u798f\u7965\u4e0e\u897f\u5317\u9a6c\u5bb6\u519b\u9600\u7684\u7684\u6545\u4e8b - 360Doc\u4e2a\u4eba\u56fe\u4e66\u9986 |access-date=2014-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214121754/http://www.360doc.com/content/10/0526/12/1256060_29592130.shtml |archive-date=2018-12-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dong Fuxiang and the Muslim Gansu Army stationed in Beijing during the Hundred Days' Reform later participated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and became known as the [[Kansu Braves]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe court put into effect some reform measures a decade later, starting with Cixi's [[New Policies]]. These included the abolition of the [[Imperial Examination]] in 1905, educational and military modernization patterned after the model of Japan, and an experiment in constitutional and parliamentary government. The suddenness and ambitiousness of the reform effort actually hindered its success. One effect, to be felt for decades to come, was the establishment of the [[New Army]], which, in turn, gave rise to [[Warlord Era|warlordism]].\n\nOn the other hand, the failure of the reform movement gave great impetus to [[revolution]]ary forces within China. Changes within the establishment were seen to be largely hopeless, and the overthrow of the whole Qing government increasingly appeared to be the only viable way to save China. Such [[Anti-Qing sentiment|sentiments]] directly contributed to the success of the [[Wuchang Uprising]] in 1911, barely a decade later.\n\n[[Leo Tolstoy]] corresponded with [[Gu Hongming]] on the Hundred Day's Reform and agreed that the reform movement was ill-advised.<ref name=\"Lee2005\">{{cite book|author=Khoon Choy Lee|title=Pioneers of Modern China: Understanding the Inscrutable Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jlOQc8BumIC&pg=PA10&dq=Tolstoy+boxers#v=onepage&q=Tolstoy%20boxers&f=false|date=1 January 2005|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-256-618-8|pages=10\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Differing interpretations==\nViews of the Hundred Days' Reform have grown increasingly more complex and nuanced. The traditional view<ref>See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/276504/Hundred-Days-of-Reform|title=Hundred Days of Reform|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> portrayed the reformers as heroes and the conservative elites, particularly the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], as villains unwilling to reform because of their selfish interests.\n\n===Failure as Kang's responsibility===\nHowever, some historians in the late 20th century have taken views that are more favorable to the conservatives and less favorable to the reformers. In this view, [[Kang Youwei]] and his allies were hopeless dreamers unaware of the political realities in which they operated. This view argues that the conservative elites were not opposed to change and that practically all of the reforms that were proposed were eventually implemented.\n\nFor example, [[Sterling Seagrave]], in his book \"The Dragon Lady\", argues that there were several reasons why the reforms failed. Chinese political power at the time was firmly in the hands of the ruling Manchu nobility.

He was then intended to return to Beijing with the contingent and imprison the Empress Dowager; however, Yuan had previously promised his support to Ronglu and instead of killing him, told him of the plot. This led to the coup that ended the Hundred Days' Reform.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==End==\nOpposition to the reform was intense among the conservative ruling elite, who, condemning the announced reform as too radical, proposed instead a more moderate and gradualist course of change. With the aforementioned, tacit support of the political opportunist Yuan Shikai and the backing of conservatives, Empress Dowager Cixi engineered a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' on September 22, 1898, forcing the young, reform-minded Guangxu into seclusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> The emperor was put under [[house arrest]] within the Summer Palace until his death in 1908. Cixi then took over the government as [[regent]].\n\nThe Hundred Days' Reform ended with the rescinding of the new edicts and the execution of six of the reform's chief advocates, together known as the \"[[Six gentlemen of the Hundred Days' Reform|Six Gentlemen]]\" (\u620a\u620c\u516d\u541b\u5b50): [[Tan Sitong]], [[Kang Guangren]] (Kang Youwei's brother), [[Lin Xu]], [[Yang Shenxiu]], [[Yang Rui (reformer)|Yang Rui]] and [[:zh:\u5289\u5149\u7b2c|Liu Guangdi]]. The two principal leaders, [[Kang Youwei]] and his student [[Liang Qichao]], fled to [[Japan]] to found the [[Baohuang Hui]] (Protect the Emperor Society) and to work, unsuccessfully, for a constitutional monarchy in China. Another leader of the reform, [[Tan Sitong]], refused to flee and was arrested and executed.\n\nDuring the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 Generals [[Dong Fuxiang]], [[Ma Anliang]], and [[Ma Haiyan]] were called to Beijing and helped put an end to the reform movement along with [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.360doc.com/content/10/0526/12/1256060_29592130.shtml |title=\u8463\u798f\u7965\u4e0e\u897f\u5317\u9a6c\u5bb6\u519b\u9600\u7684\u7684\u6545\u4e8b - 360Doc\u4e2a\u4eba\u56fe\u4e66\u9986 |access-date=2014-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214121754/http://www.360doc.com/content/10/0526/12/1256060_29592130.shtml |archive-date=2018-12-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dong Fuxiang and the Muslim Gansu Army stationed in Beijing during the Hundred Days' Reform later participated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and became known as the [[Kansu Braves]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe court put into effect some reform measures a decade later, starting with Cixi's [[New Policies]]. These included the abolition of the [[Imperial Examination]] in 1905, educational and military modernization patterned after the model of Japan, and an experiment in constitutional and parliamentary government. The suddenness and ambitiousness of the reform effort actually hindered its success. One effect, to be felt for decades to come, was the establishment of the [[New Army]], which, in turn, gave rise to [[Warlord Era|warlordism]].\n\nOn the other hand, the failure of the reform movement gave great impetus to [[revolution]]ary forces within China. Changes within the establishment were seen to be largely hopeless, and the overthrow of the whole Qing government increasingly appeared to be the only viable way to save China. Such [[Anti-Qing sentiment|sentiments]] directly contributed to the success of the [[Wuchang Uprising]] in 1911, barely a decade later.\n\n[[Leo Tolstoy]] corresponded with [[Gu Hongming]] on the Hundred Day's Reform and agreed that the reform movement was ill-advised.<ref name=\"Lee2005\">{{cite book|author=Khoon Choy Lee|title=Pioneers of Modern China: Understanding the Inscrutable Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jlOQc8BumIC&pg=PA10&dq=Tolstoy+boxers#v=onepage&q=Tolstoy%20boxers&f=false|date=1 January 2005|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-256-618-8|pages=10\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Differing interpretations==\nViews of the Hundred Days' Reform have grown increasingly more complex and nuanced.

In this view, [[Kang Youwei]] and his allies were hopeless dreamers unaware of the political realities in which they operated. This view argues that the conservative elites were not opposed to change and that practically all of the reforms that were proposed were eventually implemented.\n\nFor example, [[Sterling Seagrave]], in his book \"The Dragon Lady\", argues that there were several reasons why the reforms failed. Chinese political power at the time was firmly in the hands of the ruling Manchu nobility. The highly xenophobic [[Iron hats]] faction dominated the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] and were seeking ways to expel all Western influence from China. When implementing reform, the [[Guangxu Emperor]] by-passed the Grand Council and appointed four reformers to advise him. These reformers were chosen after a series of interviews, including the interview of [[Kang Youwei]], who was rejected by the Emperor and had far less influence than Kang's later boasting would indicate. At the suggestion of the reform advisors, the [[Guangxu Emperor]] also held secret talks with former Japanese Prime Minister [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] with the aim of using his experience in the [[Meiji Restoration]] to lead China through similar reforms.\n\nIt has also been suggested, controversially, that [[Kang Youwei]] actually did a great deal of harm to the cause by his perceived arrogance in the eyes of the conservatives. Rumours about potential repercussions, many of them false, made their way to the Grand Council, and were one of the factors in their decision to stage a coup against the Emperor. Kang, like many of the reformers, grossly underestimated the reactionary nature of the vested interests involved.\n\nThe Emperor set about to enact his reforms largely bypassing the powerful Grand Council. The councillors, angry at the Emperor's actions and fearful of losing the political power they had, then turned to the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to remove the emperor from power. Many, though not all, of the reforms were cancelled.

It stars [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]  and [[Bipasha Basu]]  in the lead, with [[Johnny Lever]], [[Dalip Tahil]], Narendra Bedi and [[Sharat Saxena]] in supporting roles. The film is an adaptation of the 1992 American thriller ''[[Consenting Adults (1992 film)|Consenting Adults]]'', directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]].

They marry and reside in [[Switzerland]], where they meet another Indian couple: Vikram ([[Akshay Kumar]]) and Sonia ([[Bipasha Basu]]). The couples quickly become friends and decide to go on a Christmas vacation together to [[Mauritius]].\n\nDuring their vacation, Raj sees Vikram with another woman, kissing and looking intimate. At the same time, Sonia begins to try to seduce Raj, who rejects her. Vikram notices Raj looking at Sonia and casually talks to him about [[Swinging (sexual practice)|wife swapping]], this upsets Raj and an argument breaks out between the two men. However, a couple of days later, they resolve their issues and become friends again. On Vikram's birthday, the two men celebrate by getting drunk together, sharing bottles of alcohol. Once again, Vikram asks whether he could become Raj for one night, which Raj rebuffs, but still, both men end up in opposite houses.\n\nThe next day Raj wakes up to find a seminaked woman in bed and realizes he is in Vicky's house. After talking to Priya about the events from last night, he imagines Vicky was able to seduce and convince Priya to go ahead with his wife swapping and making passionate love throughout the night. After some time, Sonia is found Plastic Face, and Raj is accused of her murder since his fingerprints are found on the murder weapon - an alcohol bottle. Determined to prove his innocence, Raj manages to escape from the court and is chased by the [[Swiss]] police. He meets Priya, who eventually believes his innocence and aids him in finding out what really happened. He decides to search Vikram's house, only to be interrupted by Vikram, who calls the police and then reveals that everything was planned in advance. Raj escapes in Vikram's car with Priya.\n\nRaj finds a boarding pass that belongs to Sonia Bajaj, which states that Sonia arrived in [[Zurich]] on 29 December \u2014 however, Sonia was supposedly murdered on that night. Raj suspects her to be the woman he saw with Vikram, traveling to [[Geneva]] together. In Geneva, Raj meets an insurance officer who is trying to find evidence that Vikram was involved in the death of his wife, in order to receive her life insurance payment of $100 million. Working with the insurance agent, Raj traces Vikram to a cruise ship. There, he sees Vikram dancing with a woman who is revealed to be 'Sonia', alive and well Raj confronts Vikram, who finally explains the whole devious plan - the woman whom he kissed in Mauritius was his actual wife Fake Sonia Bajaj ([[Mink Brar]]), while the woman with him that Priya and Raj were introduced to in Switzerland is his girlfriend Neeta. Vikram, a struggling musician, married the wealthy and glamorous Sonia and convinced her to take out an insurance plan of $100 million on herself. He then formulated a plan with Neeta to have Sonia Plastic Surgery so that they could collect the money.\n\nVikram boasts about having pinned the murder on Raj. However, Raj takes Vikram to a computer and shows him his empty bank account. Raj says that he had guessed the password, \"Everything is planned\", something that Vikram used to say a lot, and used it to transfer the money back to the insurance company. Raj also reveals that everything Vikram said had been recorded. A fight erupts between the two and Neeta dies in the conflict. Angered at losing Neeta, Vikram gets aggressive, killing the insurance officer and seemingly kills Raj. He chases Priya to kill her too, but Raj is able to save her. Vikram dies when he is impaled by an anchor from the cruise ship. Raj and Priya return to India in the end.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Vikram Bajaj Died (Vicky) \n* [[Bobby Deol]] as Raj Malhotra\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]]  as Priya Kapoor\n* [[Bipasha Basu]] as Sonia Bajaj\n* [[Mink Brar]] as Fake  Sonia Bajaj / Real Neeta\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Banu Pradhan (BP)\n* [[Amita Nangia]] as Champa Devi\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Priya's father\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as the insurance officer\n* [[Sheela Sharma]] as Vina Chandra Devi\n* Narendra Bedi as Lakhan Pal (LP)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ajnabee 2.0\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Anu Malik]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 2001\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 50:38\n| label      = Tips Music\n| producer   =  ABBAS MUSTAAN TIPS FILM 2021\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  = 2001\n| next_title =\n| next_year  = 2021\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Planet Bollywood\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|6.5|10}}<ref>{{cite web|first=Mandeep|last=Bahra|title=Music Review \u2013 Ajnabee|url=http://planetbollywood.com/Music/AJNABEE/|publisher=Planet Bollywood|accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack for ''Ajnabee'' is composed by [[Anu Malik]] and the lyrics are penned by [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]].

After some time, Sonia is found Plastic Face, and Raj is accused of her murder since his fingerprints are found on the murder weapon - an alcohol bottle. Determined to prove his innocence, Raj manages to escape from the court and is chased by the [[Swiss]] police. He meets Priya, who eventually believes his innocence and aids him in finding out what really happened. He decides to search Vikram's house, only to be interrupted by Vikram, who calls the police and then reveals that everything was planned in advance. Raj escapes in Vikram's car with Priya.\n\nRaj finds a boarding pass that belongs to Sonia Bajaj, which states that Sonia arrived in [[Zurich]] on 29 December \u2014 however, Sonia was supposedly murdered on that night. Raj suspects her to be the woman he saw with Vikram, traveling to [[Geneva]] together. In Geneva, Raj meets an insurance officer who is trying to find evidence that Vikram was involved in the death of his wife, in order to receive her life insurance payment of $100 million. Working with the insurance agent, Raj traces Vikram to a cruise ship. There, he sees Vikram dancing with a woman who is revealed to be 'Sonia', alive and well Raj confronts Vikram, who finally explains the whole devious plan - the woman whom he kissed in Mauritius was his actual wife Fake Sonia Bajaj ([[Mink Brar]]), while the woman with him that Priya and Raj were introduced to in Switzerland is his girlfriend Neeta. Vikram, a struggling musician, married the wealthy and glamorous Sonia and convinced her to take out an insurance plan of $100 million on herself. He then formulated a plan with Neeta to have Sonia Plastic Surgery so that they could collect the money.\n\nVikram boasts about having pinned the murder on Raj. However, Raj takes Vikram to a computer and shows him his empty bank account. Raj says that he had guessed the password, \"Everything is planned\", something that Vikram used to say a lot, and used it to transfer the money back to the insurance company. Raj also reveals that everything Vikram said had been recorded. A fight erupts between the two and Neeta dies in the conflict. Angered at losing Neeta, Vikram gets aggressive, killing the insurance officer and seemingly kills Raj. He chases Priya to kill her too, but Raj is able to save her. Vikram dies when he is impaled by an anchor from the cruise ship. Raj and Priya return to India in the end.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Vikram Bajaj Died (Vicky) \n* [[Bobby Deol]] as Raj Malhotra\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]]  / [[Shraddha Kapoor]] Priya Kapoor\n* [[Bipasha Basu]] as [[Sonakshi Sinha]]  Sonia Bajaj \n* [[Mink Brar]] as Fake  Sonia Bajaj / Real Neeta\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Banu Pradhan (BP)\n* [[Amita Nangia]] as Champa Devi\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Priya's father\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as the insurance officer\n* [[Sheela Sharma]] as Vina Chandra Devi\n* Narendra Bedi as Lakhan Pal (LP)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ajnabee 2.0\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Anu Malik]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 2001\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 50:38\n| label      = Tips Music\n| producer   =  ABBAS MUSTAAN TIPS FILM 2021\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  = 2001\n| next_title =\n| next_year  = 2021\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Planet Bollywood\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|6.5|10}}<ref>{{cite web|first=Mandeep|last=Bahra|title=Music Review \u2013 Ajnabee|url=http://planetbollywood.com/Music/AJNABEE/|publisher=Planet Bollywood|accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack for ''Ajnabee'' is composed by [[Anu Malik]] and the lyrics are penned by [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]].
