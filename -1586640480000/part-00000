They play in the [[Northern Counties East League]] Division One, at level 10 of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1860, it is second only to local rivals [[Sheffield F.C.]] in the list of the oldest association football clubs in the world. Games between these two clubs are known as the [[Rules derby]].\n\nThey have played at their [[Sandygate Road]] home in the Sheffield suburb of [[Crosspool]] since formation, with the ground being officially recognised by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as \"The Oldest Football Ground in the World\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-23471740 World's oldest football teams play in derby] BBC</ref>\n\nIn 1867 the club made history by winning the world's first ever football tournament, the [[Youdan Cup]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Brendan|title=From Sheffield with Love|year=2007|publisher=SportBooks Limited|isbn=978-1-899807-56-7}}</ref> The club still possesses this historic trophy.\n\n==History==\nAlthough formed in 1860, the football club can trace its links even further back, to 1804, when the owner of the Plough Inn public house on Sandygate Road agreed to allow a new [[cricket]] club, Hallam CC, to start playing on an adjacent field he owned.\n\nThe club had in excess of 300 members by the 1850s,<ref name=\"History\">[https://www.hallamfc.co.uk/history.php History] Hallam FC</ref> and in 1860 it decided to form a football club to oppose [[Sheffield F.C.]], formed three years earlier. On Boxing Day 1860, the two clubs played each other on Sandygate Road for the first time. The match report for the game in the ''Sheffield Daily Telegraph''<ref>''Sheffield Daily Telegraph'', 28 December 1860</ref> states that the game was played between 16 of Sheffield and 16 of Hallam and Stumperlowe (Stumperlowe being a hamlet half a mile from Sandygate).<ref name=\"Countrymen\">{{cite book|last=Steele|first=John A|title=The Countrymen: History of Hallam Football Club|year=2010|publisher=Northern Map Distributors|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe Hallam Football Club's founder and captain, John Charles Shaw, soon became President of the [[Sheffield Football Association]] which organised matches according to the locally preferred rules for its growing number of member clubs. Shaw was directly instrumental, with Charles Alcock of the London-based [[Football Association]], in the formation of nationally accepted rules for playing the game. Shaw and Alcock were the respective captains in the first game between a Sheffield XI and a London XI, in 1871, in which the preferred rules were tried out.\n\nIn 1867, Hallam won the first ever football competition, the [[Youdan Cup]]. The trophy was subsequently misplaced by the club, and did not resurface again until 1997 when a Scottish antiques collector who had come into possession of the silver trophy sold it back to the club for \u00a32,000. In 2014 the trophy was featured on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', where it was valued at \u00a3100,000. Club chairman Chris Taylor subsequently said the club had no plans to sell the trophy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29598744 |title=World's oldest football trophy 'not for sale' |publisher=BBC News |date=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough professionalism began to creep into the game during the 1870s and -80s, Hallam chose to remain fully amateur. In the summer of 1886, for reasons unknown but likely because of financial constraints, the club was dissolved, but a year later the club was re-formed and re-registered with the Sheffield & Hallamshire FA.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/>\n\nHallam entered their first league competition in 1892 when joining the newly formed Hallamshire League, and they would also play in the Sheffield Minor Cup League, Sheffield Alliance and the [[Hatchard League]] as the 19th century came to a close.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/> They won the Hatchard League title for the first time in 1903, and a year later won the league again, though they lost the play-off final played between the top four teams, and so surrendered their title. They also reached the final of the [[Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup]] for the first time in 1904, but lost 1\u20136 to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] reserves at [[Bramall Lane]].<ref>[[Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup]] Wikipedia</ref>\n\nIn 1911 the club first competed in a [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (FA) cup competition, when they entered the [[FA Amateur Cup]]. Three years later the [[First World War]] began, but Hallam continued to play, dropping out of the Hatchard League to join the Sheffield Amateur and Minor Leagues, previously staples of the club's reserve team. Eventually, in 1917, Hallam decided they could no longer keep playing, and suspended playing operations, only re-joining the [[Sheffield Amateur League]] after hostilities had ended, in 1919.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/>\n\nIn 1925 Hallam pulled off one of their greatest ever results when they knocked out five-time Amateur Cup winners [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]] in front of over 2,000 people at Sandygate Road. Two years later the club entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time. After winning the [[Sheffield Amateur League]] for the second time in 1927, they were admitted back into the Sheffield Association League.\n\nAt the end of the 1932\u201333 season the landlord of the Plough Inn public house decided to lease the Sandygate Road ground to other teams (Crookes WMC and later [[Fulwood F.C.|Fulwood]]) as Hallam were not providing enough bar takings. Although the club retained its affiliation with the local FA, Hallam's eviction from their ground saw them refrain from playing any football for a period of 15 years.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/>\n\nHallam's return to football came about in 1947 when they finally arranged a return to Sandygate Road, playing in the [[Sheffield Amateur League]] and the re-formed Hatchard League (which they won) before finally re-joining the Sheffield Association League in 1949, winning the title for the first time.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/> A year later Hallam won the [[Sheffield Senior Cup]] for the first time when they beat [[Stocksbridge Works F.C.|Stocksbridge Works]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in front of 7,240 spectators, and in 1952 they entered the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]].\n\nThat same season an Amateur Cup tie with Dulwich Hamlet was switched to [[Hillsborough stadium]] because of increased ticket demands&nbsp;\u2013 the attendance of over 13,000 proving to be a club record. After winning promotion to the top flight of the Yorkshire League for a second time in 1960,<ref name=\"Hallam\">[http://fchd.info/HALLAM.HTM Hallam] Football Club History Database</ref> Hallam spent twenty years playing at the same level.\n\nThe 1982\u201383 season saw the demise of the old [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]], with Hallam entering the new [[Northern Counties East League]] (NCEL), which demanded more stringent ground grading rules. With only seven years of its ground lease remaining the club could not commit to expensive improvements. Protracted negotiations with the landlord eventually led to a 99 years extension being granted but a large premium was demanded within one year.<ref name=\"History\"/> A massive fund raising effort secured the new lease and continued for the provision of floodlights, first used in 1992, and a stand behind one goal to shelter 100 people.\n\nThe club has spent most of its time in the NCEL in the Premier Division (which currently sits at level 9 of the [[English football league system]]), and won the League Cup competition in 2004 when beating [[Mickleover Sports]] in the final,<ref>[http://www.ncefl.org.uk/league/honours/ Honours] Northern Counties East League</ref> but in 2011 they were relegated back to the First Division.\n\nIn 2012, Sandygate Road received a much needed facelift, paid for by a posthumous donation by a lifelong supporter who had left the club a substantial amount of money in his will.<ref>.

They play in the [[Northern Counties East League]] Division One, at level 10 of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1860, it is second only to local rivals [[Sheffield F.C.]] in the list of the oldest association football clubs in the world. Games between these two clubs are known as the [[Rules derby]].\n\nThey have played at their [[Sandygate Road]] home in the Sheffield suburb of [[Crosspool]] since formation, with the ground being officially recognised by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as \"The Oldest Football Ground in the World\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-23471740 World's oldest football teams play in derby] BBC</ref>\n\nIn 1867 the club made history by winning the world's first ever football tournament, the [[Youdan Cup]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Brendan|title=From Sheffield with Love|year=2007|publisher=SportBooks Limited|isbn=978-1-899807-56-7}}</ref> The club still possesses this historic trophy.\n\n==History==\nAlthough formed in 1860, the football club can trace its links even further back, to 1804, when the owner of the Plough Inn public house on Sandygate Road agreed to allow a new [[cricket]] club, Hallam CC, to start playing on an adjacent field he owned.\n\nThe club had in excess of 300 members by the 1850s,<ref name=\"History\">[https://www.hallamfc.co.uk/history.php History] Hallam FC</ref> and in 1860 it decided to form a football club to oppose [[Sheffield F.C.]], formed three years earlier. On Boxing Day 1860, the two clubs played each other on Sandygate Road for the first time. The match report for the game in the ''Sheffield Daily Telegraph''<ref>''Sheffield Daily Telegraph'', 28 December 1860</ref> states that the game was played between 16 of Sheffield and 16 of Hallam and Stumperlowe (Stumperlowe being a hamlet half a mile from Sandygate).<ref name=\"Countrymen\">{{cite book|last=Steele|first=John A|title=The Countrymen: History of Hallam Football Club|year=2010|publisher=Northern Map Distributors|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe Hallam Football Club's founder and captain, John Charles Shaw, soon became President of the [[Sheffield Football Association]] which organised matches according to the locally preferred rules for its growing number of member clubs. Shaw was directly instrumental, with Charles Alcock of the London-based [[Football Association]], in the formation of nationally accepted rules for playing the game. Shaw and Alcock were the respective captains in the first game between a Sheffield XI and a London XI, in 1871, in which the preferred rules were tried out.\n\nIn 1867, Hallam won the first ever football competition, the [[Youdan Cup]]. The trophy was subsequently misplaced by the club, and did not resurface again until 1997 when a Scottish antiques collector who had come into possession of the silver trophy sold it back to the club for \u00a32,000. In 2014 the trophy was featured on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', where it was valued at \u00a3100,000. Club chairman Chris Taylor subsequently said the club had no plans to sell the trophy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29598744 |title=World's oldest football trophy 'not for sale' |publisher=BBC News |date=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough professionalism began to creep into the game during the 1870s and -80s, Hallam chose to remain fully amateur. In the summer of 1886, for reasons unknown but likely because of financial constraints, the club was dissolved, but a year later the club was re-formed and re-registered with the Sheffield & Hallamshire FA.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/>\n\nHallam entered their first league competition in 1892 when joining the newly formed Hallamshire League, and they would also play in the Sheffield Minor Cup League, Sheffield Alliance and the [[Hatchard League]] as the 19th century came to a close.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/> They won the Hatchard League title for the first time in 1903, and a year later won the league again, though they lost the play-off final played between the top four teams, and so surrendered their title. They also reached the final of the [[Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup]] for the first time in 1904, but lost 1\u20136 to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] reserves at [[Bramall Lane]].<ref>[[Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup]] Wikipedia</ref>\n\nIn 1911 the club first competed in a [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (FA) cup competition, when they entered the [[FA Amateur Cup]]. Three years later the [[First World War]] began, but Hallam continued to play, dropping out of the Hatchard League to join the Sheffield Amateur and Minor Leagues, previously staples of the club's reserve team. Eventually, in 1917, Hallam decided they could no longer keep playing, and suspended playing operations, only re-joining the [[Sheffield Amateur League]] after hostilities had ended, in 1919.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/>\n\nIn 1925 Hallam pulled off one of their greatest ever results when they knocked out five-time Amateur Cup winners [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]] in front of over 2,000 people at Sandygate Road. Two years later the club entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time. After winning the [[Sheffield Amateur League]] for the second time in 1927, they were admitted back into the Sheffield Association League.\n\nAt the end of the 1932\u201333 season the landlord of the Plough Inn public house decided to lease the Sandygate Road ground to other teams (Crookes WMC and later [[Fulwood F.C.|Fulwood]]) as Hallam were not providing enough bar takings. Although the club retained its affiliation with the local FA, Hallam's eviction from their ground saw them refrain from playing any football for a period of 15 years.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/>\n\nHallam's return to football came about in 1947 when they finally arranged a return to Sandygate Road, playing in the [[Sheffield Amateur League]] and the re-formed Hatchard League (which they won) before finally re-joining the Sheffield Association League in 1949, winning the title for the first time.<ref name=\"Countrymen\"/> A year later Hallam won the [[Sheffield Senior Cup]] for the first time when they beat [[Stocksbridge Works F.C.|Stocksbridge Works]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in front of 7,240 spectators, and in 1952 they entered the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]].\n\nThat same season an Amateur Cup tie with Dulwich Hamlet was switched to [[Hillsborough stadium]] because of increased ticket demands&nbsp;\u2013 the attendance of over 13,000 proving to be a club record. After winning promotion to the top flight of the Yorkshire League for a second time in 1960,<ref name=\"Hallam\">[http://fchd.info/HALLAM.HTM Hallam] Football Club History Database</ref> Hallam spent twenty years playing at the same level.\n\nThe 1982\u201383 season saw the demise of the old [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]], with Hallam entering the new [[Northern Counties East League]] (NCEL), which demanded more stringent ground grading rules. With only seven years of its ground lease remaining the club could not commit to expensive improvements. Protracted negotiations with the landlord eventually led to a 99 years extension being granted but a large premium was demanded within one year.<ref name=\"History\"/> A massive fund raising effort secured the new lease and continued for the provision of floodlights, first used in 1992, and a stand behind one goal to shelter 100 people.\n\nThe club has spent most of its time in the NCEL in the Premier Division (which currently sits at level 9 of the [[English football league system]]), and won the League Cup competition in 2004 when beating [[Mickleover Sports]] in the final,<ref>[http://www.ncefl.org.uk/league/honours/ Honours] Northern Counties East League</ref> but in 2011 they were relegated back to the First Division.\n\nIn 2012, Sandygate Road received a much needed facelift, paid for by a posthumous donation by a lifelong supporter who had left the club a substantial amount of money in his will.<ref>.

in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is located approximately halfway between [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]] and [[Atlanta]] along [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|Interstate 85]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], it had a population of 3,474,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1382132\n| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): West Point city, Georgia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=May 18, 2017}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and in 2015 the estimated population was 3,728.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}</ref> Most of the city is in Troup County, which is part of the [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] [[Troup County, Georgia|Micropolitan Statistical Area]], and hence part of the [[Atlanta]]-[[Athens, Georgia|Athens-Clarke County]]-[[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]], GA [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} A sliver in the south is in Harris County, which is part of the [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]] [[Columbus metropolitan area, Georgia|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nThe city's present name comes from its being near the westernmost point of the [[Chattahoochee River]], where the river turns from its southwesterly flow from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to due south \u2013 for all practical purposes \u2013 and forms the boundary with [[Alabama]]. The large nearby reservoir, [[West Point Lake]], was created by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] by the building of the West Point Dam, for water storage and hydroelectric power generation. The reservoir stores water which can be released during dry seasons, in order to maintain the water level of the navigable [[inland waterway]] from [[Columbus, Georgia]], south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\nDuring the late spring of 2003, there was a flood caused by extremely heavy rainfall and thunderstorms upstream of the West Point Dam; the weather caused the water level in the reservoir to come close to overflowing the top of the dam. There were allegations of poor forecasting by the Corps of Engineers of the reservoir's water levels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The flood water would have overflowed the dam had a large amount of water not been released through the [[spillway]] of the dam. Whereas this prevented the catastrophic failure of the West Point Dam, the city endured a flood much more severe than any other in the time since the dam had been built.\n \nIn the mid-19th century, the Atlanta & LaGrange Railroad was established and soon renamed the [[Atlanta and West Point Railroad|Atlanta & West Point Railroad]], using the name of West Point; the city of [[East Point, Georgia|East Point, Fulton County, Georgia]], received its name for being at the northeastern end of this railroad line. The rail line linked [[metropolitan Atlanta]] with the lower reaches of the Chattahoochee River, with Columbus, and with [[Montgomery, Alabama]], via the [[Montgomery and West Point Railroad|Montgomery & West Point Railroad]].\n\nPassenger service between Atlanta and Montgomery continued, on the \"[[West Point Route]]\", until approximately the beginning of the [[Amtrak]] era, or more than 100 years (circa 1855&ndash;circa 1970). The Montgomery-to-West Point rail line was completed in 1851, three years before the West Point-to-Atlanta segment. Rail operations were seriously disrupted during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u201365), as Southern rail lines were subject to [[Union Army]] attacks.\n\nToward the end of the war, West Point was the scene of the [[Battle of West Point]] (April 16, 1865, seven days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox).\n\n==Geography==\nWest Point is located primarily in the southwest corner of Troup County, with a portion extending south into the northwest corner of Harris County. It is bordered to the northeast by the city of [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]], the Troup County seat. The city is bordered to the west by the [[Chattahoochee River]], across which are the cities of [[Lanett, Alabama|Lanett]] and [[Valley, Alabama]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|29.2|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|28.9|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.3|km2|order=flip|1}}, or 1.11%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n[[Interstate 85 in Georgia|Interstate 85]] runs northeast to southwest through the city, leading northeast {{convert|81|mi}} to [[Atlanta]] and southwest {{convert|81|mi}} to [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. Other highways that run through the city include [[U.S. Route 29 in Georgia|U.S. Route 29]], [[Georgia State Route 18]], and [[Georgia State Route 103]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 1405\n|1880= 1178\n|1890= 1254\n|1900= 1797\n|1910= 1906\n|1920= 2138\n|1930= 2145\n|1940= 3591\n|1950= 4076\n|1960= 4610\n|1970= 4232\n|1980= 4305\n|1990= 3571\n|2000= 3382\n|2010= 3474\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3743\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 3,382 people, 1,354 households, and 931 families residing in the city.

It continues to be headquartered in West Point.\n\nWest Point Iron Works was founded in West Point three years after the Civil War ended. The company started off as a supplier of individual components, such as pulleys and gears, to nearby textile mills. In the 1930s the company was renamed West Point Foundry and Machine Co. In the 2000s, having been negatively impacted by imports (cloth) the company turned to SEETAC to seek assistance to use the firm's engineering and production expertise to provide products to the U.S. military. The firm also changed its name to West Point Industries to emphasize its broader client base.

in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is located approximately halfway between [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]] and [[Atlanta]] along [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|Interstate 85]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], it had a population of 3,474,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1382132\n| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): West Point city, Georgia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=May 18, 2017}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and in 2015 the estimated population was 3,728.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}</ref> Most of the city is in Troup County, which is part of the [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] [[Troup County, Georgia|Micropolitan Statistical Area]], and hence part of the [[Atlanta]]-[[Athens, Georgia|Athens-Clarke County]]-[[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]], GA [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} A sliver in the south is in Harris County, which is part of the [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]] [[Columbus metropolitan area, Georgia|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nThe city's present name comes from its being near the westernmost point of the [[Chattahoochee River]], where the river turns from its southwesterly flow from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to due south \u2013 for all practical purposes \u2013 and forms the boundary with [[Alabama]]. The large nearby reservoir, [[West Point Lake]], was created by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] by the building of the West Point Dam, for water storage and hydroelectric power generation. The reservoir stores water which can be released during dry seasons, in order to maintain the water level of the navigable [[inland waterway]] from [[Columbus, Georgia]], south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\nDuring the late spring of 2003, there was a flood caused by extremely heavy rainfall and thunderstorms upstream of the West Point Dam; the weather caused the water level in the reservoir to come close to overflowing the top of the dam. There were allegations of poor forecasting by the Corps of Engineers of the reservoir's water levels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The flood water would have overflowed the dam had a large amount of water not been released though the [[spillway]] of the dam. Whereas this prevented the catastrophic failure of the West Point Dam, the city endured a flood much more severe than any other in the time since the dam had been built.\n \nIn the mid-19th century, the Atlanta & LaGrange Railroad was established and soon renamed the [[Atlanta and West Point Railroad|Atlanta & West Point Railroad]], using the name of West Point; the city of [[East Point, Georgia|East Point, Fulton County, Georgia]], received its name for being at the northeastern end of this railroad line. The rail line linked [[metropolitan Atlanta]] with the lower reaches of the Chattahoochee River, with Columbus, and with [[Montgomery, Alabama]], via the [[Montgomery and West Point Railroad|Montgomery & West Point Railroad]].\n\nPassenger service between Atlanta and Montgomery continued, on the \"[[West Point Route]]\", until approximately the beginning of the [[Amtrak]] era, or more than 100 years (circa 1855&ndash;circa 1970). The Montgomery-to-West Point rail line was completed in 1851, three years before the West Point-to-Atlanta segment. Rail operations were seriously disrupted during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u201365), as Southern rail lines were subject to [[Union Army]] attacks.\n\nToward the end of the war, West Point was the scene of the [[Battle of West Point]] (April 16, 1865, seven days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox).\n\n==Geography==\nWest Point is located primarily in the southwest corner of Troup County, with a portion extending south into the northwest corner of Harris County. It is bordered to the northeast by the city of [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]], the Troup County seat. The city is bordered to the west by the [[Chattahoochee River]], across which are the cities of [[Lanett, Alabama|Lanett]] and [[Valley, Alabama]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|29.2|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|28.9|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.3|km2|order=flip|1}}, or 1.11%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n[[Interstate 85 in Georgia|Interstate 85]] runs northeast to southwest through the city, leading northeast {{convert|81|mi}} to [[Atlanta]] and southwest {{convert|81|mi}} to [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. Other highways that run through the city include [[U.S. Route 29 in Georgia|U.S. Route 29]], [[Georgia State Route 18]], and [[Georgia State Route 103]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 1405\n|1880= 1178\n|1890= 1254\n|1900= 1797\n|1910= 1906\n|1920= 2138\n|1930= 2145\n|1940= 3591\n|1950= 4076\n|1960= 4610\n|1970= 4232\n|1980= 4305\n|1990= 3571\n|2000= 3382\n|2010= 3474\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3743\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 3,382 people, 1,354 households, and 931 families residing in the city.

It continues to be headquartered in West Point.\n\nWest Point Iron Works was founded in West Point three years after the Civil War ended. The company started off as a supplier of individual components, such as pulleys and gears, to nearby textile mills. In the 1930s the company was renamed West Point Foundry and Machine Co. In the 2000s, having been negatively impacted by imports (cloth) the company turned to SEETAC to seek assistance to use the firm's engineering and production expertise to provide products to the U.S. military.

In the later-released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]], a younger version of the character serves as one of the main [[protagonist]]s alongside [[Anakin Skywalker]] and is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]]. In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to [[Luke Skywalker]], to whom he introduces the ways of the [[Jedi]], until he becomes one with the Force after sacrificing himself to [[Darth Vader]] in their fight and later guides Luke alongside [[Yoda]] in the fight against the Empire by the Rebel Alliance while also being instrumental in Luke's completion of his Jedi training. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to a [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] named [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and later the mentor and friend to Luke's father Anakin, who falls to the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Vader. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nGuinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] (1977){{EpIV}} earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the only acting nomination for a ''Star Wars'' film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the usually criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Kenobi in an untitled web series on [[Disney+]] centered on the character that takes place some years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' and prior to ''A New Hope''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Skywalker saga===\n{{main|Skywalker saga}}\n\n====Original trilogy (1977\u20131983)====\n[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 02 (Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from Episode IV).jpg|thumb|Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from ''Episode IV'']]\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is first introduced in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{EpIV}} living as a [[hermit]] by the name of Ben Kenobi on the planet [[Tatooine]].{{efn|In an early draft of the film, his first meeting with Luke is lifted directly from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', acknowledging [[Gandalf]] as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|year=2015|publisher=Performing Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uG0uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|page=96}}</ref>}} The family of [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) purchases two droids, [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) and [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]]), the former of whom is able to speak English to communicate with Luke, while the latter can only communicate through beeps understood only by C-3PO. C-3PO explains to Luke that R2-D2 claims to have belonged to a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, although C-3PO does not remember this and does not know what R2-D2 is talking about. Luke, recognizing the surname, makes the connection to Ben Kenobi, and begins to wonder if the two are related, or the same person. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the lost [[R2-D2]], Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. At Obi-Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire's]] superweapon: the [[Death Star]]. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to the planet [[Alderaan]] in order to help the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\nObi-Wan reveals to Luke his true identity and explains that he is a [[Jedi]], a member of an ancient group of [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]] and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]) and uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) have been killed by [[Imperial stormtroopers]], he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi.\n\nAt the settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], Obi-Wan [[Jedi mind trick|uses the Force]] to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local [[cantina]] and meet smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) alongside the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \"a great disturbance in the Force\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that the planet [[Alderaan]] has been destroyed by the Empire.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' then encounters an Imperial [[TIE Fighter]]. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables tractor beam, but not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the ''Falcon''. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the [[Battle of Yavin|Rebel attack on the Death Star]], Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station.\n\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a [[Force ghost|spirit]] through the Force. On the ice planet [[Hoth]], he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]] ([[Frank Oz]]). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back.html |title=Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imdsb.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice.

When Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan storms in to duel Maul, who nearly kills him. However, Obi-Wan manages to turn the tables and defeat Maul, slicing him in half and sending him plunging down a vast reactor shaft. He promises to fulfill Qui-Gon's dying wish of training Anakin as a Jedi, with or without the Council's blessing.

Over the years, Anakin has grown powerful but somewhat arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is \"holding him back.\" After they save Padm\u00e9, now a senator, from an assassination attempt, Obi-Wan goes on a solo mission to trace the would-be assassins involved to the planet [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He learns of a [[Clone trooper|massive clone army]] that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Republic. The clones' template is bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]] ([[Temuera Morrison]]), and he and Obi-Wan battle once the latter deduces Fett must be behind the attempted assassination.

Anakin Skywalker, by now a Jedi Knight, remains Obi-Wan's partner, and the two have become war heroes and best friends. The film opens with the two on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped [[Palpatine|Supreme Chancellor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) from cyborg Separatist commander [[General Grievous]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) onboard his cruiser. Dooku duels the Jedi once again, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious; while Obi-Wan is out cold, Anakin defeats Dooku and reluctantly executes him on Palpatine's orders. Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] to track down Grievous.\n\nAfter finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine\u2014who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war\u2014issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the [[Jedi Temple]] has been killed. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin\u2014who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader\u2014who led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with battling Anakin. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin no longer exists, having been \u201cconsumed\u201d by Vader.\n\nObi-Wan visits Padm\u00e9 to question of Anakin's whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm\u00e9 sets out to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts his longtime apprentice, who accuses Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm\u00e9 into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin by severing his legs and left arm; as Anakin is immolated and mutilated by the bank of a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves Mustafar with C-3PO, R2-D2, and a fainted Padm\u00e9. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Anakin is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy.\n\nObi-Wan takes Padm\u00e9 to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to deliver Luke to Anakin\u2019s stepbrother [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Joel Edgerton]]) and his wife [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Bonnie Piesse]]) at the moisture farm on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned to teach him to become one with the Force after death.

The ''Jedi Apprentice'' books follow his adventures as Qui-Gon's Padawan. Notable events in the series include battling the Dark Jedi Xanatos and going on his first independent mission. The ''Jedi Quest'' books detail his adventures with Anakin in the years leading up to ''Attack of the Clones''.\n\nHis heroism just before and during the Clone Wars is portrayed in novels such as ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', ''[[The Approaching Storm]]'', and ''[[The Cestus Deception]]''.\n\nObi-Wan's life between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'' is portrayed mostly in [[Jude Watson]]'s ''[[The Last of the Jedi]]'' series. Set roughly a year after the fall of the Republic, the series follows Obi-Wan as he seeks out possible survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]], most notably Anakin's former rival, Ferus Olin. The books also portray Obi-Wan adjusting to life as a hermit on Tatooine and quietly watching over Luke. He also discovers that Vader is still alive after seeing him on the Holonet, the galaxy's official news source.\n\nObi-Wan appears in the final chapter of ''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'', set just after the events in ''Revenge of the Sith'', in which he learns that Vader survived their duel on Mustafar.\n\nObi-Wan appears in spirit form in many novels set after ''Return of the Jedi''. In ''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'', he appears to Luke to warn him about the threat presented by the Ssi-ruuk; in ''[[The Lost City of the Jedi]]'', he guides Luke to the titular city on [[Yavin IV]]; in ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'', meanwhile, he bids farewell to Luke, explaining that he must abandon his spiritual form to \"move on\" to a new, higher plane of [[consciousness]]. Before parting, Luke says that Obi-Wan was like a father to him, and Obi-Wan replies that he loved Luke like a son.\n\n====Video games====\nObi-Wan Kenobi appears in several video games. He is a playable character in all four ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]'' [[video game]]s, as well as ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Battlefront II]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron|Renegade Squadron]]''. He is also the lead character in ''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan]]''. The older version is only playable in ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' multiplayer mode and [[Death Star]] bonus mission ''[[Star Wars: Renegade Squadron]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' in multiplayer mode and the droid [[PROXY]] disguises as him. He also appears in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Jedi Alliance]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Lightsaber Duels]]'' as a playable character. He is also playable in the strategy game ''Star Wars: Empire at War''. He is a playable character in ''Disney Infinity 3.0''. Kenobi is also a playable character as part of the Clone Wars season for ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Alex |last=Kane|title=Obi-Wan Kenobi, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker Coming to \u2018Battlefront II\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/clone-wars-battlefront-ii-1202838716/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/star-wars/255307/star-wars-battlefront-2-new-clone-wars-content-and-heroes-coming-to-game |title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: New Clone Wars Content and Heroes Coming to Game |website=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Comic books====\nIssue #24 of Marvel's [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|1977 ''Star Wars'' comic]] depicts Obi-Wan during the time of the Republic.\n\nVarious [[Dark Horse Comics]] works utilize Kenobi, including [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)#Comics|several set during the Clone Wars]]. In ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' (1998\u20132006), Obi-Wan fights the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Among other notable storylines, he is kidnapped and tortured by Asajj Ventress before being rescued by Anakin (\"Hate & Fear\"), and apprehends corrupted Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]] (\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili\"). Throughout the series, he grows increasingly wary of Palpatine's designs on the Republic and his influence on Anakin.\n\nIn the non-canon story \"Old Wounds\", published in ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'' (2005) and set a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Obi-Wan confronts Darth Maul on Tatooine to protect Luke. The duel ends when Owen Lars shoots and kills Maul; he then warns Obi-Wan to stay away from his nephew. Through the Force, Obi-Wan reassures Luke that he will be there for him when needed.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe character is loosely inspired by General Makabe Rokur\u014dta, a character from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', played by [[Toshiro Mifune]] (whom series creator [[George Lucas]] also considered casting as Obi-Wan).<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Enk|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/seven-samurai-star-toshiro-mifune-face-darth-vader-202128282.html|title='Seven Samurai' star Toshiro Mifune: The would-be face of Darth Vader?|website=[[Yahoo.com]]|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the original film under the title ''Star Roars'' and included a character named 'Oldie Von Moldie', a grizzled 97-year-old whose lightsaber runs on an extension cord. The [[Shanghai]] [[nightclub]] shown in the beginning of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is called \"Club Obi Wan\" (Lucas wrote both the ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series). A real bar/club by this name existed in the [[Xihai District, Beijing|Xihai]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]] but closed in the summer of 2010. ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' episode \"Star Koopa\" (a spoof of ''Star Wars'') also had its own parody of Obi-Wan called 'Obi-Wan Toadi', and the live-action segment \"Zenned Out Mario\" featured a parody called \"Obi-Wan Cannoli\". The 1998 ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode \"Star Warners\" (which spoofed ''Star Wars'') featured [[Slappy Squirrel]] portraying a parody of Obi-Wan as 'Slappy Wanna Nappy'. In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]\", Obi-Wan Kenobi is parodied by the character [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]. In the short film ''[[Thumb Wars]]'', Obi-Wan is parodied as the character \"Oobedoob Benubi\". In the film, his full name is 'Oobedoob Scooby-Doobi Benubi, the silliest name in the galaxy.'

In the later-released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]], a younger version of the character serves as one of the main [[protagonist]]s alongside [[Anakin Skywalker]] and is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]]. In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to [[Luke Skywalker]], to whom he introduces the ways of the [[Jedi]], until he becomes one with the Force after sacrificing himself to [[Darth Vader]] in their fight and later guides him alongside [[Yoda]] in the fight against the Empire with the Rebel Alliance while also being instrumental in Luke's completion of his Jedi training. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to a [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] named [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and later the mentor and friend to Luke\u2019s father Anakin, who falls to the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Vader. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nGuinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] (1977){{EpIV}} earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the only acting nomination for a ''Star Wars'' film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the usually criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Kenobi in an untitled web series on [[Disney+]] centered on the character that takes place some years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' and prior to ''A New Hope''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Skywalker saga===\n{{main|Skywalker saga}}\n\n====Original trilogy (1977\u20131983)====\n[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 02 (Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from Episode IV).jpg|thumb|Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from ''Episode IV'']]\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is first introduced in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{EpIV}} living as a [[hermit]] by the name of Ben Kenobi on the planet [[Tatooine]].{{efn|In an early draft of the film, his first meeting with Luke is lifted directly from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', acknowledging [[Gandalf]] as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|year=2015|publisher=Performing Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uG0uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|page=96}}</ref>}} The family of [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) purchases two droids, [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) and [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]]), the former of whom is able to speak English to communicate with Luke, while the latter can only communicate through beeps understood only by C-3PO. C-3PO explains to Luke that R2-D2 claims to have belonged to a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, although C-3PO does not remember this and does not know what R2-D2 is talking about. Luke, recognizing the surname, makes the connection to Ben Kenobi, and begins to wonder if the two are related, or the same person. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the lost [[R2-D2]], Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. At Obi-Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire's]] superweapon: the [[Death Star]]. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to the planet [[Alderaan]] in order to help the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\nObi-Wan reveals to Luke his true identity and explains that he is a [[Jedi]], a member of an ancient group of [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]] and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]) and uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) have been killed by [[Imperial stormtroopers]], he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi.\n\nAt the settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], Obi-Wan [[Jedi mind trick|uses the Force]] to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local [[cantina]] and meet smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) alongside the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \"a great disturbance in the Force\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that the planet [[Alderaan]] has been destroyed by the Empire.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' then encounters an Imperial [[TIE Fighter]]. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables tractor beam, but not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the ''Falcon''. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the [[Battle of Yavin|Rebel attack on the Death Star]], Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station.\n\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a [[Force ghost|spirit]] through the Force. On the ice planet [[Hoth]], he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]] ([[Frank Oz]]). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back.html |title=Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imdsb.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice.

Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] to track down Grievous.\n\nAfter finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine\u2014who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war\u2014issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the [[Jedi Temple]] has been killed. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin\u2014who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader\u2014who led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with battling Anakin. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin no longer exists, having been \u201cconsumed\u201d by Vader.\n\nObi-Wan visits Padm\u00e9 to question of Anakin's whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm\u00e9 sets out to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts his longtime apprentice, who accuses Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm\u00e9 into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin by severing his legs and left arm; as Anakin is immolated and mutilated by the bank of a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves Mustafar with C-3PO, R2-D2, and a fainted Padm\u00e9. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Anakin is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy.\n\nObi-Wan takes Padm\u00e9 to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to deliver Luke to Anakin\u2019s stepbrother [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Joel Edgerton]]) and his wife [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Bonnie Piesse]]) at the moisture farm on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned to teach him to become one with the Force after death. On Tatooine, Obi-Wan hands Luke off to his step-family and goes into exile.\n\n====Sequel trilogy (2015\u20132019)====\nIn ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', set 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', the protagonist [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) hears Obi-Wan's voice when she touches the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke. Obi-Wan calls out to Rey, before saying the words of encouragement he gave to Luke during his training on the ''Millennium Falcon'': \"These are your first steps.\" [[James Arnold Taylor]] first recorded the lines for this scene, but his recordings were replaced with [[Ewan McGregor]]'s voice acting.<ref>{{cite tweet|first=James Arnold|last=Taylor|authorlink=James Arnold Taylor|user=JATactor|url=https://twitter.com/jatactor/status/678299784621350912|title=yes, it was me originally but they replaced my version with Ewan.

However, after restoration work in 1904\u20131905, overpainting was removed and a hand with [[sheet music]] was revealed indicating that the sitter may be a musician, a theory that is widely accepted today.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary accounts or even records of a [[commission (art)|commission]] of any kind exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff and rigid qualities of the figure. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have suggested that most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over who the subject is has caused many Italian musicians and politicians to be proposed as the young man. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/l/leonardo/03/1musicia.html |author1=Kr\u00e9n, Emil |author2=Marx, Daniel |title=Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor in the time of the painting's creation.<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/> The portrait has a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/> It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> \n\n===The Musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score.]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson237\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 237</ref> He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint|underpainted]] brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].<ref name=\"Kemp\">Kemp 2019, pp. 92</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart73\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 73</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/> The mouth hints at the start of a smile or perhaps the man about to sing or having just sung.<ref name=\"Pedretti\">Pedretti 1989, pp. 68</ref> A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. Both eyes are dilated but the left is to a far greater extent, something that is not humanly possible. Some propose this is simply for dramatic effect so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/>\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/> this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Pedretti\" /> The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"Oxford Art\"/> The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\">Z\u00f6llner 2015, pp. 45</ref> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.<ref name=\"Fagnart77\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commision a portrait himself.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n*{{cite magazine |last=Bambach |first=Carmen C. |date=2012 |title=\"Seeking the Universal Painter\" (review of exhibition, Leonardo, Painter at the Court of Milan, National Gallery, London) |url=https://www.academia.edu/4057518/Bambach_Seeking_the_Universal_Painter_review_of_exhibition_Leonardo_Painter_at_the_Court_of_Milan_National_Gallery_London_._Apollo_vol._175_no._595_Feb._2012_pp._82-85 |magazine= Apollo |location=London |publisher=Apollo |volume=175 |issue=595 |pages=82-83}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=David Alan |date=1983 |title=Leonardo and the Idealized Portrait in Milan |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43105426?seq=1 |journal=Arte Lombarda |volume=64 |pages= 105}}\n\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |author2=Martin Kemp |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=Penguin |year=1989 |ref=Clark |isbn=978-0140169829}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor2=Paul Kolb |title=Gaspar van Weerbeke.

Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured at least a partial attribution to Leonardo. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff and rigid qualities of the figure of the body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have suggested that most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over the subject has caused the proposal of many italian musicians and politicians to be the young man's identity. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/l/leonardo/03/1musicia.html |author1=Kr\u00e9n, Emil |author2=Marx, Daniel |title=Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor in the time of the painting's creation.

Both eyes are dilated but the left is to a far greater extent, something that is not humanly possible. Some propose this is simply for dramatic effect so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\nThe folded piece of paper is held in an odd and stiff way and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].

Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\"/> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano|Francesco Napoletano's]] drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.<ref name=\"National Gallery\">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Leonardo Da Vinci Painter at the Court of Milan |url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/media/15705/exhibition-guide_leonardo-da-vinci.pdf |location=London |publisher=The National Gallery |page=4 |date=n.d.}}</ref> However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.<ref name=\"Pooler32\"/>\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], priest, music theorist, court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and after January 1848, ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/> Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.<ref name=\"Pooler31\">Pooler 2014, pp. 31</ref> Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.<ref name=\"Gaffurius Grove\"/><ref>Pooler 2014, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C.

She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}} This theory has since been strongly discredited due to the notation in the painting being largely illegible and the fact that many composers of the time were writing the same forms in the same manner that was suggested to indicate specifically Josquin.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues\nas that of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making it unlikely to be him, a young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]], in the ''Portrait of a Musician''.<ref name=\"Josquin\"/>\n\n===Gaspar Van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested most recently in 2019 that the sitter's identity is, [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.<ref name=\"Fagnart76\"/> This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.<ref name= Fagnart76/>\n\n===Other Candidates===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freeart.com/artwork/art-print/leonardo-da-vinci-portrait-of-unknown_fan22837019.html |title=Leonardo da Vinci, portrait of unknown musician, perhaps Franchino Gaffurio or Galeazzo di Sanseverino.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.<ref name=\"Fagnart77\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commision a portrait himself.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n*{{cite magazine |last=Bambach |first=Carmen C. |date=2012 |title=\"Seeking the Universal Painter\" (review of exhibition, Leonardo, Painter at the Court of Milan, National Gallery, London) |url=https://www.academia.edu/4057518/Bambach_Seeking_the_Universal_Painter_review_of_exhibition_Leonardo_Painter_at_the_Court_of_Milan_National_Gallery_London_._Apollo_vol._175_no._595_Feb._2012_pp._82-85 |magazine= Apollo |location=London |publisher=Apollo |volume=175 |issue=595 |pages=82-83}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=David Alan |date=1983 |title=Leonardo and the Idealized Portrait in Milan |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43105426?seq=1 |journal=Arte Lombarda |volume=64 |pages= 105}}\n\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |author2=Martin Kemp |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=Penguin |year=1989 |ref=Clark |isbn=978-0140169829}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor2=Paul Kolb |title=Gaspar van Weerbeke.

(Cheetahs in the broadest sense could be added to this list, although the [[American cheetah|New]] and [[Cheetah|Old World]] forms are in different genera.)

In the cases of predators, the Old World representatives in at least some locations would thus have suffered less from extinctions of their prey species.

The song was written by Lavigne and [[Evan Taubenfeld]], while it was produced by [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald]]. The [[pop rock]] ballad talks about her feelings about a boyfriend, who makes her \"hot\". The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its \"old-style\" vibe and its anthemic nature. A version of the chorus in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] was released in [[China]] and a version of the chorus in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was released in [[Japan]].\n\nCommercially, the song was more successful in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and a few European countries, while it was a commercial disappointment in the [[United States]]. Lavigne performed the song at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2007|2007 MTV Europe Music Awards]], [[American Music Awards]], on ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' and many more. The music video directed by [[Matthew Rolston]] shows Lavigne in a more \"sexy\" way, with a \"1920s [[burlesque]]\" theme.\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter the success of her debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' (2002), Lavigne released her second album, ''[[Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)|Under My Skin]]'' (2004), which debuted at number one in more than ten countries, went platinum within one month, and further established Lavigne as a pop icon. Later, a song that was co-written by Lavigne and ultimately cut from the final track list -- \"[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]\"\u2014was later given to [[Kelly Clarkson]], who used it as the title track and lead-off single for her Grammy-winning [[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|second album]].<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite news|title=Avril Lavigne &#124; Biography &#124; Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/avril-lavigne-mn0000762885/biography|accessdate=February 17, 2014|newspaper=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In July 2006, Lavigne married [[Sum 41]]'s [[Deryck Whibley]] and spent most of the year working on her third album, enlisting [[blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]] to play drums, and cherry-picking a variety of producers (including her husband) to helm the recording sessions.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\"/> Lavigne described the album as \"really fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful way.\"<ref name=mtvnews1>{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Avril Lavigne, Deryck Whibley Dish Details On 'Fun, Young, Bratty' LP|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1548280/avril-lavigne-dishes-on-fun-young-bratty-new-lp.jhtml|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=16 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nLavigne worked with [[Evan Taubenfeld]] in four songs for the album, including \"Hot\".

The video begins with Lavigne, semi-disguised in a wig, making a grand entrance into a club in a black dress, with photographers and fans alike surrounding her. During the first verse she is seen in a dark, seductive outfit with very heavy makeup. In the chorus Lavigne is seen in a shiny, green corset preparing for what seems to be a rocker show. As such, she releases her emotions only when she's dressed the most revealingly and strongly. For the second chorus Lavigne makes her way on stage and continues to sing. During the song's bridge, in which Lavigne candidly reveals her raw feelings \u2014 about his love and kiss \u2014 Lavigne is dressed in a normal, plain outfit.\n\n== Live performances and promotion  ==\nLavigne performed the track in numerous places. The singer went to the [[2007 MTV Europe Music Awards]] to perform the track, and additionally won two awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne - Hot (Live in Munich - 2007 EMA's)|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/avril-lavigne/videos/hot-live-in-munich-2007-emas|work=[[MTV UK]]|accessdate=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223147/http://www.mtv.co.uk/avril-lavigne/videos/hot-live-in-munich-2007-emas|archive-date=21 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She also performed the track at the [[World Music Awards]] of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne -

The song was written by Lavigne and [[Evan Taubenfeld]], while it was produced by [[Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald]]. The [[pop rock]] ballad talks about her feelings about a boyfriend, who makes her \"hot\". The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its \"old-style\" vibe and its anthemic nature. A version of the chorus in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] was released in [[China]] and a version of the chorus in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was released in [[Japan]].\n\nCommercially, the song was more successful in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and a few European countries, while it was a commercial disappointment in the [[United States]]. Lavigne performed the song at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2007|2007 MTV Europe Music Awards]], [[American Music Awards]], on ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' and many more. The music video directed by [[Matthew Rolston]] shows Lavigne in a more \"sexy\" way, with a \"1920s [[burlesque]]\" theme.\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter the success of her debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' (2002), Lavigne released her second album, ''[[Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)|Under My Skin]]'' (2004), which debuted at number one in more than ten countries, went platinum within one month, and further established Lavigne as a pop icon. Later, a song that was co-written by Lavigne and ultimately cut from the final track list -- \"[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]\"\u2014was later given to [[Kelly Clarkson]], who used it as the title track and lead-off single for her Grammy-winning [[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|second album]].<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite news|title=Avril Lavigne &#124; Biography &#124; Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/avril-lavigne-mn0000762885/biography|accessdate=February 17, 2014|newspaper=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In July 2006, Lavigne married [[Sum 41]]'s [[Deryck Whibley]] and spent most of the year working on her third album, enlisting [[blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]] to play drums, and cherry-picking a variety of producers (including her husband) to helm the recording sessions.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\"/> Lavigne described the album as \"really fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful way.\"<ref name=mtvnews1>{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Avril Lavigne, Deryck Whibley Dish Details On 'Fun, Young, Bratty' LP|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1548280/avril-lavigne-dishes-on-fun-young-bratty-new-lp.jhtml|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=16 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nLavigne worked with [[Evan Taubenfeld]] in four songs for the album, including \"Hot\".

The video begins with Lavigne, semi-disguised in a wig, making a grand entrance into a club in a black dress, with photographers and fans alike surrounding her. During the first verse she is seen in a dark, seductive outfit with very heavy makeup. In the chorus Lavigne is seen in a shiny, green corset preparing for what seems to be a rocker show. As such, she releases her emotions only when she's dressed the most revealingly and strongly. For the second chorus Lavigne makes her way on stage and continues to sing. During the song's bridge, in which Lavigne candidly reveals her raw feelings \u2014 about his love and kiss \u2014 Lavigne is dressed in a normal, plain outfit.\n\n== Live performances and promotion  ==\nLavigne performed the track in numerous places. The singer went to the [[2007 MTV Europe Music Awards]] to perform the track, and additionally won two awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne - Hot (Live in Munich - 2007 EMA's)|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/avril-lavigne/videos/hot-live-in-munich-2007-emas|work=[[MTV UK]]|accessdate=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223147/http://www.mtv.co.uk/avril-lavigne/videos/hot-live-in-munich-2007-emas|archive-date=21 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She also performed the track at the [[World Music Awards]] of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne -

In its short length through New Hampshire, Interstate 95 traverses six municipalities: Seabrook, Hampton Falls, Hampton, North Hampton, Greenland, and Portsmouth.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2017-07-27 14 44 01 View south along Interstate 95 (Blue Star Turnpike-New Hampshire Turnpike) entering Portsmouth, Rockingham County, New Hampshire from Kittery, York County, Maine.jpg|thumb|right|View south along I-95 just after crossing the [[Piscataqua River Bridge]] from Maine]]\nI-95 crosses from Massachusetts into New Hampshire in the town of [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]].\nThere is a [[welcome center]] just north of the Massachusetts state line. The [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]] is accessible via exit&nbsp;1. The highway then continues through the coast towns of [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire|Hampton Falls]] and [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]], with state-run [[liquor store]]s just prior to exit&nbsp;2. I-95 interchanges with [[New Hampshire Route 101]] (NH&nbsp;101) in Hampton, then comes to a toll plaza soon after. That interchange also contains a ramp toll used by all traffic passing between the turnpike and NH&nbsp;101. Traffic using the turnpike that does not pass by or use exit&nbsp;2 does not pay a toll.\n\nI-95 then continues through the towns of [[North Hampton, New Hampshire|North Hampton]] and [[Greenland, New Hampshire|Greenland]] before entering the city of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. Near the north end, a connection to the [[Portsmouth Traffic Circle|Portsmouth Circle]] provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 Bypass (Portsmouth, New Hampshire)|U.S. Route 1 Bypass]] (US&nbsp;1 Byp.) and the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] ([[U.S. Route 4|US&nbsp;4]]/[[New Hampshire Route 16|NH&nbsp;16]]). I-95 crosses into Maine less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the Portsmouth Circle.\n\n==History==\nThe turnpike opened in 1950 as a four-lane highway parallel to [[U.S. Route 1 in New Hampshire|US&nbsp;1]] and was widened to eight lanes in 1976. The blue turnpike shield for the New Hampshire Turnpike is no longer in use, but was similar to the present-day signs for the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] and [[Everett Turnpike]].<ref>Michael Summa, [http://shields.aaroads.com/show.php?image=NH19610951t400950.jpg 1976 sign photo]</ref>\n\nFrom its designation in 1957 until 1972, I-95 in Portsmouth did not connect to I-95 in Kittery, Maine. Instead, the expressway ended at the Portsmouth Circle. From there, motorists followed US 1 Bypass via the [[Sarah Mildred Long Bridge]] to a junction near the Kittery Circle with US&nbsp;1. This bridge connected the New Hampshire and Maine Turnpikes. It was a [[movable bridge|drawbridge]] over the [[Piscataqua River|Piscataqua]] waterway, which created problems on busy days with frequent ship traffic. Not only was this an obstacle to traffic, but the  bridge was a narrow three-lane undivided roadway where the center lane could either be used in the direction of the greatest traffic flow or left closed for greater safety. Lane identification was accomplished via repeated banks of three traffic lights, one over each lane, and was the reason for the third (center) traffic light on the bridge. This bridge has since been replaced by another drawbridge with the same name.\n\nFurthermore, US 1 Bypass is not a [[controlled-access highway]], but an all-access divided highway (similar to US&nbsp;1 between [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] and [[Boston]] in Massachusetts). As far as most motorists were concerned, I-95 ended at the Portsmouth Circle and restarted in Kittery. The [[Piscataqua River Bridge]], which is not a drawbridge unlike the Long Bridge, was completed in the 1970s to correct this problem.

The final piece in Portsmouth splits from the turnpike south of the circle, running {{convert|2.42<!--3-->|mi|km}}<ref name=\"GRANIT\"/> to the [[Piscataqua River Bridge]], a steel [[arch bridge]], towards [[Maine]] and the [[Maine Turnpike]].  In its short length through New Hampshire, Interstate 95 traverses six municipalities - Seabrook, Hampton Falls, Hampton, North Hampton, Greenland, and Portsmouth.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2017-07-27 14 44 01 View south along Interstate 95 (Blue Star Turnpike-New Hampshire Turnpike) entering Portsmouth, Rockingham County, New Hampshire from Kittery, York County, Maine.jpg|thumb|right|View south along I-95 just after crossing the [[Piscataqua River Bridge]] from Maine]]\nI-95 crosses from Massachusetts into New Hampshire in the town of [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]].\nThere is a [[welcome center]] just north of the Massachusetts state line. The [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]] is accessible via exit&nbsp;1. The highway then continues through the coast towns of [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire|Hampton Falls]] and [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]], with state-run [[liquor store]]s just prior to exit&nbsp;2. I-95 interchanges with [[New Hampshire Route 101]] (NH&nbsp;101) in Hampton, then comes to a toll plaza soon after. That interchange also contains a ramp toll used by all traffic passing between the turnpike and NH&nbsp;101. Traffic using the turnpike that does not pass by or use exit&nbsp;2 does not pay a toll.\n\nI-95 then continues through the towns of [[North Hampton, New Hampshire|North Hampton]] and [[Greenland, New Hampshire|Greenland]] before entering the city of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. Near the north end, a connection to the [[Portsmouth Traffic Circle|Portsmouth Circle]] provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 Bypass (Portsmouth, New Hampshire)|U.S. Route 1 Bypass]] (US&nbsp;1 Byp.) and the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] ([[U.S. Route 4|US&nbsp;4]]/[[New Hampshire Route 16|NH&nbsp;16]]). I-95 crosses into Maine less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the Portsmouth Circle.\n\n==History==\nThe turnpike opened in 1950 as a four-lane highway parallel to [[U.S. Route 1 in New Hampshire|US&nbsp;1]] and was widened to eight lanes in 1976. The blue turnpike shield for the New Hampshire Turnpike is no longer in use, but was similar to the present-day signs for the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] and [[Everett Turnpike]].<ref>Michael Summa, [http://shields.aaroads.com/show.php?image=NH19610951t400950.jpg 1976 sign photo]</ref>\n\nFrom its designation in 1957 until 1972, I-95 in Portsmouth did not connect to I-95 in Kittery, Maine. Instead, the expressway ended at the Portsmouth Circle. From there, motorists followed US 1 Bypass via the [[Sarah Mildred Long Bridge]] to a junction near the Kittery Circle with US&nbsp;1. This bridge connected the New Hampshire and Maine Turnpikes. It was a [[movable bridge|drawbridge]] over the [[Piscataqua River|Piscataqua]] waterway, which created problems on busy days with frequent ship traffic. Not only was this an obstacle to traffic, but the  bridge was a narrow three-lane undivided roadway where the center lane could either be used in the direction of the greatest traffic flow or left closed for greater safety. Lane identification was accomplished via repeated banks of three traffic lights, one over each lane, and was the reason for the third (center) traffic light on the bridge. This bridge has since been replaced by another drawbridge with the same name.\n\nFurthermore, US 1 Bypass is not a [[controlled-access highway]], but an all-access divided highway (similar to US&nbsp;1 between [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] and [[Boston]] in Massachusetts). As far as most motorists were concerned, I-95 ended at the Portsmouth Circle and restarted in Kittery. The [[Piscataqua River Bridge]], which is not a drawbridge unlike the Long Bridge, was completed in the 1970s to correct this problem. Three construction workers fell to their deaths in the construction of the bridge.{{clear}}\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers are sequential.\n{{Jcttop|state=NH|exit|county=Rockingham|length_ref=<ref name=\"NHDOT Roads\">{{cite web|url=http://www.granit.unh.edu/data/search?dset=roads_dot|title=NH Public Roads|author=Bureau of Planning & Community Assistance|date=February 20, 2015|website=|publisher=[[New Hampshire Department of Transportation]]|place=Concord, New Hampshire|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NH Town Maps\">{{cite web|url=ftp://dot%2Ecity:streetmap@nhftp.admin.state.nh.us/2015_FULL_SIZE_PDFS/|title=Nodal Reference 2015, State of New Hampshire|author=Bureau of Planning & Community Assistance|date=April 3, 2015|website=|publisher=[[New Hampshire Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[ftp://dot%2Ecity:streetmap@nhftp.admin.state.nh.us/2015_FULL_SIZE_PDFS/SEABROOK_Wallmap.pdf Town of Seabrook, Rockingham County]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[ftp://dot%2Ecity:streetmap@nhftp.admin.state.nh.us/2015_FULL_SIZE_PDFS/HAMPTON_Wallmap.pdf Town of Hampton, Rockingham County]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[ftp://dot%2Ecity:streetmap@nhftp.admin.state.nh.us/2015_FULL_SIZE_PDFS/PORTSMOUTH_Wallmap.pdf City of Portsmouth, Rockingham County]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref>|location_ref=<ref name=\"NHDOT Roads\" /><ref name=\"NH Town Maps\" />}}\n{{Jctint|exit\n|location_special=[[New Hampshire]]\u2013[[Massachusetts]] line\n|lspan=2\n|exit=\u2014\n|mile=0.000\n|mspan=2\n|road={{Jct|state=MA|I|95|dir1=south}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[Massachusetts]]\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|mile=none\n|exit=60\n|road={{jct|state=MA|Route|286|location1=Beaches|location2=[[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury, MA]]|location3=Massachusetts Visitor Center}}\n|notes=Signed based on Massachusetts numbering; southbound exit originates in New Hampshire; future exit 90\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|location=Seabrook\n|mile=0.662\n|exit=1\n|road={{jct|state=NH|NH|107|city1=Seabrook|city2=Kingston}}\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|location=Hampton\n|lspan=2\n|type=toll\n|mile=5.465\n|exit=2\n|road={{jct|state=NH|NH|101|city1=Exeter|city2=Hampton|city3=Hampton Beach|city4=Manchester}}\n|notes=Hampton Side Toll Plaza\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|type=toll\n|mile=5.777\n|place=Hampton Main Toll Plaza\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|location=Portsmouth\n|lspan=7\n|mile=12.451\n|exit=3\n|road={{jct|state=NH|NH|33|city1=Greenland|city2=Portsmouth}}\n|notes=Signed as exit 3B southbound\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=13.225\n|exit=3A\n|road={{jct|extra=bus}}{{jct|extra=airport}}<!--These are signed at this exit--> [[Pease International Tradeport]], Park & Ride, Bus Terminal\n|notes=Southbound exit only\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=13.329\n|exit=4\n|road={{Jct|state=NH|Turnpike|Spaulding|US|4|NH|16|location1=[[Lakes Region (New Hampshire)|New Hampshire Lakes]]|location2=[[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]]|city3=Newington|city4=Dover}}\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|mile=13.836\n|exit=5\n|espan=2\n|road={{jct|state=NH|US-Byp|1|dab1=Portsmouth|name1=[[Portsmouth Traffic Circle|Portsmouth Circle]]}}\n|notes=Northbound signage\n}}\n{{NHint\n|mile=14.462\n|road={{Jct|state=NH|Turnpike|Spaulding|US|4|NH|16|city1=Newington|city2=Dover|city3=Durham|city4=Concord}}\n|notes=Southbound signage\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=14.565\n|exit=6\n|road=Woodbury Avenue&nbsp;\u2013 [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]\n|notes=Northbound exit only\n}}\n{{NHint|exit\n|mile=15.421\n|exit=7\n|road=Market Street / Woodbury Avenue&nbsp;\u2013 Downtown Portsmouth\n|notes=Woodbury Avenue not signed northbound\n}}\n{{Jctint|exit\n|location_special=[[Piscataqua River]]\n|exit=&ndash;\n|mile=16.193\n|road={{Jct|state=ME|I|95|dir1=north|name1=[[Piscataqua River Bridge]]|location1=All Maine Points}}\n|notes=Bridge; continuation into [[Maine]]\n}}\n{{jctbtm|exit|keys=incomplete,toll}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=title,inline}}\n* [http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/nh-turnpike Steve Anderson's BostonRoads.com: New Hampshire Turnpike (I-95)]\n\n{{state detail page browse|type=I|route=95|state=New Hampshire|stateafter=Maine|statebefore=Massachusetts}}\n[[Category:Greater Boston]]\n[[Category:Interstate 95|New Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Interstate Highways in New Hampshire|95]]\n[[Category:Toll roads in New Hampshire|095]]\n[[Category:Tolled sections of Interstate Highways|95]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Rockingham County, New Hampshire]]\n", "name_user": "Dmoore5556", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_95_in_New_Hampshire"}

{"title_page": "Black and White (novel)", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{long plot|date=September 2009}}\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2009}}\n}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Black and White''''' is a 2009 book written by [[Jackie Kessler]] and [[Caitlin Kittredge]] and published by [[Spectra Trade Paperbacks]].  The book is a [[superhero fiction|superhero novel]], similar to ''[[Soon I Will Be Invincible]]''.  It is the first book in the Icarus Project series. The second book, ''Shades of Gray'', was released in June 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo super powered women who were once friends end up on opposite sides of the law.  The two battle each other while trying to get to the truth and help make the world better.\n\nFrom the back of the book:  They were best friends at an elite academy for superheroes in training, but now Callie Bradford, code name Iridium, and Joannie Greene, code name Jet, are mortal enemies.  Jet is a by-the-book hero using her Shadow power to protect the citizens of New Chicago.  Iridium, with her mastery of light, runs the city's underworld.  For the Past Five Years the two have played an elaborate, and frustrating, game of Cat and Mouse.\n\nBut now playtime's over.  Separately Jet and Iridium uncover clues that point to a looming evil, one that is entwined within the Academy.  As Jet works with Bruce Hunter-a normal man with an extraordinary ability to make her weak in the knees-she becomes convinced that Iridium is involved in a scheme that will level the power structure of America itself.  And Iridium, teaming with the mysterious vigilante called Taser, uncovers an insidious plot that's been a decade in the making...a plot in which Jet is key.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe main story takes place in 2112 with five sections covering earlier events, starting ten years ago, and moving up to as five, with each year covering one of the school years at the academy.  Iridium and Jet are two new students starting their first year at the academy, both having events in their past and being assigned to roommates together.  The two eventually become friends, making enemies with Hornblower and Dawnlighter, and friends with Frostbite, Samson, and some of the other students.  Jet especially develops more of a close relationship with one of their teachers, Night, and becomes enemies with another, Lancer.  Later on the two are assigned as partners to each other to work together.\n\nWhen Jet's boyfriend Samson is killed by The Everyman Society on what was supposed to be a safe training exercise, the two start to drift apart as Jet gains early sponsorship from New Chicago for her funeral speech and immerses herself in her school work.  The two finally start to patch things up when Jet is sent to talk to Iridium who is upset because Frostbite has been sent to therapy for being in a homosexual relationship.\n\nDuring their final exam, where the teams have to collect gang flags from certain points through a town, Iridium falls from the vehicle and Jet is ordered back to fill the report in person.  As Iridium starts to walk toward a place she can get back to the academy from, she comes across a rapist attacking a prostitute who is off duty and refusing.  Iridium interrupts, letting the prostitute escape, and is attacked by the rapist, whom she kills, then turns the body over to the police.\n\nAfter Iridium's actions, it is decided that the young woman will be sent to therapy.  Jet, hearing this, fears for what it will do to her friend and does not think she will survive it.  She stops the people and makes a deal, having Iridium sent to Blackbird penetentary instead.  Just before the transfer, Jet sneaks in to talk to Iridium, who attacks her friend, feeling Jet betrayed the friendship, and escapes.  Iridium is labeled as a Rabid as she disappears, working toward her own goals in a section of New Chicago called Wrecked City.  Jet graduates, becoming the official superhero of New Chicago.\n\nFive years later, Iridium is spotted after robbing a bank, and Jet goes after her.  The two fight, ending in Iridium escaping with the money.  Jet ends up fighting a street gang when her new runner, Bruce Hunter, arrives.  Jet finds herself attracted to him and scolds herself some for thinking like that.  After an embarrassing appearance on the Jack Goldwater show, Night contacts Jet and asks her to look for Lynda Kidder, as a favor, implies that Corp-Co may not want the reporter found, which Jet has a hard time believing.\n\nAfter dealing with a local gangster who is not playing by her rules, Iridium meets with the leader of a gang called the Undergoths and learns of a vigilante working in her area who she confronts.  After fighting, she ends up concluding to partner with him as he seems to be of use in her plan to take down the Ops computer system.\n\nAs Jet is led down into the underground to find Lynda Kidder, Iridium and the vigilante, Taser, enter the underground to find access to the building where the blueprints of The Academy would be kept.  The pair come across Jet fighting Lynda who had been turned into a heavily muscled monster with a simple mind.  After defeating the monstrous Lynda, Jet attacks Iridium, believing that the former friend was somehow involved in what had happened to the reporter.  Iridium tries to talk sense into Jet, who won't listen, then ends up knocking the hero out and getting away.\n\nJet is shortly found by Bruce and taken to a hospital.  Her injuries are healed rapidly by a faith healer, but she is forced to spend two weeks having bed rest.  A prospect she does not fully enjoy.  Two days before she would be cleared, Jet is caught by Bruce at the window after stopping a purse snatching, and the two end up sleeping together.  Jet tries to tell Night the truth about Iridium not being involved in what happened to Lynda, but the former mentor will not listen, and mentions that Corp-Co has a deal with the Everyman Society.  Jet ends up realizing that somehow, Corp-Co has managed to brainwash her some without her knowing.\n\nAfter warning a friend of hers, Iridium, along with Taser, shuts down the back up power, then head to the headquarters for the superheroes.  The two shut off the power, then head up to the Academy, working through until they reach Ops.  They look at the computer for a moment, noticing a strange signal that's always broadcasting, they shut down Ops and destroy the computer.

The two battle each other while trying to get to the truth and help make the world better.\n\nFrom the back of the book:  They were best friends at an elite academy for superheroes in training, but now Callie Bradford, code name Iridium, and Joannie Greene, code name Jet, are mortal enemies.  Jet is a by-the-book hero using her Shadow power to protect the citizens of New Chicago.  Iridium, with her mastery of light, runs the city's underworld.  For the Past Five Years the two have played an elaborate, and frustrating, game of Cat and Mouse.\n\nBut now playtime's over.  Separately Jet and Iridium uncover clues that point to a looming evil, one that is entwined within the Academy.  As Jet works with Bruce Hunter-a normal man with an extraordinary ability to make her weak in the knees-she becomes convinced that Iridium is involved in a scheme that will level the power structure of America itself.  And Iridium, teaming with the mysterious vigilante called Taser, uncovers an insidious plot that's been a decade in the making...a plot in which Jet is key.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe main story takes place in 2112 with five sections covering earlier events, starting ten years ago, and moving up to as five, with each year covering one of the school years at the academy.  Iridium and Jet are two new students starting their first year at the academy, both having events in their past and being assigned to roommates together.  The two eventually become friends, making enemies with Hornblower and Dawnlighter, and friends with Frostbite, Samson, and some of the other students.  Jet especially develops more of a close relationship with one of their teachers, Night, and becomes enemies with another, Lancer.  Later on the two are assigned as partners to each other to work together.\n\nWhen Jet's boyfriend Samson is killed by The Everyman Society on what was supposed to be a safe training exercise, the two start to drift apart as Jet gains early sponsorship from New Chicago for her funeral speech and immerses herself in her school work.  The two finally start to patch things up when Jet is sent to talk to Iridium who is upset because Frostbite has been sent to therapy for being in a homosexual relationship.\n\nDuring their final exam, where the teams have to collect gang flags from certain points through a town, Iridium falls from the vehicle and Jet is ordered back to fill the report in person.  As Iridium starts to walk toward a place she can get back to the academy from, she comes across a rapist attacking a prostitute who is off duty and refusing.  Iridium interrupts, letting the prostitute escape, and is attacked by the rapist, whom she kills, then turns the body over to the police.\n\nAfter Iridium's actions, it is decided that the young woman will be sent to therapy.  Jet, hearing this, fears for what it will do to her friend and does not think she will survive it.  She stops the people and makes a deal, having Iridium sent to Blackbird penetentary instead.  Just before the transfer, Jet sneaks in to talk to Iridium, who attacks her friend, feeling Jet betrayed the friendship, and escapes.  Iridium is labeled as a Rabid as she disappears, working toward her own goals in a section of New Chicago called Wrecked City.  Jet graduates, becoming the official superhero of New Chicago.\n\nFive years later, Iridium is spotted after robbing a bank, and Jet goes after her.  The two fight, ending in Iridium escaping with the money.  Jet ends up fighting a street gang when her new runner, Bruce Hunter, arrives.  Jet finds herself attracted to him and scolds herself some for thinking like that.  After an embarrassing appearance on the Jack Goldwater show, Night contacts Jet and asks her to look for Lynda Kidder, as a favor, implies that Corp-Co may not want the reporter found, which Jet has a hard time believing.\n\nAfter dealing with a local gangster who is not playing by her rules, Iridium meets with the leader of a gang called the Undergoths and learns of a vigilante working in her area who she confronts.  After fighting, she ends up concluding to partner with him as he seems to be of use in her plan to take down the Ops computer system.\n\nAs Jet is led down into the underground to find Lynda Kidder, Irridium and the vigilante, Taser, enter the underground to find access to the building where the blueprints of The Academy would be kept.  The pair come across Jet fighting Lynda who had been turned into a heavily muscled monster with a simple mind.  After defeating the monstrous Lynda, Jet attacks Iridium, believing that the former friend was somehow involved in what had happened to the reporter.  Iridium tries to talk sense into Jet, who won't listen, then ends up knocking the hero out and getting away.\n\nJet is shortly found by Bruce and taken to a hospital.  Her injuries are healed rapidly by a faith healer, but she is forced to spend two weeks having bed rest.  A prospect she does not fully enjoy.  Two days before she would be cleared, Jet is caught by Bruce at the window after stopping a purse snatching, and the two end up sleeping together.  Jet tries to tell Night the truth about Iridium not being involved in what happened to Lynda, but the former mentor will not listen, and mentions that Corp-Co has a deal with the Everyman Society.  Jet ends up realizing that somehow, Corp-Co has managed to brainwash her some without her knowing.\n\nAfter warning a friend of hers, Iridium, along with Taser, shuts down the back up power, then head to the headquarters for the superheroes.  The two shut off the power, then head up to the Academy, working through until they reach Ops.
