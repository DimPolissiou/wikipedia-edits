[[Myron W. Reed]], Msgr. William J. O\u2019Ryan, Dean H. Martyn Hart, and Rabbi William S. Friedman put together an idea that became the nation's first united campaign, benefiting 10&nbsp;area health and welfare agencies. They created an organization to collect the funds for local charities, to coordinate relief services, to counsel and refer clients to cooperating agencies, and to make emergency assistance grants for cases that could not be referred. That year, Denver raised $21,700 for this greater good, and created a movement that would become United Way.  In the mid 1900s local United Ways founded a national organization, later called [[United Way of America]].

Since 1990, United Ways have been created in 25 additional countries.\n\nUnited Ways worldwide are led by local volunteers and professional leadership. In communities around the world, the United Way model is to convene local leaders to identify needs and create strategies that allow individuals and families to experience economic and human success through striving for the health, education and financial stability  of every person in every community.

United Way\u2019s Global Results Framework offers a data-driven snapshot of its global impact \u2013 including a snapshot of its work in financial stability, education and health.\n\n== United Way in France ==\nUnited Way Tocqueville (UWT) was created in France in 2008 as a non-profit organization, and forms part of the largest private charitable organization in the world, United Way Worldwide. UWT's ambition is to gather together the economic, political and social leaders to initiate collective community efforts to solve social problems.\n\nUnited Way France mobilizes corporations, volunteers and public institutions around education programs for junior-high school students. Their main actions include:\n* Mobilizing volunteers and raising funds to support non-profit organizations and projects\t\n* Bringing together all stakeholders of a community (non-profit organizations, corporations, individuals, donors, elected officials, etc.) around innovative social projects\n* Accompanying companies in the development of their social initiatives and the achievement of sustainability\n* Raising awareness among people and corporations about the values of mutual aid and local community involvement\n\nUnited Way France and the [[Airbus]] Corporate Foundation  launched in 2011 the Flying Challenge Program to support and inspire youth.\n\nAirbus employees and college students tutor middle school and high school students, in order to help them succeed at school and develop their awareness of the importance of their orientation choices and potential career.\n\n== United Way New Zealand ==\n{{Main|United Way New Zealand}}\nUnited Way New Zealand (UWNZ), officially known as United Way (NZ) Inc., was established in 1975 as the United Way of [[Auckland Region|Greater Auckland]]. In 1998, the geographic scope of the organization was expanded, and the name was changed to reflect the new national focus.\n\n== United Way's 211 and disaster response ==\n\nIn 2000, we joined with the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems to successfully petition the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to designate [https://www.unitedway.org/our-impact/featured-programs/2-1-1 211] as a health and human services information hotline. Originally created by United Way of [[Atlanta]], [[2-1-1]] is an easy-to- remember and universally recognizable telephone number. Like [[9-1-1|911]] and [[4-1-1|411]], it helped people reach out in times of crisis to find local support and services. \n\nIn the years that followed, 2-1-1 grew into an essential post-disaster resource, providing emergency assistance for victims of 9-11 and relief for communities devastated by hurricanes, floods, mudslides, tornadoes and man-made disasters in the U.S.  On the other side of the globe, United Way coordinated efforts to help [[Indian Ocean]] communities in the wake of [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004\u2019s tragic tsunami in South Asia]].\nWhen communities face disaster, United Way plays a key role in helping people from all walks of life rebuild. From ensuring first responders can act swiftly to leading long-term recovery, United Way addresses even the most devastating events. United Way's primary role in times of disaster is in long-term recovery, which can take 3-5 years.\n \nIn times of disaster and every day, 211 is a community\u2019s go-to resource. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 211 specialists connect callers with the help they need, from emergency shelter and evacuation information to help with basic needs, like food. During times of disaster, 211 maintains up-to-date information on shelters and other essential resources. During hurricanes [[Tropical Storm Florence|Florence]] and [[Hurricane Michael|Michael]] in 2018, people contacted United Way\u2019s 211 service to ask about food, shelter, evacuation zones, road closures, and other needs.\n\nIn 2017-18, the United Way Network raised more than $86.53 million for long-term recovery efforts related to [[Hurricane Harvey]], Hurricanes [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]]/[[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] and the [[2017 Mexico earthquake (disambiguation)|2017 earthquakes in Mexico]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedway.org/recovery|title=United Way Disaster Recovery {{!}} United Way Worldwide|website=www.unitedway.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\nAlmost $55.21 million has been raised for Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts\nAlmost $30 million has been raised for Hurricane Irma/Maria recovery efforts\nAlmost $1.4 million has been raised for Mexico Earthquake recovery efforts\nAlmost $266,000 has been designated for where the money is most needed\n\nUnited Way's local organization in [[Chile]], along with other United Way organizations throughout [[Latin America]] have mobilized to respond to the [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake that hit Chile]] on February 27, 2010.

The [[Central Community Chest of Japan]] has helped provide supplies to volunteer centers including: bicycles, mattresses, cell phones, and laptops. Additional supplies requested by the volunteer centers include motorbikes, prefab houses and tents, copy and fax machines, PCs and printers.\n\nThe Central Community Chest of Japan is collaborating with 43 affiliated non-profit organizations through the Council for Disaster Relief Project for Volunteers.

The game's development was funded partially through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.  ''Cosmic Star Heroine'' was released in April 2017 for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms; it was later ported to the [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Cosmic Star Heroine'' is a role-playing game where the player recruits up to 11 playable characters, and chooses a party of four to go into combat with enemies.  There are no random battles; combat takes place on the field like in ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', with visible enemies and bosses.  These encounters do not respawn, but if a player desires to \"grind\" for more [[Level (role-playing games)|levels]] and money, they can start additional battles at any time with as a VR battle, somewhat similar to the ability in ''[[Cthulhu Saves the World]]'' to force an encounter.  Rather than using traditional [[magic (gaming)|MP]], a unique charge-based system is used.  In battle, each character sets up to 7 abilities and a rest/defend type ability; in general, once an ability is used, it cannot be used again until the defend ability is used, which recharges all spent abilities.  Additionally, each character has a specific pattern for gaining \"Hyper\" turns wherein their abilities are drastically more effective.  This makes it so that \"spamming\" the most powerful ability is less effective due to needing to spend a turn resting to recharge it; the gameplay is based around setting up buffs and debuffs, then using powerful abilities on Hyper turns.  [[Status effect]]s also operate on a \"reliable\" basis, rather than having a percentage chance of success, but enemies also increase status ailment resistance after being inflicted with an ailment.  Characters, both PCs and enemies, also have a Style gauge that starts at 100% and increases with most actions.  Style acts as a multiplier increasing damage done.  Style can be lost via near-death and death, as well as certain powerful \"Burst\" moves that reset Style to 100%.  This acts similar to mechanics in earlier games made by Zeboyd that increase the tension and damage dealt the longer a fight persists.  The game has four difficulty settings which can freely be changed between in-game; enemies are tougher and deal more damage on the higher difficult settings.\n\nThe party can explore 3 planets, which contain both towns and dangerous combat-focused areas.  Araenu has a cyberpunk theme, with megacorporations, slums, clubs, and secret bases; Rhomu has a wild-west theme, with saloons, casinos, gunslinging, all underground after war devastated the surface; and Nuluup is a green and verdant planet with mysterious astral powers and a large population of reanimated souls of the dead.  There is a base upgrading system similar to the one from the ''[[Suikoden]]'' series, in which NPCs can be recruited to join the starship flagship of Alyssa's force.  Some of these NPCs can also offer bonuses and indirect support to the player's party in battle.  There are a variety of sidequests as well, optional content the party can pursue for additional plot scenes and equipment.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe adventure follows Alyssa L'Salle, an agent of the Agency of Peace & Intelligence (API).  An API mission to an abandoned research lab on Rhomu leads to two revelations: the rival terrorist organization Astrea also arrives at the same time, and the incomplete remnants of a \"Project Lumina\" research project guarded by berserk beasts.  Alyssa's allies discover that Project Lumina seems to be the foundation for a [[mind control]] device.  Director Steele, the head of the API, plans on using Lumina to impose order across the galaxy.  Alyssa and her friends defect from the API and seek out the aid of Astrea and its leader, Arete.  Steele's faction of the API attempts to perfect Lumina, while Alyssa and Astrea attempt to gain allies and build a counter-device to protect against Lumina's influence.  Alyssa also steals the API's flagship and makes it her own mobile base to investigate a spate of recent incidents: dark energy monsters roaming loose, kidnappings, and mysterious attacks.  Eventually, Alyssa's force defeats Steele, himself driven mad by Lumina's dark influence.  The victory is short-lived; Arete is revealed to also have been under the influence of Lumina's true master the whole time, having subtly influenced her followers to join Astrea, and she combines her own essence of the Lumina device with the Lumina device recovered from Rhomu to resurrect an ancient evil god.  Alyssa and her party defeat both Arete and the awoken dark god at its alien starship before they can overwhelm the galaxy.\n\n==Development and release==\nZeboyd Games officially announced their new upcoming title as ''Cosmic Star Heroine'' in June 2013.

The game's development was funded partially through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.  ''Cosmic Star Heroine'' was released in April 2017 for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms; it was later ported to the [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Cosmic Star Heroine'' is a role-playing game where the player recruits up to 11 playable characters, and chooses a party of four to go into combat with enemies.  There are no random battles; combat takes place on the field like in ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', with visible enemies and bosses.  These encounters do not respawn, but if a player desires to \"grind\" for more [[Level (role-playing games)|levels]] and money, they can start additional battles at any time with as a VR battle, somewhat similar to the ability in ''[[Cthulhu Saves the World]]'' to force an encounter.  Rather than using traditional [[magic (gaming)|MP]], a unique charge-based system is used.  In battle, each character sets up to 7 abilities and a rest/defend type ability; in general, once an ability is used, it cannot be used again until the defend ability is used, which recharges all spent abilities.  Additionally, each character has a specific pattern for gaining \"Hyper\" turns wherein their abilities are drastically more effective.  This makes it so that \"spamming\" the most powerful ability is less effective due to needing to spend a turn resting to recharge it; the gameplay is based around setting up buffs and debuffs, then using powerful abilities on Hyper turns.  [[Status effect]]s also operate on a \"reliable\" basis, rather than having a percentage chance of success, but enemies also increase status ailment resistance after being inflicted with an ailment.  Characters, both PCs and enemies, also have a Style gauge that starts at 100% and increases with most actions.  Style acts as a multiplier increasing damage done.  Style can be lost via near-death and death, as well as certain powerful \"Burst\" moves that reset Style to 100%.  This acts similar to mechanics in earlier games made by Zeboyd that increase the tension and damage dealt the longer a fight persists.  The game has four difficulty settings which can freely be changed between in-game; enemies are tougher and deal more damage on the higher difficult settings.  \n\nThe party can explore 3 planets, which contain both towns and dangerous combat-focused areas.  Araenu has a cyberpunk theme, with megacorporations, slums, clubs, and secret bases; Rhomu has a wild-west theme, with saloons, casinos, gunslinging, all underground after war devastated the surface; and Nuluup is a green and verdant planet with mysterious astral powers and a large population of reanimated souls of the dead.  There is a base upgrading system similar to the one from the ''[[Suikoden]]'' series, in which NPCs can be recruited to join the starship flagship of Alyssa's force.  Some of these NPCs can also offer bonuses and indirect support to the player's party in battle.  There are a variety of sidequests as well, optional content the party can pursue for additional plot scenes and equipment.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe adventure follows Alyssa L'Salle, an agent of the Agency of Peace & Intelligence (API).  An API mission to an abandoned research lab on Rhomu leads to two revelations: the rival terrorist organization Astrea also arrives at the same time, and the incomplete remnants of a \"Project Lumina\" research project guarded by berserk beasts.  Alyssa's allies discover that Project Lumina seems to be the foundation for a [[mind control]] device.  Director Steele, the head of the API, plans on using Lumina to impose order across the galaxy.  Alyssa and her friends defect from the API and seek out the aid of Astrea and its leader, Arete.  Steele's faction of the API attempts to perfect Lumina, while Alyssa and Astrea attempt to gain allies and build a counter-device to protect against Lumina's influence.  Alyssa also steals the API's flagship and makes it her own mobile base to investigate a spate of recent incidents: dark energy monsters roaming loose, kidnappings, and mysterious attacks.  Eventually, Alyssa's force defeats Steele, himself driven mad by Lumina's dark influence.  The victory is short-lived; Arete is revealed to also have been under the influence of Lumina's true master the whole time, having subtly influenced her followers to join Astrea, and she combines her own essence of the Lumina device with the Lumina device recovered from Rhomu to resurrect an ancient evil god.  Alyssa and her party defeat both Arete and the awoken dark god at its alien starship before they can overwhelm the galaxy.\n\n==Development and release==\nZeboyd Games officially announced their new upcoming title as ''Cosmic Star Heroine'' in June 2013.

The series was shot in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. It is the first [[Disney Channel Original Series]] to be shot in [[16:9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH9RxnfOdaA|title=So Weird \u2013 Intro (Widescreen)|first=|last=disneyww|date=13 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> In the first two seasons, the series centered on teenage girl Fiona Phillips ([[Cara DeLizia]]) who toured with her rock-star mom ([[Mackenzie Phillips]]), while encountering [[paranormal]] activity along the way. The series was compared to the Fox TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' since it took a darker tone than any other Disney Channel show at the time. For the third and final season, Disney replaced DeLizia (due to her wanting to pursue future projects outside of Disney) with actress [[Alexz Johnson]] playing Annie Thelen. Production ceased after 65 episodes.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nThe season began with Fiona Phillips on tour with her famous rocker mother Molly, brother Jack, a skeptic, bus driver Ned, his wife Irene, and their son Clu. Stringing together all of Fi's paranormal encounters was her search to communicate with her father, who died when she was three years old. Fi first \"encountered\" her father in the second episode titled \"Web Sight\" where an unknown force sent her [[internet]] articles warning her of the future. From [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] invasions, time warps, and [[ghosts]], Fi faced 13 episodes worth of paranormal activity. Also encountered: one powerful [[Thoughtform|tulpa]], a [[Bigfoot]], [[angels]], and more significantly, the [[Will o' the Wisp]]. The season finale featured Jack becoming possessed by a hyperactive Scottish will o' the wisp, also known as a Spunkie. The Spunkie told Fi she could save her brother from his control by speaking his one true name, which was only seven letters. Fi found the spirit's one true name, [[Bricriu]], therefore saving her brother. Bricriu had offered to protect Fi from evil spirits who had battled her father and had also offered to give her contact with her late father in return for being allowed to possess her brother. She thought he was lying therefore rejected his offer. He reappears in later episodes to keep her away from other spirits and people who claims are a threat to her, depending on how one reads it, this may be seen as evidence he was telling the truth, but this is questionable at best, especially since in one episode he tried to prevent her from talking to a person who knew her father and wanted to give her information.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nThe second season was even darker than the first, playing out over twenty-six episodes. The premiere picked up with Molly taking time off the tour to record an [[album]]. Fi and friend Candy meet a [[Spiritual medium|medium]] who is proven to be a fraud. However, the one who uncovers the fake is actually a medium himself who aids Fi in contacting her father through music on his old guitar.\n\nThe character of Clu was reduced during the season, as he went off to college, and his brother Carey was introduced to fill in the gap. Many legendary creatures surfaced within the season, including [[vampires]], [[werewolves]], [[banshees]], [[trolls]], [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], and [[Mermaid|merfolk]]. In a pivotal episode, Fi learned that her father investigated the same kinds of [[supernatural]] events that Fi did. In fact, this was exactly what led to his death. Upon learning this, Fi is angered by her mother's deceit in covering up the truth about her father. Molly was eventually possessed by Bricriu, the same [[Will o' the Wisp]] as Jack was in season one. Fi discovered that Will o' the Wisps or other dark powers, though not necessarily Bricriu himself, may have killed her father, resulting in the accident that police had assumed took his life. In this episode Bricriu tried to kill a former firefighter who had been present at Rick's car crash and was aware that Fi's dad had been dead, with no apparent cause, before the car crashed. Following this episode, Fi had further contact with her father, as the answer to a troll's question \u2013 Faith \u2013 was revealed on her computer and a plethora of cell phones. Fi briefly time traveled to her third year, when her father was still alive, in episode 13, ''Fountain''.\n\nThe season ended with Fi discovering her father's twin sister received encoded messages from him in her sleep. The messages led Fi to a rooftop where she was attacked by a three-headed [[demon]] and saved by the ghost of her father. He left her with a message that the spirit world was angry with her and would try to stop her investigation about the paranormal. At last, Fi got the proper farewell to her father that she had been searching for. Many DeLizia fans consider this a proper, if not entirely fulfilling, finale.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{POV-section|date=March 2018}}\nAfter skewing somewhat dark and intricate in its second season, the show was forced into a lighter tone for its final batch of episodes. Cara DeLizia left after the first episode, which introduced family friend Annie Thelen. Fi had yet another encounter with [[Bricriu]]. In this episode her family turn into plants and animals and Fi has to go to Bricriu for help in saving them. He does and then he convinces her to give up investigating the occult to save her family, whom the spirit world threatened because of its anger at Fi's intrusions. Fi, who still didn't trust Bricriu even though he claimed he was trying to help, trapped him in a floppy disk. The attraction to the occult, manifested in the ring her father gave her, was passed on to Annie as Fi went to live with her aunt in Seattle. Molly moved the family to a new, brightly colored house.\n\nAnnie's [[story arc]] was the mystery behind a spirit guide that followed her in the form of a [[Black panther#Black Jaguar|panther]]. Her character was also musically talented, and episodes featured more of her singing than that of the older Mackenzie Phillips. The season's stories were a far cry from previous episodes, playing such plots as being sucked into a [[painting]] (which directly followed an episode of people being sucked into [[photographs]]), a stone from the [[Tower of Babel]] that causes [[xenoglossy]], a recording studio owner who saps musical talent from the musicians who rent out her studio and gives the talent to her daughter (who doesn't want to steal others' talents to be famous), a loner boy who uses the power of magnetism to be popular, and a [[Detention (Academia)|detention]] class that traps people in time. Cara DeLizia never reappeared in the season, however Fi was still prevalent in many episodes via e-mail. She made a brief appearance in the episode \"Earth 101\" by a lookalike, and in the final episode, although in the final it was only a rerun clip from the first episode of the season. The mystery of the panther was solved: when Annie was three and living in the Amazon she saved a young tribesman at risk to her own life. His tribe, in turn, saved her and his father took on the form of the panther to always protect her as thanks for her selfless act.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main article|List of So Weird episodes}}\n{{:List of So Weird Episodes}}\n\n== Main characters ==\n<!-- Note: episode counts are against guidelines set at WP:TVCAST -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!rowspan=2 style=|Actor\n!rowspan=2 style=|Character\n!colspan=3 |Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|[[List of So Weird episodes#Season 1|1]]\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|[[List of So Weird episodes#Season 2|2]]\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|[[List of So Weird episodes#Season 3|3]]\n|-\n| [[Cara DeLizia]] || Fiona 'Fi' Phillips || colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}} || colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest|Guest}}\n|-\n| [[Mackenzie Phillips]] || Molly Phillips || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Patrick Levis ]] || Jack Phillips || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Erik von Detten]] || Clu Bell || colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}} || colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest|Guest}}\n|-\n| [[Belinda Metz]] ||Irene Bell || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}} \n|-\n| [[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]] || Ned Bell || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Eric Lively]] || Carey Bell || colspan=\"1\" {{N/A|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Alexz Johnson]] || Annie Thelen || colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n|}\n\n<!-- List cast in order of the series' credits, and in order of appearance on the series, as per [[WP:TVCAST]] -->\n* [[Cara DeLizia]] as Fiona 'Fi' Phillips (seasons 1\u20132; guest star, season 3) \u2013 In nearly every episode, Fi sets up a website called ''So Weird''. On this website, she posts her strange experiences and finds a community that shares her belief in the paranormal. Fi has a vast knowledge of all things paranormal and an eye for detail. In \"Strangeling\" and \"Banshee,\" it is hinted that she is part witch on her grandmother's side. In \"OOPA\", it is shown that she has a psychic connection to an ancient computing device from Atlantis. Fi lost her father in a car accident when she was three years old. In \"Strange Geometry\", Fi learns that her father was obsessed with the same weird things that she investigates. The [[will-o'-the-wisp]] known as Bricriu says that this may have led to his death in \"Destiny\". Fi's father's death and its increasingly mysterious circumstances act as a double season-long story arc over seasons 1 and 2. She left at the beginning of season 3 to live with her aunt and try to have a \"normal life\".\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Molly Phillips \u2013 Fi and Jack's mother, widow of Rick Phillips, and a singer-songwriter. She opened once in \"Encore\" instead of Fi. Molly had a bit of a rocky relationship with her father, apparently starting when she was a rebellious teenager. She wrote a song about him called \"The Rock\" in \"Banshee\" to make peace with him. She kept the knowledge that Rick also investigated paranormal activity secret from Fi, saying \"he became obsessed with it\". She doesn't share Fi's strong belief in the paranormal, but she does support her daughter. Bricriu possessed her in \"Destiny\" to stop Fi from learning the truth about her father's accident and supposedly to also protect her mother from the spirit world. But the part about protecting Fi is questionable since he goes so far as trapping a pyrophobiac mechanic (who pulled Rick from the car the day of his death) and Fi in a burning building.\n* [[Patrick Levis]] as Jack Phillips \u2013 Although he is Fi's older brother, Jack doesn't believe in paranormal activity and is the series' most staunch skeptic. Jack is very protective of Fi, as well as Molly as seen in \"Fathom.\" He once opened the show in the episode \"Avatar\" instead of Fi, and opened the episode \"Dead Ringer\" instead of Annie. Bricriu possessed him in \"Will o' the Wisp\" to supposedly \"protect\" Fi from others in the spirit world, others who didn't like her investigations of the paranormal. He meets his girlfriend Gabe in \"Angels\", whom he keeps in touch with long-distance and went to visit in \"Fall\".\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as Clu Bell (season 1; guest star, season 3) \u2013 Carey's younger brother, Ned and Irene's son, Clu is more accepting of Fi's paranormal theories. She often takes him along when investigating. He got into college in \"Mutiny\". He tends to have a rather goofy laid-back attitude, much like his brother Carey but more so. Still, he can be rather responsible such as when he helped Jack study for his driver's license in \"Rebecca\".\n* [[Belinda Metz]] as Irene Bell \u2013 Molly's band manager. She has a younger sister with whom she never got along after she washed her \"ratty stuffed bunny\" and made it into a \"clean soft bunny\", a brother-in-law named Kevin, and a young nephew named Danny, who pulled Clu, Fi, and Jack into his dreams because he wanted help to deal with \"the monster\" (it turned out he was having nightmares because of his parents constant fighting, something they resolved to try to fix for Danny's sake) in \"Nightmare\".\n* [[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]] as Ned Bell \u2013 Drives Molly's tour bus; he was possessed by a claustrophobic sea captain in \"Mutiny\". He went home to visit his childhood friend Sam, who was being haunted by a vision of their friend Pete, who had died in a bad fall over river rocks. He was Fi's, Clu's, and Jack's home school teacher while on the road. In \"Troll\", he mentions he has Viking ancestors.\n* [[Eric Lively]] as Carey Bell (seasons 2\u20133) \u2013 Clu's older brother, he was introduced in \"Siren\". He goes along more with Fi's paranormal ideas, and sometimes comes up with his own, as shown in \"Avatar\". He dropped out of college and joined Molly's band against Irene's wishes in \"Listen\". \n* [[Alexz Johnson]] as Annie Thelen (season 3) \u2013 Family friend of the Phillips'. She moves in with the Phillips' after Fi leaves for her aunt's to try to have a \"normal life\". Fi gives Annie a ring that previously belonged to her father that serves as a gateway for Annie's adventure into the paranormal world. There is always a mysterious black panther around just as something 'weird' is happening, which she later finds out is her spirit guide.\n\n=== Cast changes and guest appearances ===\n* Erik von Detten was unavailable during the show's second season. While he was used in two network projects, the sitcom ''[[Odd Man Out (U.S. TV series)|Odd Man Out]]'' and the fantasy series ''[[Dinotopia]]'' (both aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), von Detten returned in the third season in several guest spots. Eric Lively meanwhile replaced him.\n* Despite many rumors, producers confirm that Cara DeLizia left after season two to pursue other projects before Disney had decided to revamp the show. DeLizia's departure was the first time that a Disney Channel original series' lead actor departed during its run (the only other series where this has occurred is ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', whose lead actress [[Demi Lovato]] left due to health issues). In the season three episode \"Earth 101,\" Fi's [[cameo appearance]] was done through past vocal footage and a look-alike stand-in. DeLizia had no part in the episode.\n* In the first episode Irene Bell was played by [[Teryl Rothery]].\n* [[The Moffatts]] made a guest appearance in the episode \"Destiny\". [[SHeDAISY]] made a guest appearance in the episode \"Listen\".\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] does not appear in two episodes of the series.\n* [[Bo Diddley]] appeared in the episode \"Blues\" as Frank.\n\n== Music of ''So Weird'' ==\nThe series featured original songs sung by both [[Mackenzie Phillips]] and [[Alexz Johnson]]. Songs sung by Mackenzie Phillips included the theme \"In the Darkness\", \"Another World\", \"Rebecca\", \"The Rock\" and \"Love is Broken\". Each of the songs usually tied into the theme of the episode they were featured in. For example, \"Rebecca\" was featured in the episode \"Rebecca\" which dealt with Molly's former best friend of the same name who vanished when she was 13 years old. A compilation of Molly's songs was featured in the episode \"Encore.\"\n\nDuring seasons one and two, a music video that starts out with a talking scene between Jack and Clu and then Molly asks them and Fi to go to bed while they act jovial and happy, was aired. It featured over 62 clips from seasons one and two. It was the song \"In the Darkness\". It starts out with Jack and Clu fooling around, Clu howling and someone strumming a guitar. Molly comes to them in the RV and tells them it is time for her second show and that means bed. Fi closes her computer and says goodnight. She looks sad. Jack hugs Molly goodnight. Clu tells Molly to \"knock em dead' or something or Break A Leg, Molly mocks his voice and says, \"Thank you Clu\" and shakes his hand. They leave. She goes out of the RV and starts to sing in a strange set.\n\n\"Last Night Blues,\" was the only occasion Cara DeLizia had to sing during her stint on the show. The song was supernaturally transferred to the characters from a murdered blues musician.\n\nSeason 3 mainly used the music of Alexz Johnson. One of Johnson's original songs, \"Dream About You\", was featured in the episode \"Carnival.\" A [[music video]] by Alexz Johnson, \"Shadows\", was also featured near the end of the show's run on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe following is an incomplete listing of music from ''So Weird''. With the exception of \"Lorena\" and occasional musical guest appearances, all music was original, created especially for the series.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Introduced in Season 1 ===\n* '''\"In the Darkness (Is The Light)\"'''\n:Short Version #1 - featured in the opening theme of Season 1\n:Season 1 Version - featured in the official music video, Sight and Singularity\n:Short Version #2 - featured in the opening theme of Seasons 2 and 3\n:Season 2 Version - featured in Second Generation and Encore\n:Bricriu's Version - featured in Destiny\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by [[Jon Cooksey]]''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"More Like a River\"'''\n:Acoustic Version - featured in Memory\n:Piano Version - featured in OOPA\n:Guitar Version - featured in Encore\n:''Music by [[Brent Belke]]''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"Rebecca\"'''\n:Guitar Version - featured in Rebecca\n:Piano Version - featured in Rebecca\n:Acoustic Version - featured in Siren\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"She Sells\"'''\n:Acoustic Version - featured in Tulpa, Drive and Second Generation\n:Original Version - featured in Drive and Encore\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n=== Introduced in Season 2 ===\n* '''\"Another World\"'''\n:David Steele's Version - featured in Medium and Fall\n:Mackenzie Phillips' Version - featured in Encore\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips/David Steele''\n\n* '''\"New Math\"'''\n:Featured in Listen, Blues, Fathom and The Muse\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"The Rock\"'''\n:Featured in Banshee\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"Last Night Blues\"'''\n:Featured in Blues\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n:Alternate Version \"Chicago Blues\" sung by Roger Ridley\n\n* '''\"Origami\"'''\n:Featured in Fathom\n:''Music by Jeff Neill & Mark Scott''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"Love Is Broken\"'''\n:Featured in Twins\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Arrangement by Jeff Neill & Mark Scott''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Introduced in Season 3 ===\n* '''\"One In A Million World\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips and Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"To Dream About You\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"Never Give Up\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"What You Do (Voodoo)\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"Thinkin' About Tomorrow\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"A Different Story\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"Push Me, Pull You\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"'Cause You're Watching Over Me (Shadows)\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"While I Stare\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n=== Other songs ===\n* '''\"Lorena\"''' (folk song fragment)\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"Star-Dot-Star\"''' (fictional [[jingle]])\n:Sung by cast (and by [[gremlin]]s)\n\n* '''\"Jack's Lullaby\"'''\n:Sung by Patrick Levis\n\n* '''\"Questions\"'''\n:Sung by [[Jewel Staite]]\n\n* '''\"Little Goodbyes\"'''\n:Sung by [[SheDaisy]]\n\n* '''\"Misery\"'''\n:Sung by [[The Moffatts]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Broadcast ==\nAfter 65 episodes, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] ceased production. After the show ended, reruns of the series were pushed further and further back in the schedule.

The series was shot in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. It is the first [[Disney Channel Original Series]] to be shot in [[16:9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH9RxnfOdaA|title=So Weird \u2013 Intro (Widescreen)|first=|last=disneyww|date=13 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> In the first two seasons, the series centered on teenage girl Fiona Phillips ([[Cara DeLizia]]) who toured with her rock-star mom ([[Mackenzie Phillips]]), while encountering [[paranormal]] activity along the way. The series was compared to the Fox TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' since it took a darker tone than any other Disney Channel show at the time. For the third and final season, Disney replaced DeLizia (due to her wanting to pursue future projects outside of Disney) with actress [[Alexz Johnson]] playing Annie Thelen. Production ceased after 65 episodes.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nThe season began with Fiona Phillips on tour with her famous rocker mother Molly, brother Jack, a skeptic, bus driver Ned, his wife Irene, and their son Clu. Stringing together all of Fi's paranormal encounters was her search to communicate with her father, who died when she was three years old. Fi first \"encountered\" her father in the second episode titled \"Web Sight\" where an unknown force sent her [[internet]] articles warning her of the future. From [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] invasions, time warps, and [[ghosts]], Fi faced 13 episodes worth of paranormal activity. Also encountered: one powerful [[Thoughtform|tulpa]], a [[Bigfoot]], [[angels]], and more significantly, the [[Will o' the Wisp]]. The season finale featured Jack becoming possessed by a hyperactive Scottish will o' the wisp, also known as a Spunkie. The Spunkie told Fi she could save her brother from his control by speaking his one true name, which was only seven letters. Fi found the spirit's one true name, [[Bricriu]], therefore saving her brother. Bricriu had offered to protect Fi from evil spirits who had battled her father and had also offered to give her contact with her late father in return for being allowed to possess her brother. She thought he was lying therefore rejected his offer. He reappears in later episodes to keep her away from other spirits and people who claims are a threat to her, depending on how one reads it, this may be seen as evidence he was telling the truth, but this is questionable at best, especially since in one episode he tried to prevent her from talking to a person who knew her father and wanted to give her information.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nThe second season was even darker than the first, playing out over twenty-six episodes. The premiere picked up with Molly taking time off the tour to record an [[album]]. Fi and friend Candy meet a [[Spiritual medium|medium]] who is proven to be a fraud. However, the one who uncovers the fake is actually a medium himself who aids Fi in contacting her father through music on his old guitar.\n\nThe character of Clu was reduced during the season, as he went off to college, and his brother Carey was introduced to fill in the gap. Many legendary creatures surfaced within the season, including [[vampires]], [[werewolves]], [[banshees]], [[trolls]], [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], and [[Mermaid|merfolk]]. In a pivotal episode, Fi learned that her father investigated the same kinds of [[supernatural]] events that Fi did. In fact, this was exactly what led to his death. Upon learning this, Fi is angered by her mother's deceit in covering up the truth about her father. Molly was eventually possessed by Bricriu, the same [[Will o' the Wisp]] as Jack was in season one. Fi discovered that Will o' the Wisps or other dark powers, though not necessarily Bricriu himself, may have killed her father, resulting in the accident that police had assumed took his life. In this episode Bricriu tried to kill a former firefighter who had been present at Rick's car crash and was aware that Fi's dad had been dead, with no apparent cause, before the car crashed. Following this episode, Fi had further contact with her father, as the answer to a troll's question \u2013 Faith \u2013 was revealed on her computer and a plethora of cell phones. Fi briefly time traveled to her third year, when her father was still alive, in episode 13, ''Fountain''.\n\nThe season ended with Fi discovering her father's twin sister received encoded messages from him in her sleep. The messages led Fi to a rooftop where she was attacked by a three-headed [[demon]] and saved by the ghost of her father. He left her with a message that the spirit world was angry with her and would try to stop her investigation about the paranormal. At last, Fi got the proper farewell to her father that she had been searching for. Many DeLizia fans consider this a proper, if not entirely fulfilling, finale.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{POV-section|date=March 2018}}\nAfter skewing somewhat dark and intricate in its second season, the show was forced into a lighter tone for its final batch of episodes. Cara DeLizia left after the first episode, which introduced family friend Annie Thelen. Fi had yet another encounter with [[Bricriu]]. In this episode her family turn into plants and animals and Fi has to go to Bricriu for help in saving them. He does and then he convinces her to give up investigating the occult to save her family, whom the spirit world threatened because of its anger at Fi's intrusions. Fi, who still didn't trust Bricriu even though he claimed he was trying to help, trapped him in a floppy disk. The attraction to the occult, manifested in the ring her father gave her, was passed on to Annie as Fi went to live with her aunt in Seattle. Molly moved the family to a new, brightly colored house.\n\nAnnie's [[story arc]] was the mystery behind a spirit guide that followed her in the form of a [[Black panther#Black Jaguar|panther]]. Her character was also musically talented, and episodes featured more of her singing than that of the older Mackenzie Phillips. The season's stories were a far cry from previous episodes, playing such plots as being sucked into a [[painting]] (which directly followed an episode of people being sucked into [[photographs]]), a stone from the [[Tower of Babel]] that causes [[xenoglossy]], a recording studio owner who saps musical talent from the musicians who rent out her studio and gives the talent to her daughter (who doesn't want to steal others' talents to be famous), a loner boy who uses the power of magnetism to be popular, and a [[Detention (Academia)|detention]] class that traps people in time. Cara DeLizia never reappeared in the season, however Fi was still prevalent in many episodes via e-mail. She made a brief appearance in the episode \"Earth 101\" by a lookalike, and in the final episode, although in the final it was only a rerun clip from the first episode of the season. The mystery of the panther was solved: when Annie was three and living in the Amazon she saved a young tribesman at risk to her own life. His tribe, in turn, saved her and his father took on the form of the panther to always protect her as thanks for her selfless act.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main article|List of So Weird episodes}}\n{{:List of So Weird Episodes}}\n\n== Main characters ==\n<!-- Note: episode counts are against guidelines set at WP:TVCAST -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!rowspan=2 style=|Actor\n!rowspan=2 style=|Character\n!colspan=3 |Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|[[List of So Weird episodes#Season 1|1]]\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|[[List of So Weird episodes#Season 2|2]]\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|[[List of So Weird episodes#Season 3|3]]\n|-\n| [[Cara DeLizia]] || Fiona 'Fi' Phillips || colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}} || colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest|Guest}}\n|-\n| [[Mackenzie Phillips]] || Molly Phillips || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Patrick Levis ]] || Jack Phillips || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Erik von Detten]] || Clu Bell || colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}} || colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest|Guest}}\n|-\n| [[Belinda Metz]] ||Irene Bell || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}} \n|-\n| [[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]] || Ned Bell || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Eric Lively]] || Carey Bell || colspan=\"1\" {{N/A|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| [[Alexz Johnson]] || Annie Thelen || colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n|}\n\n<!-- List cast in order of the series' credits, and in order of appearance on the series, as per [[WP:TVCAST]] -->\n* [[Cara DeLizia]] as Fiona 'Fi' Phillips (seasons 1\u20132; guest star, season 3) \u2013 In nearly every episode, Fi sets up a website called ''So Weird''.

Fi's father's death and its increasingly mysterious circumstances act as a double season-long story arc over seasons 1 and 2. She left at the beginning of season 3 to live with her aunt and try to have a \"normal life\".\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Molly Phillips \u2013 Fi and Jack's mother, widow of Rick Phillips, and a singer-songwriter. She opened once in \"Encore\" instead of Fi. Molly had a bit of a rocky relationship with her father, apparently starting when she was a rebellious teenager. She wrote a song about him called \"The Rock\" in \"Banshee\" to make peace with him. She kept the knowledge that Rick also investigated paranormal activity secret from Fi, saying \"he became obsessed with it\". She doesn't share Fi's strong belief in the paranormal, but she does support her daughter. Bricriu possessed her in \"Destiny\" to stop Fi from learning the truth about her father's accident and supposedly to also protect her mother from the spirit world. But the part about protecting Fi is questionable since he goes so far as trapping a pyrophobiac mechanic (who pulled Rick from the car the day of his death) and Fi in a burning building.\n* [[Patrick Levis]] as Jack Phillips \u2013 Although he is Fi's older brother, Jack doesn't believe in paranormal activity and is the series' most staunch skeptic. Jack is very protective of Fi, as well as Molly as seen in \"Fathom.\" He once opened the show in the episode \"Avatar\" instead of Fi, and opened the episode \"Dead Ringer\" instead of Annie. Bricriu possessed him in \"Will o' the Wisp\" to supposedly \"protect\" Fi from others in the spirit world, others who didn't like her investigations of the paranormal. He meets his girlfriend Gabe in \"Angels\", whom he keeps in touch with long-distance and went to visit in \"Fall\".\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as Clu Bell (season 1; guest star, season 3) \u2013 Carey's younger brother, Ned and Irene's son, Clu is more accepting of Fi's paranormal theories. She often takes him along when investigating. He got into college in \"Mutiny\". He tends to have a rather goofy laid-back attitude, much like his brother Carey but more so. Still, he can be rather responsible such as when he helped Jack study for his driver's license in \"Rebecca\".\n* [[Belinda Metz]] as Irene Bell \u2013 Molly's band manager. She has a younger sister with whom she never got along after she washed her \"ratty stuffed bunny\" and made it into a \"clean soft bunny\", a brother-in-law named Kevin, and a young nephew named Danny, who pulled Clu, Fi, and Jack into his dreams because he wanted help to deal with \"the monster\" (it turned out he was having nightmares because of his parents constant fighting, something they resolved to try to fix for Danny's sake) in \"Nightmare\".\n* [[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]] as Ned Bell \u2013 Drives Molly's tour bus; he was possessed by a claustrophobic sea captain in \"Mutiny\". He went home to visit his childhood friend Sam, who was being haunted by a vision of their friend Pete, who had died in a bad fall over river rocks. He was Fi's, Clu's, and Jack's home school teacher while on the road. In \"Troll\", he mentions he has Viking ancestors.\n* [[Eric Lively]] as Carey Bell (seasons 2\u20133) \u2013 Clu's older brother, he was introduced in \"Siren\". He goes along more with Fi's paranormal ideas, and sometimes comes up with his own, as shown in \"Avatar\". He dropped out of college and joined Molly's band against Irene's wishes in \"Listen\". \n* [[Alexz Johnson]] as Annie Thelen (season 3) \u2013 Family friend of the Phillips'. She moves in with the Phillips' after Fi leaves for her aunt's to try to have a \"normal life\". Fi gives Annie a ring that previously belonged to her father that serves as a gateway for Annie's adventure into the paranormal world. There is always a mysterious black panther around just as something 'weird' is happening, which she later finds out is her spirit guide.\n\n=== Cast changes and guest appearances ===\n* Erik von Detten was unavailable during the show's second season. While he was used in two network projects, the sitcom ''[[Odd Man Out (U.S. TV series)|Odd Man Out]]'' and the fantasy series ''[[Dinotopia]]'' (both aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), von Detten returned in the third season in several guest spots. Eric Lively meanwhile replaced him.\n* Despite many rumors, producers confirm that Cara DeLizia left after season two to pursue other projects before Disney had decided to revamp the show. DeLizia's departure was the first time that a Disney Channel original series' lead actor departed during its run (the only other series where this has occurred is ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', whose lead actress [[Demi Lovato]] left due to health issues). In the season three episode \"Earth 101,\" Fi's [[cameo appearance]] was done through past vocal footage and a look-alike stand-in. DeLizia had no part in the episode.\n* In the first episode Irene Bell was played by [[Teryl Rothery]].\n* [[The Moffatts]] made a guest appearance in the episode \"Destiny\". [[SHeDAISY]] made a guest appearance in the episode \"Listen\".\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] does not appear in two episodes of the series.\n* [[Bo Diddley]] appeared in the episode \"Blues\" as Frank.\n\n== Music of ''So Weird'' ==\nThe series featured original songs sung by both [[Mackenzie Phillips]] and [[Alexz Johnson]]. Songs sung by Mackenzie Phillips included the theme \"In the Darkness\", \"Another World\", \"Rebecca\", \"The Rock\" and \"Love is Broken\". Each of the songs usually tied into the theme of the episode they were featured in. For example, \"Rebecca\" was featured in the episode \"Rebecca\" which dealt with Molly's former best friend of the same name who vanished when she was 13 years old. A compilation of Molly's songs was featured in the episode \"Encore.\"\n\nDuring seasons one and two, a music video that starts out with a talking scene between Jack and Clu and then Molly asks them and Fi to go to bed while they act jovial and happy, was aired. It featured over 62 clips from seasons one and two. It was the song \"In the Darkness\". It starts out with Jack and Clu fooling around, Clu howling and someone strumming a guitar. Molly comes to them in the RV and tells them it is time for her second show and that means bed. Fi closes her computer and says goodnight. She looks sad. Jack hugs Molly goodnight. Clu tells Molly to \"knock em dead' or something or Break A Leg, Molly mocks his voice and says, \"Thank you Clu\" and shakes his hand. They leave. She goes out of the RV and starts to sing in a strange set.\n\n\"Last Night Blues,\" was the only occasion Cara DeLizia had to sing during her stint on the show. The song was supernaturally transferred to the characters from a murdered blues musician.\n\nSeason 3 mainly used the music of Alexz Johnson. One of Johnson's original songs, \"Dream About You\", was featured in the episode \"Carnival.\" A [[music video]] by Alexz Johnson, \"Shadows\", was also featured near the end of the show's run on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe following is an incomplete listing of music from ''So Weird''. With the exception of \"Lorena\" and occasional musical guest appearances, all music was original, created especially for the series.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Introduced in Season 1 ===\n* '''\"In the Darkness (Is The Light)\"'''\n:Short Version #1 - featured in the opening theme of Season 1\n:Season 1 Version - featured in the official music video, Sight and Singularity\n:Short Version #2 - featured in the opening theme of Seasons 2 and 3\n:Season 2 Version - featured in Second Generation and Encore\n:Bricriu's Version - featured in Destiny\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by [[Jon Cooksey]]''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"More Like a River\"'''\n:Acoustic Version - featured in Memory\n:Piano Version - featured in OOPA\n:Guitar Version - featured in Encore\n:''Music by [[Brent Belke]]''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"Rebecca\"'''\n:Guitar Version - featured in Rebecca\n:Piano Version - featured in Rebecca\n:Acoustic Version - featured in Siren\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"She Sells\"'''\n:Acoustic Version - featured in Tulpa, Drive and Second Generation\n:Original Version - featured in Drive and Encore\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n=== Introduced in Season 2 ===\n* '''\"Another World\"'''\n:David Steele's Version - featured in Medium and Fall\n:Mackenzie Phillips' Version - featured in Encore\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips/David Steele''\n\n* '''\"New Math\"'''\n:Featured in Listen, Blues, Fathom and The Muse\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"The Rock\"'''\n:Featured in Banshee\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"Last Night Blues\"'''\n:Featured in Blues\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n:Alternate Version \"Chicago Blues\" sung by Roger Ridley\n\n* '''\"Origami\"'''\n:Featured in Fathom\n:''Music by Jeff Neill & Mark Scott''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n* '''\"Love Is Broken\"'''\n:Featured in Twins\n:''Music by Annmarie Montade''\n:''Lyrics by Jon Cooksey''\n:''Arrangement by Jeff Neill & Mark Scott''\n:''Sung by Mackenzie Phillips''\n\n\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Introduced in Season 3 ===\n* '''\"One In A Million World\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips and Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"To Dream About You\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"Never Give Up\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"What You Do (Voodoo)\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"Thinkin' About Tomorrow\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"A Different Story\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"Push Me, Pull You\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"'Cause You're Watching Over Me (Shadows)\"'''\n:Sung by Alexz Johnson\n\n* '''\"While I Stare\"'''\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n=== Other songs ===\n* '''\"Lorena\"''' (folk song fragment)\n:Sung by Mackenzie Phillips\n\n* '''\"Star-Dot-Star\"''' (fictional [[jingle]])\n:Sung by cast (and by [[gremlin]]s)\n\n* '''\"Jack's Lullaby\"'''\n:Sung by Patrick Levis\n\n* '''\"Questions\"'''\n:Sung by [[Jewel Staite]]\n\n* '''\"Little Goodbyes\"'''\n:Sung by [[SheDaisy]]\n\n* '''\"Misery\"'''\n:Sung by [[The Moffatts]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Broadcast ==\nAfter 65 episodes, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] ceased production.
