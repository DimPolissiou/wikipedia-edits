He was possibly a native of [[Somerset]], and is believed to have been born in 1648 or 1649. Nothing is known of his parentage, although he is presumed to have come from a strict [[Quakers|Quaker]] family.

One of the early members of the Friends' (Quakers') meeting at [[Devonshire House]], he married there, on 18 April 1676, Mary, daughter of Jeremiah Stevens, maltster, of [[High Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire. In the register-book he is described as \"clockmaker, of [[St Martin's Le Grand|Martins-le-Grand]] in the [[City and liberty of Westminster|liberty of Westminster]]\".\n\nSoon afterwards, Quare moved to the parish of [[St Anne and St Agnes]] within Aldersgate, where in 1678, for refusing to pay a rate for the maintenance of the clergy of the parish, his goods to the value of \u00a35 were seized to defray a fine of \u00a32 12s. 6d. The next year, \"for fines imposed for refusing to defray the charge of the militia, two clocks and two watches were taken from him\". A little later he settled in [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]], whence he migrated in 1685 to the King's Arms in [[Exchange Alley]], long a favourite home for watchmakers. In 1683 Quare and five other Friends had \"their goods seized to the value of \u00a3195 17s. 6d. for attending meeting at White Hart Court\". On 4 June 1686 Quare, with about fifty other Friends, was summoned to appear before the commissioners appointed by James II to sit at [[Clifford's Inn]] to hear their grievances. He was fined again in 1689, but he was subsequently taken into William III's favour. On Quare's petition two Friends imprisoned in [[Westmorland]] were released, and on 2 May 1695 he introduced four Friends, including [[George Whitehead (Quaker leader)|George Whitehead]] and Gilbert Latey, to a private interview with [[William III of England|William III]]. Quare and nineteen other quakers signed a petition to the commons, presented by Edmond Waller on 7 February 1696.\n\nWhen Quare began his career [[horology]] was rapidly advancing. The [[pendulum]] was a novelty; so were the spiral spring and anchor [[escapement]] invented by [[Robert Hooke]], and the [[Fusee (horology)|fusee chain]]. To Quare belongs the honour of inventing repeating watches, and it is also claimed for him that he adapted the concentric minute hand. If he was actually the inventor of the latter, he must have constructed it early in his career, for two concentric hands are shown in a diagram in [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' (1673).<ref>[[Christiaan Huygens]], ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' (Paris, 1673), p. 4.</ref> Clocks and watches made by Quare with only one hand are extant, or with two circles and pointers, one for the hours and another for the minutes, and the concentric invention did not quickly supersede this arrangement even in Quare's own workshop. In the ''London Gazette'' for 25\u201329 March 1686, is an advertisement for a lost \"pendulum\" watch made by Quare, that had only one hand, but was curiously arranged to give the minutes: \"it had but 6 hours upon the dial plate, with 6 small cipher figures within every hour; the hand going round every 6 hours, which shows also the minutes between every hour.\"\n\nWhen in 1687 [[Edward Booth (priest)|Edward Booth]], alias Barlow, applied for a patent for \"pulling or repeating clocks and watches\", the Clockmakers' Company successfully opposed the application on the ground that the alleged invention was anticipated by a watch previously invented and made by Quare. The latter's watch was superior to Barlow's, because it repeated both the hour and the quarter with one pressure, while Barlow's required two.\n\nWood gives an account of a watch made by Quare for James II, but the references are inaccurate.<ref>Wood, ''Curiosities of Clocks and Watches'', p. 295</ref> Quare is also said to have made a repeating watch for William III. He certainly made a very fine clock for the king, which went for a year without rewinding. Being specially made for a bedroom, it did not strike. The clock still stands in its original place, by the side of the king's bed, in [[Hampton Court Palace]], and shows sundial time, latitude and longitude, and the course of the sun. In 1836 the clock was altered by [[Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy]], the equation work being disconnected and partly removed, a new pendulum provided, and the clock fitted with a deadbeat escapement. The case is surmounted by five well-modelled gilt figures, the complete height being over ten feet. The going train is similar to another year clock made by Quare.<ref>Described in {{cite book |first=F. J. |last=Britten |title=Former Clock and Watchmakers |place=London |publisher=E. & F. N. Spon |year=1894 |pages=96\u2013100 }}</ref> F. J. Britten says of it: \"It seems almost incredible for 81&nbsp;lb. \u00d7 4&nbsp;ft. 6 in. to drive the clock for more than 13 months, but everything was done that was possible to economise the force. The very small and light swing wheel, the balanced minute hand, and the small shortened arbors with extra fine pivots, all conduce to the end in view.\" The weight in the Hampton Court clock was still less, being only 72&nbsp;lb. There is also at the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Royal Hospital, Greenwich]], a very curious clock by Quare with a double pendulum.\n\nOn 2 August 1695, in the face of some opposition from the Clockmakers' Company, a patent was granted to Quare for a portable barometer. The barometer, in the words of the patent, \"may be removed and carried to any place, though turned upside down, without spilling one drop of the quicksilver or letting any air into the tube, and yet nevertheless the air shall have the same liberty to operate upon it as on those common ones now in use with respect to the weight of the atmosphere\". None of these portable barometers are known to exist, but a good example of a \"common\" sort made by Quare is at Hampton Court.\n\nQuare was chosen a member of the court of assistants in the Clockmakers' Company in 1697, warden in 1705 and 1707, and master of the company in 1708.<ref name=\"didroyalfriendshipalter\">{{cite journal |first= Joanna Shaw | last = Myers |title=Did Royal Friendship Alter Quaker Influence on English History? |journal=Quaker History |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=100\u2013107|jstor=41947734 | date = Fall 1991 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nQuare died on 21 March 1724, aged 75, at his country house at [[Croydon]], and was buried in the [[Quaker Gardens, Islington|Quaker burial ground]], Chequer Alley, Bunhill Fields, on 27 March. The ''Daily Post'' of Thursday, 26 March, reported: \"Last week dy'd Mr. Daniel Quare, watchmaker in Exchange Alley, who was famous both here and at foreign courts for the great improvements he made in that art, and we hear he is succeeded in his shop and trade by his partner, Mr. Horseman\", i.e. Stephen Horseman, apprenticed to Quare in 1702, and admitted to the Clockmakers' Company in 1709.<ref>Parker, ''London News'', 30 March 1724</ref>\n\nHis will, made on 3 May 1723, was proved on 26 March 1724 by Jeremiah, his son and executor. Among other bequests, Quare left to his wife \u00a32,800, all his household goods, both in London and in the country, and \"the two gold watches she usually wears, one of them being a repeater and the other a plain watch\". The widow lived with her son, Jeremiah, until her death on 4 November 1728 (aged 77) in the parish of [[St Dionis Backchurch]], Lime Street. Of Quare's children who survived infancy there were, besides the son Jeremiah, a \"merchant\", three daughters: Anna, married to John Falconer; Sarah, wife of Jacob Wyan; and Elizabeth, who married, on 10 November 1715, [[Silvanus Bevan]], \"citizen and apothecary\". At Elizabeth's wedding, [[Sarah, duchess of Marlborough]], signed the register (along with seventy-two other witnesses).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Quare, Daniel|volume=47}}\n* {{BBKL|q/quare_d|band=31|autor=Claus Bernet|spalten=1089-1092}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia|first=E.

{"title_page": "Constanze Mozart", "text_new": "[[File:Costanze Mozart by Lange 1782.jpg|thumb|Constanze Mozart as portrayed in 1782 by her brother-in-law [[Joseph&nbsp;Lange]]]]\n'''Maria Constanze C\u00e4cilia Josepha Johanna Aloysia Mozart''' ([[n\u00e9e]] '''Weber''') (5 January 1762 \u2013 6 March 1842) was an Austrian woman who trained as a singer. She married twice, her first husband being [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and was later, jointly with her second husband [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen]], Mozart's biographer. She and Mozart had six children: [[Karl Thomas Mozart]], [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], and other four who died in infancy.\n\n==Early years==\nConstanze Weber was born in [[Zell im Wiesental]], a town near [[L\u00f6rrach]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the south-west of Germany, then [[Further Austria]]. Her mother was [[C\u00e4cilia Weber]], n\u00e9e Stamm. Her father, Fridolin Weber, worked as a \"[[double bass]] player, [[prompter (opera)|prompter]], and [[music copyist]].\"<ref name=\"Grove, article Mozart, section 4\">{{harvnb|Grove|loc=article \"Mozart\", section 4}}</ref> Fridolin's half-brother was the father of composer [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. Constanze had two older sisters, [[Josepha Weber|Josepha]] and [[Aloysia Weber|Aloysia]], and one younger one, [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]]. All four were trained as singers and Josepha and Aloysia both went on to distinguished musical careers, later on performing in the premieres of a number of Mozart's works.\n\nDuring most of Constanze's upbringing, the family lived in her mother's hometown of [[Mannheim]], an important cultural, intellectual, and musical center of the time. The 21-year-old Mozart visited Mannheim in 1777 on a job-hunting tour with his [[Anna Maria Mozart|mother]] and developed a close relationship with the Weber family. He fell in love, not with the 15-year-old Constanze, but with Aloysia.<ref name=\"Solomon 1995\">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p={{page missing|date=September 2019}}}}</ref> While Mozart was in Paris, Aloysia obtained a position as a singer in Munich, and the family accompanied her there. She rejected Mozart when he passed through Munich on his way back to Salzburg.<ref name=\"Solomon 1995\" />\n\nThe family moved to Vienna in 1779, again following Aloysia as she pursued her career. One month after their arrival, Fridolin died.<ref name=\"Solomon 1995\" /> By the time Mozart moved to Vienna in 1781, Aloysia had married [[Joseph Lange]], who agreed to help C\u00e4cilia Weber with an annual stipend, and she also took in boarders to make ends meet. The house where the Webers lived (on the second floor) was at Am Peter 11, and bore a name (as houses often did at the time): ''Zum Auge Gottes'' (\"God's Eye\").{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=253}}\n\n==Marriage to Mozart==\nOn first arriving in Vienna on 16 March 1781,{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|p=193}} Mozart stayed at the house of the [[Teutonic Order]] with the staff of his patron, [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|Archbishop Colloredo]]. In May, he \"was obliged to leave,\" and chose to board in the Weber household, originally intending \"to stay there only a week.\"{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|p=196}}\n\nAfter a while, it became apparent to C\u00e4cilia Weber that Mozart was courting Constanze, now 19, and in the interest of propriety, she requested that he leave.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=255}} Mozart moved out on 5 September to a third-floor room in the [[Graben, Vienna|Graben]].\n\nThe courtship continued, not entirely smoothly. Surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly broke up in April 1782, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her calves in a parlor game).{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=259}} Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his father, [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]].{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=258}}\n\nThe marriage finally took place in an atmosphere of crisis. [[Daniel Heartz]] suggests that eventually Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time.{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}} Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, \"All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case of a man who has already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question.\"{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}} Heartz relates, \"Constanze's sister [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]] had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [presumably from Mozart's apartment].\"{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}} On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldst\u00e4tten, asking: \"Can the police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today.\"{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}}\n\nThe marriage did indeed take place that day, 4 August 1782. In the marriage contract, Constanze \"assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which&nbsp;[...] the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden\", with the total \"to pass to the survivor\". Further, all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both.{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|p=204}} A day after the marriage took place, the consent of Wolfgang's father arrived in the mail.\n\nThe couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy.\n\n#Raimund Leopold (17 June \u2013 19 August 1783)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=2&jahr=1783 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1783], [[Mozarteum]]</ref>\n#[[Karl Thomas Mozart]] (21 September 1784 \u2013 31 October 1858)\n#Johann Thomas Leopold (18 October \u2013 15 November 1786)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=2&jahr=1786 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1786], Mozarteum</ref>\n#Theresia Constanzia Adelheid Friedericke Maria Anna (27 December 1787 \u2013 29 June 1788)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=4&jahr=1787 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1787], Mozarteum</ref><ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=2&jahr=1788 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1788], Mozarteum</ref>\n#Anna Maria (b/d 16 November 1789)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=4&jahr=1789 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1789], Mozarteum</ref>\n#[[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]] (26 July 1791 \u2013 29 July 1844)\n\n==After Mozart's death==\n[[File:Costanze Mozart by Hanson 1802.jpg|thumb|upright|Constanze in 1802, portrait by [[Hans Hansen (portrait painter)|Hans Hansen]]]]\n[[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart died]] in 1791, leaving debts and placing Constanze in a difficult position.

From 1810 to 1820, they lived in Copenhagen, and subsequently travelled throughout Europe, especially Germany and Italy. They settled in Salzburg in 1824. Both worked on a biography of Mozart; Constanze eventually published it in 1828, two years after her second husband's death.\n\nDuring Constanze's last years in Salzburg, she had the company of her two surviving sisters, [[Aloysia Weber|Aloysia]] and [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]], also widows, who moved to Salzburg and lived out their lives there.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=502}}\n\n==Influences on Mozart's music==\n[[File:Grabstein.Constantia.Nissen.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone of Constanze Mozart, cemetery of Sebastian Church, Salzburg]]\nConstanze was a trained musician and played a role in her husband's career. Two instances can be given.\n\nThe extraordinary writing for [[soprano]] solo in the [[Great Mass in C minor]] (for example, in the \"Christe eleison\" section of the Kyrie movement, or the aria \"Et incarnatus est\") was intended for Constanze, who sang in the 1783 premiere of this work in Salzburg. [[Maynard Solomon]] in his Mozart biography speculatively describes the work as a love offering.\n\nDuring the period of the couple's courtship, Mozart began making visits to Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]], who let him examine his extensive collection of manuscripts of work by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Mozart was excited by this material, and he prepared a number of compositions in [[Baroque music|Baroque style]]. An important impetus was Constanze, who apparently had fallen in love with Baroque [[counterpoint]]. This is known from a letter Mozart wrote to his sister [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]] on 20 April 1782. The letter was accompanied by a manuscript copy of the composer's [[Fantasy No. 1 with Fugue (Mozart)|Fantasy and Fugue, K. 394]].\n<blockquote>I composed the [[fugue]] first and wrote it down while I was thinking out the prelude. I only hope that you will be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of H\u00e4ndel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of H\u00e4ndel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.<ref>Text of letter taken from http://www.schillerinstitut.dk/bach.html. Not all scholars take Mozart at his word; he had a motivation to exaggerate Constanze's refinement and taste, since Leopold was opposed strongly to his son marrying her ({{harvnb|Heartz|2009|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Halliwell|1998}}).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe experience of writing in the Baroque style had an important influence on Mozart's the later work in the [[Great Mass in C minor, K. 427|C Minor Mass]] as well as in later secular works, such as the last movement of the [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|41st Symphony]] or the opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n\n==Treatment by biographers==\n[[File:Constanze Weber 1840 full.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|1840 [[daguerreotype]] reportedly showing Constanze Mozart (see text for serious doubts), front on the far left, two years before her death; Bavarian composer {{ill|Max Keller (composer)|de|Max Keller (Komponist)|lt=Max Keller}} is seated center front and to his left is his wife, Josefa; from left to right in rear are the family cook, Philip Lattner (Keller's brother in law), and Keller's daughters, Luise and Josefa; the image was first brought to scholarly attention in 1958.<ref>Mueller von Asow, E. H. \"Zu einer unbekannten Photographie Constanze Mozarts.\", ''[[\u00d6sterreichische Musikzeitschrift]]'' 13 (1958): 93\u201395.</ref>]]\nAccording to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Constanze has been treated harshly and unfairly by a number of her biographers: \"Early 20th-century scholarship severely criticized her as unintelligent, unmusical and even unfaithful, and as a neglectful and unworthy wife to Mozart. Such assessments (still current) were based on no good evidence, were tainted with anti-feminism and were probably wrong on all counts.\"<ref name=\"Grove, article Mozart, section 4\" /> Complaints about unfairness to Constanze also appear in several recent Mozart biographies: [[Volkmar Braunbehrens|Braunbehrens]] (1990), Solomon (1995), and Halliwell (1998).<ref>The earlier critics accused of unfairness variously include [[Alfred Einstein]], [[Wolfgang Hildesheimer]], and {{ill|Arthur Schurig|de}}.</ref>\n\n==Alleged photograph==\nSince first being brought to scholarly attention in 1958, numerous media sources and publications have asserted over the years that a single surviving photograph reportedly showing the only known image of Mozart's widow is that of Constanze (Mozart) Nissen herself at age 78. The photo, or [[daguerreotype]], was supposedly taken in [[Alt\u00f6tting]], Bavaria in October 1840 outside the home of [[composer]] Max Keller. However, several Mozart scholars have refuted the claim as false for various reasons. First, the photograph could not have been taken outdoors since claims that the lenses to produce such images were not invented by [[Joseph Petzval]] until after Constanze had died in 1842.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/16/entertainment/ca-artsnotes16.1 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 16, 2006|author=Chris Pasles|title=Photo of Mozart's wife a hoax |accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref> Second, it is documented that Constanze was crippled from debilitating [[arthritis]] in her final years of life. As Agnes Selby, author of ''Constanze, Mozart's Beloved'', offered her opinion regarding the photograph on the Classical Music Guide Forums website on July 8, 2006: \"There is absolutely no way she could have traveled to visit Maximillian Keller during the period when the photograph was taken.

She and Mozart had six children: [[Karl Thomas Mozart]], [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], and other four who died in infancy.\n\n==Early years==\nConstanze Weber was born in [[Zell im Wiesental]], a town near [[L\u00f6rrach]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the south-west of Germany, then [[Further Austria]]. Her mother was [[C\u00e4cilia Weber]], n\u00e9e Stamm. Her father, Fridolin Weber, worked as a \"[[double bass]] player, [[prompter (opera)|prompter]], and [[music copyist]].\"<ref name=\"Grove, article Mozart, section 4\">{{harvnb|Grove|loc=article \"Mozart\", section 4}}</ref> Fridolin's half-brother was the father of composer [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. Constanze had two older sisters, [[Josepha Weber|Josepha]] and [[Aloysia Weber|Aloysia]], and one younger one, [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]]. All four were trained as singers and Josepha and Aloysia both went on to distinguished musical careers, later on performing in the premieres of a number of Mozart's works.\n\nDuring most of Constanze's upbringing, the family lived in her mother's hometown of [[Mannheim]], an important cultural, intellectual, and musical center of the time. The 21-year-old Mozart visited Mannheim in 1777 on a job-hunting tour with his [[Anna Maria Mozart|mother]] and developed a close relationship with the Weber family. He fell in love, not with the 15-year-old Constanze, but with Aloysia.<ref name=\"Solomon 1995\">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p={{page missing|date=September 2019}}}}</ref> While Mozart was in Paris, Aloysia obtained a position as a singer in Munich, and the family accompanied her there. She rejected Mozart when he passed through Munich on his way back to Salzburg.<ref name=\"Solomon 1995\" />\n\nThe family moved to Vienna in 1779, again following Aloysia as she pursued her career. One month after their arrival, Fridolin died.<ref name=\"Solomon 1995\" /> By the time Mozart moved to Vienna in 1781, Aloysia had married [[Joseph Lange]], who agreed to help C\u00e4cilia Weber with an annual stipend, and she also took in boarders to make ends meet. The house where the Webers lived (on the second floor) was at Am Peter 11, and bore a name (as houses often did at the time): ''Zum Auge Gottes'' (\"God's Eye\").{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=253}}\n\n==Marriage to Mozart==\nOn first arriving in Vienna on 16 March 1781,{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|p=193}} Mozart stayed at the house of the [[Teutonic Order]] with the staff of his patron, [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|Archbishop Colloredo]]. In May, he \"was obliged to leave,\" and chose to board in the Weber household, originally intending \"to stay there only a week.\"{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|p=196}}\n\nAfter a while, it became apparent to C\u00e4cilia Weber that Mozart was courting Constanze, now 19, and in the interest of propriety, she requested that he leave.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=255}} Mozart moved out on 5 September to a third-floor room in the [[Graben, Vienna|Graben]].\n\nThe courtship continued, not entirely smoothly. Surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly broke up in April 1782, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her calves in a parlor game).{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=259}} Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his father, [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]].{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=258}}\n\nThe marriage finally took place in an atmosphere of crisis. [[Daniel Heartz]] suggests that eventually Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time.{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}} Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, \"All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case of a man who has already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question.\"{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}} Heartz relates, \"Constanze's sister [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]] had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [presumably from Mozart's apartment].\"{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}} On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldst\u00e4tten, asking: \"Can the police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today.\"{{sfn|Heartz|2009|p=47}}\n\nThe marriage did indeed take place that day, 4 August 1782. In the marriage contract, Constanze \"assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which&nbsp;[...] the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden\", with the total \"to pass to the survivor\". Further, all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both.{{sfn|Deutsch|1965|p=204}} A day after the marriage took place, the consent of Wolfgang's father arrived in the mail.\n\nThe couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy.\n\n#Raimund Leopold (17 June \u2013 19 August 1783)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=2&jahr=1783 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1783], [[Mozarteum]]</ref>\n#[[Karl Thomas Mozart]] (21 September 1784 \u2013 31 October 1858)\n#Johann Thomas Leopold (18 October \u2013 15 November 1786)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=2&jahr=1786 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1786], Mozarteum</ref>\n#Theresia Constanzia Adelheid Friedericke Maria Anna (27 December 1787 \u2013 29 June 1788)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=4&jahr=1787 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1787], Mozarteum</ref><ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=2&jahr=1788 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1788], Mozarteum</ref>\n#Anna Maria (b/d 16 November 1789)<ref>[http://www.mozarteum.at/en/mozart-life-and-work/mozarts-calender.html?id=449&suche=&seite=4&jahr=1789 Mozart Day by Day \u2013 1789], Mozarteum</ref>\n#[[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]] (26 July 1791 \u2013 29 July 1844)\n\n==After Mozart's death==\n[[File:Costanze Mozart by Hanson 1802.jpg|thumb|upright|Constanze in 1802, portrait by [[Hans Hansen (portrait painter)|Hans Hansen]]]]\n[[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart died]] in 1791, leaving debts and placing Constanze in a difficult position.

From 1810 to 1820, they lived in Copenhagen, and subsequently travelled throughout Europe, especially Germany and Italy. They settled in Salzburg in 1824. Both worked on a biography of Mozart; Constanze eventually published it in 1828, two years after her second husband's death.\n\nDuring Constanze's last years in Salzburg, she had the company of her two surviving sisters, [[Aloysia Weber|Aloysia]] and [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]], also widows, who moved to Salzburg and lived out their lives there.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=502}}\n\n==Influences on Mozart's music==\n[[File:Grabstein.Constantia.Nissen.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone of Constanze Mozart, cemetery of Sebastian Church, Salzburg]]\nConstanze was a trained musician and played a role in her husband's career. Two instances can be given.\n\nThe extraordinary writing for [[soprano]] solo in the [[Great Mass in C minor]] (for example, in the \"Christe eleison\" section of the Kyrie movement, or the aria \"Et incarnatus est\") was intended for Constanze, who sang in the 1783 premiere of this work in Salzburg. [[Maynard Solomon]] in his Mozart biography speculatively describes the work as a love offering.\n\nDuring the period of the couple's courtship, Mozart began making visits to Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]], who let him examine his extensive collection of manuscripts of work by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Mozart was excited by this material, and he prepared a number of compositions in [[Baroque music|Baroque style]]. An important impetus was Constanze, who apparently had fallen in love with Baroque [[counterpoint]]. This is known from a letter Mozart wrote to his sister [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]] on 20 April 1782. The letter was accompanied by a manuscript copy of the composer's [[Fantasy No. 1 with Fugue (Mozart)|Fantasy and Fugue, K. 394]].\n<blockquote>I composed the [[fugue]] first and wrote it down while I was thinking out the prelude. I only hope that you will be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of H\u00e4ndel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of H\u00e4ndel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.<ref>Text of letter taken from http://www.schillerinstitut.dk/bach.html. Not all scholars take Mozart at his word; he had a motivation to exaggerate Constanze's refinement and taste, since Leopold was opposed strongly to his son marrying her ({{harvnb|Heartz|2009|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Halliwell|1998}}).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe experience of writing in the Baroque style had an important influence on Mozart's the later work in the [[Great Mass in C minor, K. 427|C Minor Mass]] as well as in later secular works, such as the last movement of the [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|41st Symphony]] or the opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n\n==Treatment by biographers==\n[[File:Constanze Weber 1840 full.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|1840 [[daguerreotype]] reportedly showing Constanze Mozart (see text for serious doubts), front on the far left, two years before her death; Bavarian composer {{ill|Max Keller (composer)|de|Max Keller (Komponist)|lt=Max Keller}} is seated center front and to his left is his wife, Josefa; from left to right in rear are the family cook, Philip Lattner (Keller's brother in law), and Keller's daughters, Luise and Josefa; the image was first brought to scholarly attention in 1958.<ref>Mueller von Asow, E. H. \"Zu einer unbekannten Photographie Constanze Mozarts.\", ''[[\u00d6sterreichische Musikzeitschrift]]'' 13 (1958): 93\u201395.</ref>]]\nAccording to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Constanze has been treated harshly and unfairly by a number of her biographers: \"Early 20th-century scholarship severely criticized her as unintelligent, unmusical and even unfaithful, and as a neglectful and unworthy wife to Mozart. Such assessments (still current) were based on no good evidence, were tainted with anti-feminism and were probably wrong on all counts.\"<ref name=\"Grove, article Mozart, section 4\" /> Complaints about unfairness to Constanze also appear in several recent Mozart biographies: [[Volkmar Braunbehrens|Braunbehrens]] (1990), Solomon (1995), and Halliwell (1998).<ref>The earlier critics accused of unfairness variously include [[Alfred Einstein]], [[Wolfgang Hildesheimer]], and {{ill|Arthur Schurig|de}}.</ref>\n\n==Alleged photograph==\nSince first being brought to scholarly attention in 1958, numerous media sources and publications have asserted over the years that a single surviving photograph reportedly showing the only known image of Mozart's widow is that of Constanze (Mozart) Nissen herself at age 78. The photo, or [[daguerreotype]], was supposedly taken in [[Alt\u00f6tting]], Bavaria in October 1840 outside the home of [[composer]] Max Keller. However, several Mozart scholars have refuted the claim as false for various reasons. First, the photograph could not have been taken outdoors since claims that the lenses to produce such images were not invented by [[Joseph Petzval]] until after Constanze had died in 1842.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/16/entertainment/ca-artsnotes16.1 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 16, 2006|author=Chris Pasles|title=Photo of Mozart's wife a hoax |accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref> Second, it is documented that Constanze was crippled from debilitating [[arthritis]] in her final years of life. As Agnes Selby, author of ''Constanze, Mozart's Beloved'', offered her opinion regarding the photograph on the Classical Music Guide Forums website on July 8, 2006: \"There is absolutely no way she could have traveled to visit Maximillian Keller during the period when the photograph was taken.
