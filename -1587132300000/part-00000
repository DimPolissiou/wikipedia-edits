It is based on a short prayer from in Canto XXXIII of Dantes's ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'', the third part of his ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Verdi alludes on the counterpoint of [[Renaissance music]]. Each stanza is introduced by a new motif.

It lies in the most western part of the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]] neighborhood ([[Amsterdam-Centrum|Centrum]] borough), next to the [[Jordaan]], between the Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Westerkerk was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style according to designs by architect Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621). He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the 'Zuiderkerk'. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser (1595-1676) and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of 58 meters and a width of 29 meters. The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles. The three-aisled basilica has a rectangular plan with two transepts of equal dimensions. As a result, the plan for this church was given the form of two Greek crosses connected with each other.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\">{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|url=|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> (a patriarchal cross).\n\nSeveral older churches in Amsterdam, such as [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] and [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], were originally built before the Reformation and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation in 1578. The Westerkerk was one of the first purposely built Protestant churches. The [[Noorderkerk]] and [[Zuiderkerk]] preceded the Westerkerk. Today the Westerkerk remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants, and is still in use by the PKN (Protestantse Kerk in Nederland)\n\n==Main Duyschot organ==\n[[File:Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThere was no organ when the Westerkerk was consecrated on Whit Sunday the 8th of June in 1631. According to [[Calvinism]], playing instrumental music inside the church was still considered 'profane' in those days. It took many years of consultation until an organ was finally allowed. At first there was still talk of moving the small organ (koororgel) used in the Nieuwe- or the 'Oudekerk' but the pipes of this 'Oudekerk' choir organ were finally moved to the 'Zuiderkerk'. In 1681 the Westerkerk decided on commissioning organ builder Roelof Barentszn Duyschot for the construction of a new organ. Before it was finished he died and in 1686 the new organ was finished by his son Johannes Duyschot. Later in 1727 it was enlarged with an extra third keyboard by Christiaan Vater who learned his profession at [[Arp Schnitger]].\n\nMany alterations were done on the organ in the course of time. In the 19th century in 1895 even a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Lucky enough many of the old pipes and the wind chests were re used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and even a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.\n\nSo between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by [[Flentrop]] organ builders in [[Zaandam]] to its former mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and stop triggers beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. During the restoration of the inside of the church the organ was brought to Zaandam at Flentrop Orgelbouw for cleaning. In spring 2020 it was replaced in the church and on 18 April the new organist Evan Bogerd did the commissioning concert on internet (youtube at 8pm Amsterdam) For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants are necessary for triggering these stops.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=948LjA9ymCg See in this piece 'F\u00e8te Dieu' by Hendrik Andriessen how the stops work.

In August there is a free concert almost every day for a week 'Geen dag zonder Bach' ('Not a day without Bach') and the 'Grachten' (Canal) festival.  A noncommittal money collection is held after the concert at the exit. The money is used for the costs of the maintenance of the concerts and the organs. Music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685-1750) is performed almost weekly in the divine Sunday services. Bach was born in 1685, that is a year before the organ was finished but as far as we know, he never visited Amsterdam. His music sounds like it was made for this baroque instrument. See the site of Westerkerk for the Lunchtime concert schedule.\n\nOrganist in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4oVxGWSd4 Jos van der Kooy former organist performing Bach on the Duyschot organ]</ref>\n\n== Stoplist of the Duyschot Organ ==\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Rugwerk''' (Chaire organ) CDE\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holpijp 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Open Fluit 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sifflet 1\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sexquialter II-III ranks\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 16' Td\n|-\n|Prestant 8' Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen  8'\n|-\n|Octaaf 4' Td\n|-\n|Nasard 3' Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2' Td\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Scherp IV-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Sexquialter  III-IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Fagot 16'\n|-\n|Trompet 8'\n|-\n|\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III Bovenwerk''' (Oberwerk organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Baarpijp 8\u2032 \n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holfluit 4\u2032\n|-\n|Quint 3\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Woudfluit 2' Td\n|-\n|Tertiaan II-III ranks\n|-\n|Ruispijp III-VI ranks\n|-\n|Dulciaan 8\u2032\n|-\n|Vox Humana 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedals''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Bourdon 16\u2032\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032\n|-\n|Roerquint 6\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032\n|-\n|Bazuin 16\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 4\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\nCouplers and shutters:\n* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.\n* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P \n* Td = Treble is doubled\n\n== The paintings of the organ ==\n[[File:Interieur, orgel, detail - binnenzijde van het linker hoofdwerkluik, 'De Koningin van Scheba bezoekt Koning Salamo'.

On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. On the right panel we see the [[Queen of Sheba]] presenting gifts to King [[Solomon]]. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Li\u00e8ge in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th Century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The [[grisaille]]s on the 'rugwerk' panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The [[four evangelists]] with their items are showen. The inside of the 'rugwerk' shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.\n\n== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==\n[[File:Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThe small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered  in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restoration it was packed against the dust.\n\nStoplist\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"24\" cellpadding=\"16\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''I Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Prestant 4'\n|-\n| Gemshoorn 4'\n|-\n| Octaaf 2'\n|-\n| Sesquialter II ranks\n|-\n| Mixtuur III-IV ranks\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''II Borstwerk''' (Swell organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Roerfluit 4'\t\n|-\n| Nachthoorn 2'\t\n|-\n| Cimbel I-II ranks\t\n|-\n| Regaal 8'\n|-\n| ''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Subbas 16'\t\n|}\n|}\n* Couplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\n\n== The tower with the spire ==\n[[File:Part from Westertoren, gravure in Architectura Moderna - Amsterdam - 20013240 - RCE.jpg|left|75px|thumb|Not realized part from Westertoren, designed by Hendrick de Keyser]]\n[[File:WestertorenAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|150px|Westertoren]]\nThe tower, called the Westertoren (\"Western tower\"), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (\u00b1286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested [[Jacob van Campen]] was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/the-grachtengordel/the-westerkerk.aspx|title=The Westerkerk|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bells in the 'Westertoren' ==\nJust above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony|Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by [[Eijsbouts]] replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to 4 octaves and is tuned in [[Meantone temperament]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImw1T4X0xk Boudewijn Zwart performs: Sonata in d (2 parts) by [[Baldassare Galuppi]] - Choral 'Ich ruff zu Dir' by Johann Sebastian [[Bach]] - Entry of the Gladiators by [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]] and Wien bleibt Wien by [[Johann Schrammel]].]</ref> It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours. (At the request of the residents of the 'Jordaan' District.) The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from [[Zutphen]] in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F<sup>0</sup>) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509&nbsp;kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this [[Bourdon (bell)|Bourdon]] bell is: 'VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636' The smaller bell (A<sup>1</sup>) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city [[carillon]]eur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2015) Boudewijn Zwart is the City Carilloneur.\n\n[[File:Westerkerk van Amsterdam, luiden van klokken - SoundCloud - Beeld en Geluid.ogg|thumb|Westerkerk Amsterdam, ringing the bells for a service]]\nIn a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by Fran\u00e7ois Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the 'Our Father'. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon. The latest renovation works on the carillon were in 2006 when the tower was also renovated. In that year the crown on top was also painted in its original blue color.\n\n== Rembrandt ==\n[[File:Westerkerk - Kirche innen 6 Rembrandt-Epitaph.jpg|thumb|100px|Remembrance stone copied from ''[[The Night Watch]]''.]]\n[[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered 'kerkgraf' (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the 'Nachtwacht'. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>  Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt's life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.\n\nRembrandt's lover [[Hendrickje Stoffels]] was also buried here, as was Rembrandt's son [[Titus van Rijn]].<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are [[Nicolaes Berchem]], [[Gillis d'Hondecoeter]],  [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] and [[Govert Flinck]].\n\n== Dutch Royal Family ==\n[[File:Beatrix1966Claus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Beatrix and Claus van Amsberg]]\nOn March 10, 1966, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] married Prince [[Claus von Amsberg]] in the Westerkerk.

The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary \u2013 its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort.

It lies in the most western part of the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]] neighborhood ([[Amsterdam-Centrum|Centrum]] borough), next to the [[Jordaan]], between the Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Westerkerk was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style according to designs by architect Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621). He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the 'Zuiderkerk'. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser (1595-1676) and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of 58 meters and a width of 29 meters. The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles. The three-aisled basilica has a rectangular plan with two transepts of equal dimensions. As a result, the plan for this church was given the form of two Greek crosses connected with each other.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\">{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|url=|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> (a patriarchal cross).\n\nSeveral older churches in Amsterdam, such as [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] and [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], were originally built before the Reformation and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation in 1578. The Westerkerk was one of the first purposely built Protestant churches. The [[Noorderkerk]] and [[Zuiderkerk]] preceded the Westerkerk. Today the Westerkerk remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants, and is still in use by the PKN (Protestantse Kerk in Nederland)\n\n==Main Duyschot organ==\n[[File:Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThere was no organ when the Westerkerk was consecrated on Whit Sunday the 8th of June in 1631. According to [[Calvinism]], playing instrumental music inside the church was still considered 'profane' in those days. It took many years of consultation until an organ was finally allowed. At first there was still talk of moving the small organ (koororgel) used in the Nieuwe- or the 'Oudekerk' but the pipes of this 'Oudekerk' choir organ were finally moved to the 'Zuiderkerk'. In 1681 the Westerkerk decided on commissioning organ builder Roelof Barentszn Duyschot for the construction of a new organ. Before it was finished he died and in 1686 the new organ was finished by his son Johannes Duyschot. Later in 1727 it was enlarged with an extra third keyboard by Christiaan Vater who learned his profession at [[Arp Schnitger]].\n\nMany alterations were done on the organ in the course of time. In the 19th century in 1895 even a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Lucky enough many of the old pipes and the wind chests were re used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and even a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.\n\nSo between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by [[Flentrop]] organ builders in [[Zaandam]] to its former mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and stop triggers beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing.

Music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685-1750) is performed almost weekly in the divine Sunday services. Bach was born in 1685, that is a year before the organ was finished but as far as we know, he never visited Amsterdam. His music sounds like it was made for this baroque instrument. See the site of Westerkerk for the Lunchtime concert schedule.\n\nOrganist in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4oVxGWSd4 Jos van der Kooy former organist performing Bach on the Duyschot organ]</ref>\n\n== Stoplist of the Duyschot Organ ==\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Rugwerk''' (Chaire organ) CDE\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holpijp 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Open Fluit 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sifflet 1\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sexquialter II-III ranks\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 16' Td\n|-\n|Prestant 8' Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen  8'\n|-\n|Octaaf 4' Td\n|-\n|Nasard 3' Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2' Td\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Scherp IV-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Sexquialter  III-IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Fagot 16'\n|-\n|Trompet 8'\n|-\n|\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III Bovenwerk''' (Oberwerk organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Baarpijp 8\u2032 \n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holfluit 4\u2032\n|-\n|Quint 3\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Woudfluit 2' Td\n|-\n|Tertiaan II-III ranks\n|-\n|Ruispijp III-VI ranks\n|-\n|Dulciaan 8\u2032\n|-\n|Vox Humana 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedals''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Bourdon 16\u2032\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032\n|-\n|Roerquint 6\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032\n|-\n|Bazuin 16\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 4\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\nCouplers and shutters:\n* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.\n* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P \n* Td = Treble is doubled\n\n== The paintings of the organ ==\n[[File:Interieur, orgel, detail - binnenzijde van het linker hoofdwerkluik, 'De Koningin van Scheba bezoekt Koning Salamo'.

On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. On the right panel we see the [[Queen of Sheba]] presenting gifts to King [[Solomon]]. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Li\u00e8ge in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th Century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The [[grisaille]]s on the 'rugwerk' panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The [[four evangelists]] with their items are showen. The inside of the 'rugwerk' shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.\n\n== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==\n[[File:Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThe small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered  in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restauration it was packed against the dust.\n\nStoplist\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"24\" cellpadding=\"16\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''I Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Prestant 4'\n|-\n| Gemshoorn 4'\n|-\n| Octaaf 2'\n|-\n| Sesquialter II ranks\n|-\n| Mixtuur III-IV ranks\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''II Borstwerk''' (Swell organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Roerfluit 4'\t\n|-\n| Nachthoorn 2'\t\n|-\n| Cimbel I-II ranks\t\n|-\n| Regaal 8'\n|-\n| ''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Subbas 16'\t\n|}\n|}\n* Couplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\n\n== The tower with the spire ==\n[[File:Part from Westertoren, gravure in Architectura Moderna - Amsterdam - 20013240 - RCE.jpg|left|75px|thumb|Not realized part from Westertoren, designed by Hendrick de Keyser]]\n[[File:WestertorenAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|150px|Westertoren]]\nThe tower, called the Westertoren (\"Western tower\"), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (\u00b1286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested [[Jacob van Campen]] was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/the-grachtengordel/the-westerkerk.aspx|title=The Westerkerk|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bells in the 'Westertoren' ==\nJust above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony|Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by [[Eijsbouts]] replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to 4 octaves and is tuned in [[Meantone temperament]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImw1T4X0xk Boudewijn Zwart performs: Sonata in d (2 parts) by [[Baldassare Galuppi]] - Choral 'Ich ruff zu Dir' by Johann Sebastian [[Bach]] - Entry of the Gladiators by [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]] and Wien bleibt Wien by [[Johann Schrammel]].]</ref> It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours. (At the request of the residents of the 'Jordaan' District.) The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from [[Zutphen]] in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F<sup>0</sup>) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509&nbsp;kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this [[Bourdon (bell)|Bourdon]] bell is: 'VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636' The smaller bell (A<sup>1</sup>) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city [[carillon]]eur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2015) Boudewijn Zwart is the City Carilloneur.\n\n[[File:Westerkerk van Amsterdam, luiden van klokken - SoundCloud - Beeld en Geluid.ogg|thumb|Westerkerk Amsterdam, ringing the bells for a service]]\nIn a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by Fran\u00e7ois Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the 'Our Father'. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon. The latest renovation works on the carillon were in 2006 when the tower was also renovated. In that year the crown on top was also painted in its original blue color.\n\n== Rembrandt ==\n[[File:Westerkerk - Kirche innen 6 Rembrandt-Epitaph.jpg|thumb|100px|Remembrance stone copied from ''[[The Night Watch]]''.]]\n[[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered 'kerkgraf' (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the 'Nachtwacht'. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>  Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt's life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.\n\nRembrandt's lover [[Hendrickje Stoffels]] was also buried here, as was Rembrandt's son [[Titus van Rijn]].<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are [[Nicolaes Berchem]], [[Gillis d'Hondecoeter]],  [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] and [[Govert Flinck]].\n\n== Dutch Royal Family ==\n[[File:Beatrix1966Claus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Beatrix and Claus van Amsberg]]\nOn March 10, 1966, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] married Prince [[Claus von Amsberg]] in the Westerkerk. The 'Nieuwe Kerk' on Dam square where Royals normally have the weddings, was in renovation at that time.\n\n== Anne Frank ==\nThe Westerkerk is located close to the [[Anne Frank House]] where diarist [[Anne Frank]], her family and others were hid in the 'Achterhuis' from [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution for two years during [[World War II]]. The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary \u2013 its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort. A memorial statue of Anne Frank is located outside the church at Westermarkt.\n\n== Burials ==\n[[File:Amsterdam Westerkerk Innen Langhaus Ost 1.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Westerkerk]]\n* [[Nicolaes Pietersz.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>\n\nFrom the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]], which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints.\n\nThe ''Compact Disc Story'',<ref name=\"Immink\"/> told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter.

Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&nbsp;MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352\u00d7240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352\u00d7288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is negligible.<ref>{{cite news |author=Amy HarmonPublished: 12 October 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=MUSIC; What Price Music? |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=12 October 2003 |access-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175059/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Writable compact discs ==\n\n=== Recordable CD ===\n[[File:Maxell CD-R 700MB 40x 20040321.jpg|thumb|700&nbsp;[[MiB]] CD-R next to a [[mechanical pencil]] for scale]]\n{{Main|CD-R}}\nRecordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection-molded with a \"blank\" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Compact disc bird scarers.JPG|thumb|Old CDs hanging from a tree to scare birds from the crops.]]\nAfter the fall in popularity of CDs, old discs or failed CD-R have been repurposed, since the reflections of the sun on a moving plate may [[bird scarer|scare birds]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[Hidden Track]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n* [[List of optical disc manufacturers]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | work = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222035025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 22 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>\n\nFrom the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

Led by engineers [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] and [[Toshitada Doi]], the research pushed forward [[laser]] and [[optical disc]] technology.<ref name=\"BBC6950933\"/> After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.\n\nPhilips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[Compact Cassette]],<ref name=peek/> and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]], which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints.\n\nThe ''Compact Disc Story'',<ref name=\"Immink\"/> told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter.

Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352\u00d7240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352\u00d7288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Compact disc bird scarers.JPG|thumb|Old CDs hanging from a tree to scare birds from the crops.]]\nAfter the fall in popularity of CDs, old discs or failed CD-R have been repurposed, since the reflections of the sun on a moving plate may [[bird scarer|scare birds]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[Hidden Track]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n* [[List of optical disc manufacturers]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | work = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222035025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 22 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

By tracing an object, the moviemaker creates a silhouette (called a [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]) that can be used to extract that object from a scene for use on a different background. While [[Chroma key|blue- and green-screen techniques]] have made the process of layering subjects in scenes easier, rotoscoping still plays a large role in the production of visual effects imagery. Rotoscoping in the digital domain is often aided by [[Match moving|motion-tracking]] and [[onion-skinning]] software. Rotoscoping is often used in the preparation of [[Matte (filmmaking)#Garbage and holdout mattes|garbage mattes]] for other matte-pulling processes.\n\nRotoscoping has also been used to create a special visual effect (such as a glow, for example) that is guided by the matte or rotoscoped line. A classic use of traditional rotoscoping was in the original three ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, where the production used it to create the glowing [[lightsaber]] effect with a matte based on sticks held by the actors. To achieve this, effects technicians traced a line over each frame with the prop, then enlarged each line and added the glow.\n\n==History==\n\n===Predecessors===\n[[Eadweard Muybridge]] had some of his famous [[chronophotography|chronophotographic]] sequences painted on glass discs for the [[zoopraxiscope]] projector that he used in his popular lectures between 1880 and 1895. The first discs were painted on the glass in dark contours. Discs made between 1892 and 1894 had outlines drawn by Erwin Faber photographically printed on the disc and then coloured by hand, but these discs were probably never used in the lectures.<ref>http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muy%20blog3.htm#part15 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060646/http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muy%20blog3.htm |date=2018-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1902, [[Nuremberg]] toy companies [[Bing (company)|Gebr\u00fcder Bing]] and Ernst Plank were offering [[chromolithography|chromolithographed]] film loops for their toy [[cinematograph|kinematograph]]s.

It was known simply as the \"Fleischer Process\" on the early screen credits, and was essentially exclusive to Fleischer for several years. The live-movie reference for the character, later known as [[Koko the Clown]], was performed by his brother ([[Dave Fleischer]]) dressed in a [[clown]] costume.<ref>{{US patent reference|number=1242674|y=1917|m=10|d=09|inventor=Max Fleischer|title=Method of producing moving-picture cartoons}}</ref>\n\nOriginally conceived as a short-cut to animating, the rotoscope process proved time consuming due to the precise and laborious nature of tracing. Rotoscoping is achieved by two methods, rear projection and front surface projection. In either case, the results can have slight deviations from the true line due to the separation of the projected image and the surface used for tracing. Misinterpretations of the forms cause the line to wiggle, and the roto tracings must be reworked over an animation disc, using the tracings as a guide where consistency and solidity are important.\n\nFleischer ceased to depend on the rotoscope for fluid action by 1924, when Dick Huemer became the animation director and brought his animation experience from his years on the ''Mutt and Jeff'' series. Fleischer returned to rotoscoping in the 1930s for referencing intricate dance movements in his [[Popeye]] and [[Betty Boop]] cartoons. The most notable of these are the dance routines originating from jazz performer [[Cab Calloway]] in ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]'' (1932), ''[[Snow-White (1933 film)|Snow White]]'' (1933), and ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933). In these examples, the roto tracing were used as a guide for timing and positioning, while the cartoon characters of different proportions were drawn to conform to those positions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pointer |first1=Ray |year=2016 |title=The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer |publisher=Mcfarland |isbn=9781476663678 |oclc=948547933}}<!-- this was added in by the author (seemingly) User:RayPointer --></ref>\n\nFleischer's last applications of rotoscope were for the realistic human animation required for the lead character\u2014among others\u2014in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1939), and the human characters in his last feature, ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941). His most effective use of rotoscoping was in the action-oriented [[film noir]] ''[[Superman (1941 film)|Superman]]'' series of the early 1940s, where realistic movement was achieved on a level unmatched by conventional cartoon animation.\n\nContemporary uses of the rotoscope and its inherent challenges have included surreal effects in music videos such as Elvis Costello\u2019s \"[[Accidents Will Happen]]\", Klaatu's \"[[Klaatu (band)#Animated%20film%20project|Routine Day]]\", A-ha's \"[[Take On Me]]\", Kansas' \"[[All I Wanted (Kansas song)|All I Wanted]]\", the live performance scenes in [[Dire Straits]]' \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\", and the animated TV series ''[[Delta State (TV series)|Delta State]]''.\n\n===Uses by other studios===\nFleischer's patent expired by 1934, and other producers could then use rotoscoping freely. [[Walt Disney]] and his animators used the technique in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' during 1937.<ref>\"Reviving an ancient art\" The Times (London), August 5, 2006, FEATURES; The Knowledge; Pg. 10.

Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which produced the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons for [[Warner Bros.]], occasionally used rotoscoping. The 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon]] \"Petunia Natural Park\" from [[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|''The Captain and the Kids'']] featured a rotoscope version of [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Jackie]].\n\nRotoscoping was used extensively in China's first animated feature film, ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), which was released under very difficult conditions during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]].\n\nMost of the movies produced with it were adaptations of folk tales or poems\u2014for example, ''[[The Night Before Christmas (1951 movie)|The Night Before Christmas]]'' or ''[[The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish (film)|The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish]]''.

Linklater was the first director to use digital rotoscoping to create an entire feature movie. Additionally, a 2005\u201308 advertising campaign by [[Charles Schwab Corp.|Charles Schwab]] used Sabiston's rotoscoping work for a series of television commercials, with the tagline \"Talk to Chuck\". ''[[The Simpsons]]'' used rotoscope as a couch gag in the episode [[Barthood]], with Lisa describing it as \"a noble experiment that failed\".\n\nDuring 2013, the [[anime]] ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|The Flowers of Evil]]'' used rotoscoping to produce a look that differed greatly from its [[manga]] source material.

By tracing an object, the moviemaker creates a silhouette (called a [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]) that can be used to extract that object from a scene for use on a different background. While [[Chroma key|blue- and green-screen techniques]] have made the process of layering subjects in scenes easier, rotoscoping still plays a large role in the production of visual effects imagery. Rotoscoping in the digital domain is often aided by [[Match moving|motion-tracking]] and [[onion-skinning]] software. Rotoscoping is often used in the preparation of [[Matte (filmmaking)#Garbage and holdout mattes|garbage mattes]] for other matte-pulling processes.\n\nRotoscoping has also been used to create a special visual effect (such as a glow, for example) that is guided by the matte or rotoscoped line. A classic use of traditional rotoscoping was in the original three ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, where the production used it to create the glowing [[lightsaber]] effect with a matte based on sticks held by the actors. To achieve this, effects technicians traced a line over each frame with the prop, then enlarged each line and added the glow.\n\n==History==\n\n===Predecessors===\n[[Eadweard Muybridge]] had some of his famous [[chronophotography|chronophotographic]] sequences painted on glass discs for the [[zoopraxiscope]] projector that he used in his popular lectures between 1880 and 1895. The first discs were painted on the glass in dark contours. Discs made between 1892 and 1894 had outlines drawn by Erwin Faber photographically printed on the disc and then coloured by hand, but these discs were probably never used in the lectures.<ref>http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muy%20blog3.htm#part15 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060646/http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muy%20blog3.htm |date=2018-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1902, [[Nuremberg]] toy companies [[Bing (company)|Gebr\u00fcder Bing]] and Ernst Plank were offering [[chromolithography|chromolithographed]] film loops for their toy [[cinematograph|kinematograph]]s.

It was known simply as the \"Fleischer Process\" on the early screen credits, and was essentially exclusive to Fleischer for several years. The live-movie reference for the character, later known as [[Koko the Clown]], was performed by his brother ([[Dave Fleischer]]) dressed in a [[clown]] costume.<ref>{{US patent reference|number=1242674|y=1917|m=10|d=09|inventor=Max Fleischer|title=Method of producing moving-picture cartoons}}</ref>\n\nOriginally conceived as a short-cut to animating, the rotoscope process proved time consuming due to the precise and laborious nature of tracing. Rotoscoping is achieved by two methods, rear projection and front surface projection. In either case, the results can have slight deviations from the true line due to the separation of the projected image and the surface used for tracing. Misinterpretations of the forms cause the line to wiggle, and the roto tracings must be reworked over an animation disc, using the tracings as a guide where consistency and solidity are important.\n\nFleischer ceased to depend on the rotoscope for fluid action by 1924, when Dick Huemer became the animation director and brought his animation experience from his years on the ''Mutt and Jeff'' series. Fleischer returned to rotoscoping in the 1930s for referencing intricate dance movements in his [[Popeye]] and [[Betty Boop]] cartoons. The most notable of these are the dance routines originating from jazz performer [[Cab Calloway]] in ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]'' (1932), ''[[Snow-White (1933 film)|Snow White]]'' (1933), and ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933). In these examples, the roto tracing were used as a guide for timing and positioning, while the cartoon characters of different proportions were drawn to conform to those positions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pointer |first1=Ray |year=2016 |title=The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer |publisher=Mcfarland |isbn=9781476663678 |oclc=948547933}}<!-- this was added in by the author (seemingly) User:RayPointer --></ref>\n\nFleischer's last applications of rotoscope were for the realistic human animation required for the lead character\u2014among others\u2014in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1939), and the human characters in his last feature, ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941). His most effective use of rotoscoping was in the action-oriented [[film noir]] ''[[Superman (1941 film)|Superman]]'' series of the early 1940s, where realistic movement was achieved on a level unmatched by conventional cartoon animation.\n\nContemporary uses of the rotoscope and its inherent challenges have included surreal effects in music videos such as Klaatu's \"[[Klaatu (band)#Animated film project|Routine Day]]\", A-ha's \"[[Take On Me]]\", Kansas' \"[[All I Wanted (Kansas song)|All I Wanted]]\", the live performance scenes in [[Dire Straits]]' \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\", and the animated TV series ''[[Delta State (TV series)|Delta State]]''.\n\n===Uses by other studios===\nFleischer's patent expired by 1934, and other producers could then use rotoscoping freely. [[Walt Disney]] and his animators used the technique in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' during 1937.<ref>\"Reviving an ancient art\" The Times (London), August 5, 2006, FEATURES; The Knowledge; Pg. 10.

Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which produced the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons for [[Warner Bros.]], occasionally used rotoscoping. The 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon]] \"Petunia Natural Park\" from [[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|''The Captain and the Kids'']] featured a rotoscope version of [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Jackie]].\n\nRotoscoping was used extensively in China's first animated feature film, ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), which was released under very difficult conditions during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]].\n\nMost of the movies produced with it were adaptations of folk tales or poems\u2014for example, ''[[The Night Before Christmas (1951 movie)|The Night Before Christmas]]'' or ''[[The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish (film)|The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish]]''.

Housed within a four-story double [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] in the center of town,{{R|\"Insight2\"}} the ''Galleria'' is named after [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], the first king of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was designed in 1861 and built by architect [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Milan, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele.jpg|thumb|left|The building under construction]]\nThe structure consists of two glass-vaulted arcades intersecting in an [[octagon]] covering the street connecting [[Piazza del Duomo (Milan)|Piazza del Duomo]] to [[Piazza della Scala]]. The street is covered by an arching glass and [[cast iron]] roof, a popular design for 19th-century arcades, such as the [[Burlington Arcade]] in [[London]], which was the prototype for larger glazed [[shopping arcade]]s, beginning with the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert|Saint-Hubert Gallery]] in [[Brussels]] (opened in 1847), the [[Passage (department store)|Passazh]] in [[St Petersburg]] (opened in 1848), the [[Galleria Umberto I]] in [[Naples]] (opened in 1890) and the Budapest Galleria.\n\nThe central octagonal space is topped with a glass [[dome]]. The Milanese ''Galleria'' was larger in scale than its predecessors and was an important step in the evolution of the modern glazed and enclosed [[shopping mall]], of which it was the direct progenitor. It has inspired the use of the term ''galleria'' for many other shopping arcades and malls.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nOn the ground of the central octagonal, there are four mosaics portraying the [[coat of arms]] of the three capitals of the [[History of the Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] ([[Turin]], [[Florence]] and [[Rome]]) plus Milan's. Tradition says that if a person spins around three times with a heel on the testicles of the bull from [[Turin]] [[coat of arms]]  this will bring good luck. This practice causes damage to the mosaic: a hole developed on the place of the bull's genitals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe Galleria connects two of Milan's most famous landmarks: [[Milan Cathedral|The Duomo]] and the [[La Scala|Teatro Alla Scala]], but the Galleria is a landmark in its own right.\n\n== The iron-and-glass roof ==\n\nThe Milan gallery and its roof have been acknowledged as an important reference on 19th-century iron-and-glass architecture by Pevsner<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Building Types|last=Pevsner|first=N.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=Princeton, JC|pages=265|quote=|via=}}</ref> and Hitchcock.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|last=Hitchcock|first=H.-R.|publisher=Penguin books|year=1977|isbn=|location=Harmondsworth|pages=75, 120, 146|quote=|via=}}</ref> As one can still observe today, the roof consists of four barrel vaults (approximately 14.5 m in width and 8.5 m in height) that are crowned with a huge dome (around 37.5 m as internal diameter and 17.10 m in height).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Piazza del Duomo e Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milano tecnica dal 1859 al 1884|last=Chizzolini|first=G.|last2=Poggi|first2=F.|publisher=Ulrico Hoepli|year=1885|isbn=88-7685-022-8|location=Milano|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Jorini pointed out the accomplishments of this dome with special regard to the large dimensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jorini|first=A.

The depot, which ran alongside Main Avenue, was an Erie Railroad Type IV (types were determined in a 1918&ndash;1920 report to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]), with dimensions of {{convert|24.5|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, {{convert|17|ft|m}} high. The station depot was built out of wood, similar to a nearby watchman's shanty. The station location was home to a [[Railway Express Agency]] building constructed just to the west of the passenger station. The freight station was constructed several blocks to the east, constructed out of full brick.\n\nThe station boasted two passenger tracks, along with a gauntlet track, which served from mileposts 53.12 to 53.67 (which ran alongside the depot, with track miles from the [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|station]] at [[Cleveland, Ohio]], which served as the western terminus of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Atlantic & Great Western Railroad ===\nThe alignment that the Warren station was situated at was first started in July 1853, constructing the Franklin and Warren Railroad. This railroad changed names to the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] (A&GW) two months later. After connecting to the [[Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad]] in 1856, the railroads soon became part of the same system. The new A&GW opened complete passenger service in 1864, after being connected to the rest of the [[Erie Railroad|New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad]]. After becoming the [[New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad]] (NYPANO), the railroad soon changed hands again to the [[Erie Railroad]], which took over in 1896, and after being bought out by the railroad.{{sfn|Camp|2006|p=33}}\n\nDuring this time, a new Type IV station depot was opened in Warren,<ref name=\"iccreport\">{{Cite report\n | author     = Various officials\n | date       = 1918\u201320\n | title      = Valuation Report to the Interstate Commerce Commission\n | publisher  = [[Erie Railroad]]\n | location   = [[Cleveland, Ohio]]\n | section    = \n | page       =\n}}</ref> twenty years after the inaugural service. In the early 1900s, a new brick freight station was constructed at Pine Street, further down the line.

The study concluded that were two types of problems in the city, geographic and mixture of different kinds of traffic. Warren suffered from factors of problematic locations for the commercial core, schools, churches, industries, along with various classes of people. However, a main problem stemmed from the lack of roadways. Warren boasted an insufficient number of alternate routes through the city. South Street (US&nbsp;422 / OH&nbsp;169) had considerable problems in terms of traffic due to the fact that between Main Avenue and Pine Avenue, the Erie Railroad ran down the center of the street. The north side of the street was for moving traffic, but the southern side was purely for parking. The trains running down the track was a hazard to the pedestrians and automobiles, but otherwise posed no serious threat. In 1947, South Street recorded 12.5% of the accidents within the city of Warren, and by 1948, this had been reduced by 24%. This was due to reduction of speed limits and a city campaign to slow down.<ref name=widening1951 />\n\nThe professor proposed nine solutions to solving the issues of congestion within the city of Warren. The first proposed rerouting trucks out of the city's downtown, however it was dismissed due to the fact that the time lost in bypassing would equal time lost in congestion. Other proposals included turning Warren's downtown into a maze of one-way streets, upgrading South Street with traffic-based green lights, police supervision, radio campaigns and razing a \"slum\" neighborhood for parking. Two options however, called for the widening of streets, including South Street, which would require the upgrade along the stretch that the railroad shares between Main and Pine.<ref name=widening1951 /> \n[[File:Warren Erie Railroad station site (post-1966).jpg|left|thumb|Warren station post-1966 site in August 2012]]\nIn the later months of 1965, widening of South Street through the center of Warren began. As a result, the Railway Express Agency building next to the depot was demolished for construction of a new right-of-way on the parking side of South Street. The new right-of-way would leave South Street just east of the current depot site, which required the demolition. The first rails were placed in December 1965,{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=38}} and by January 1966, the new two track-main had been installed and put into use.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=39}} At that time, the old gauntlet track through Warren was being dismantled along South Street, which would be required to allow widening of South Street. It was at that point that the old station depot was closed by the Erie Lackawanna. The railroad did not put up proper signage for the change, deciding it was easier to scratch the notice of the station depot closing in the wood of the door. The freight depot located at the Pine Avenue crossing near South Street was renovated to allow a passenger depot area to be constructed within the building. The station depot back on South Street at Main Avenue was dismantled.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=39}}\n\n=== Closure ===\nDuring the later years of the Erie Railroad, Warren station had been served by twelve trains daily, including the ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]]''  which ran between [[Dearborn Station]] in Chicago and [[Hoboken Terminal]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], and local commuter runs from [[Youngstown (Erie Railroad station)|Youngstown]] to [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|Cleveland Union Terminal]] on the Mahoning first-subdivision.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=38}} In the late 1960s, the Erie Lackawanna was cutting several long distance trains from its schedule, including the ''[[Phoebe Snow (passenger train)|Phoebe Snow]]'' in November 1966.{{sfn|Taber|Taber|1980|p=146-148}} By June 1969, the Erie Lackawanna had applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to discontinue service of the ''Lake Cities'',<ref name=timetable61569 /> citing that is not worth the money being expedited combined with the railroad's financial status.

After [[Hurricane Agnes]] destroyed a lot of the right-of-way in 1972, and a [[Marion Yard]] in [[Marion, Ohio]] rebuild did not get the approved permits in 1975, the Erie Lackawanna agreed to merge with several other companies, including [[Penn Central]] to join a new government run railroad. On April 1, 1976, the merger went into effect and became the [[Conrail|Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail).<ref>{{cite news|title=ConRail Begins an Expensive Trip|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uGkaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HikEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5770,201221&dq=conrail&hl=en|accessdate=May 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=April 1, 1976|agency=[[Associated Press]]|location=[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]}}</ref>\n\nConrail agreed to maintain the commuter line, but after six month test run by Conrail, the agency officially ended service from Cleveland Union Terminal to Youngstown, due to loss of money.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

Instead, prosecutions were mainly for \"incidental malfeasance\" and convictions were hard to secure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=140-141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Now fighting with the Soviets against the Nazis, the Bulgarian Army tried to shield from liability officers who had abused Jewish forced labourers and lawyers engaged in the liquidation of Jews' assets mostly escaped sanction.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Most defendants were acquitted or received lenient penalties and most offenders were never charged.<ref name=\":5\" /> Two death sentences were handed down, including one for Alexander Belev, but he had already died in 1944 and was tried ''in absentia''.<ref name=\":5\" /> Shortly afterwards, records of the ''People's Court Panel VII'' trial were suppressed, including the \"abundant testimony\", and secreted, unpublished, in the exclusive archives of the communist [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]'s Interior Ministry.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

The professional associations of Bulgarian lawyers, physicians, craftsmen and the Union of Artists' Societies opposed the law with petitions.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The Holy Synod, governing body of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], was also quite critical, with high clergy such as [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Archbishop Stefan of Sofia]] and bishops Neofit of Vidin and [[Cyril of Bulgaria|Kyril of Plovdiv]] leading the opposition.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn January 1942, Germany outlined what it called the [[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.
