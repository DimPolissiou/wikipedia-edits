It is primarily involved in the sale of office supplies and related products, via retail channels and [[business-to-business]] (B2B)-oriented delivery operations.\n\nThe company opened its first store in [[Brighton, Massachusetts]] on May 1, 1986.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/staples-sold-for-69b-in-bid-for-turnaround/ |title=Staples sold for $6.9B in bid for turnaround|author=Matt Townsend|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=June 28, 2017}}</ref> By 1996, it had reached the [[Fortune 500]], and it later acquired the office supplies company [[Quill Corporation]].  In 2014, in the wake of increasing competition from e-commerce market, Staples began to close some of its locations. In 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire [[Office Depot]] and [[OfficeMax]]. However, the purchase was blocked under antitrust grounds due to the consolidation that would result.\n\nAfter the failed acquisition, Staples began to refocus its operations to downplay its [[brick-and-mortar]] outlets, and place more prominence on its B2B supply business. In 2017, after its sale to [[Sycamore Partners]], the company was effectively split into three \"independently managed and capitalized\" entities sharing the Staples name, separating its U.S. and [[Staples Canada|Canadian]] retail operations from the B2B business.\n\n==History==\nStaples was founded by [[Leo Kahn (entrepreneur)|Leo Kahn]] and [[Thomas G. Stemberg]], who were former rivals in the [[New England]] retail [[supermarket]] industry, and [[Myra Hart]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |first=Douglas|last=Martin|title=Leo Kahn, Trailblazer in Big-Box Retailing, Dies at 94 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/13kahn.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 12, 2011 |access-date=May 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name=wp>{{cite news |first=T.

While many products can be produced in-store, larger, more complex jobs, or jobs requiring special materials such as PVC signs are routed to production facilities in various locations through the country.\n\nMost locations have a limited service [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] shipping center offering air and ground services, ([[DHL Express|DHL]] in the United Kingdom stores; and [[FedEx]], [[Purolator Courier|Purolator]] in the Canadian stores), which is open during store hours. International shipping is only offered to Canada and Mexico from retail stores in the US. UPS services in US-based stores are not capable of handling AT&T or Dish Network returns with a label or QR codes from Amazon returns.\n\nIn Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate on a 24-hour basis and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy & Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as 'Instant Business Cards' customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Print & Marketing Stores (currently there are four [[New York City]] locations, and one in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]) where Print & Marketing Services is a brand of Staples.\n\n===Tech services===\nSome stores also feature Staples Tech Services (formerly EasyTech) an in-store and on-site service for [[Computer repair technician|PC repair]], PC upgrades, home and office [[computer network|networking]] setup, and PC tutorials.\n\nStarting in November 2005, Staples began a test called \"Heavy Up\" primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as \"Double Up\" was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with [[Best Buy]]'s [[Geek Squad]] and [[Circuit City]]'s Fire dog.\n\nBeginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the \"Easy Resident Tech\" program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours.\n\nOn January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the \"Easy Mobile Tech\" name with plans to install an 11' x 17' kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray \"Easy Tech\" polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores.\n\nBeginning in July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as \"EasyTechs\". Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green \"EasyTech\" emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company's new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main \"EasyTech\" who performs most of the more complex tasks.\n\nBeginning in November 2008, eleven concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known within the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as \"Tech Advisors\" and \"Solutions Advisors\". The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup.\n\nThese concept stores are mainly based in [[New Hampshire]], with stores in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]], [[West Lebanon, New Hampshire|West Lebanon]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. Some stores with this new concept also opened in [[Massachusetts]], including the [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]] store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech's services, including the [[Newington, Connecticut]], and [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] store.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n*[[Stationery]]\n*[[Staples (Canada)]], known as Bureau en Gros in [[Qu\u00e9bec]].\n*[[Winc]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dalkir, S. and F.

In 2014, in the wake of increasing competition from e-commerce market, Staples began to close some of its locations. In 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire [[Office Depot]] and [[OfficeMax]]. However, the purchase was blocked under antitrust grounds due to the consolidation that would result.\n\nAfter the failed acquisition, Staples began to refocus its operations to downplay its [[brick-and-mortar]] outlets, and place more prominence on its B2B supply business. In 2017, after its sale to [[Sycamore Partners]], the company was effectively split into three \"independently managed and capitalized\" entities sharing the Staples name, separating its U.S. and [[Staples Canada|Canadian]] retail operations from the B2B business.\n\n==History==\nStaples was founded by [[Leo Kahn (entrepreneur)|Leo Kahn]] and [[Thomas G.

While many products can be produced in-store, larger, more complex jobs, or jobs requiring special materials such as PVC signs are routed to production facilities in various locations through the country.\n\nMost locations have a limited service [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] shipping center offering air and ground services, ([[DHL Express|DHL]] in the United Kingdom stores; and [[FedEx]], [[Purolator Courier|Purolator]] in the Canadian stores), which is open during store hours. International shipping is only offered to Canada and Mexico from retail stores in the US. UPS services in US-based stores are not capable of handling AT&T or Dish Network returns with a label or QR codes from Amazon returns.\n\nIn Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate on a 24-hour basis and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy & Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as 'Instant Business Cards' customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Print & Marketing Stores (currently there are four [[New York City]] locations, and one in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]) where Print & Marketing Services is a brand of Staples.\n\n===Tech services===\nSome stores also feature Staples Tech Services (formerly EasyTech) an in-store and on-site service for [[Computer repair technician|PC repair]], PC upgrades, home and office [[computer network|networking]] setup, and PC tutorials.\n\nStarting in November 2005, Staples began a test called \"Heavy Up\" primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as \"Double Up\" was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with [[Best Buy]]'s [[Geek Squad]] and [[Circuit City]]'s Fire dog.\n\nBeginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the \"Easy Resident Tech\" program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours.\n\nOn January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the \"Easy Mobile Tech\" name with plans to install an 11' x 17' kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray \"Easy Tech\" polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores.\n\nBeginning in July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as \"EasyTechs\". Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green \"EasyTech\" emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company's new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main \"EasyTech\" who performs most of the more complex tasks.\n\nBeginning in November 2008, eleven concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known within the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as \"Tech Advisors\" and \"Solutions Advisors\". The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup.\n\nThese concept stores are mainly based in [[New Hampshire]], with stores in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]], [[West Lebanon, New Hampshire|West Lebanon]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. Some stores with this new concept also opened in [[Massachusetts]], including the [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]] store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech's services, including the [[Newington, Connecticut]], and [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] store.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n*[[Stationery]]\n*[[Staples (Canada)]], known as Bureau en Gros in [[Qu\u00e9bec]].\n*[[Winc]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dalkir, S. and F.
